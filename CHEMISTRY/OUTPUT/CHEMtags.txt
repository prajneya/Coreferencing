Diverse JJ
microorganisms NNS

some DT

i.e. FW

----------------
While IN
the DT

the DT

decline VB
rapidly RB
after IN
that DT

----------------
Both DT

high JJ
temperatures NNS
, ,
may MD
affect VB
the DT
rate NN
of IN
microbial JJ

----------------
At IN
low JJ
temperatures NNS
microbial JJ
growth NN
ceases NNS
, ,
because IN
of IN

and CC
at IN

there EX
is VBZ
a DT

The DT

----------------
Every DT

doubles VBZ
the DT

and CC
every DT

----------------
Normally RB
, ,
all DT

have VBP
a DT

temperature NN

----------------
Actually RB
, ,
the DT

In IN
fact NN

they PRP

It PRP

----------------
Likewise RB

----------------
Although IN

----------------
If IN

That DT
