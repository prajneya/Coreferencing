already ADV
seen VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
possible ADJ
to PART

We PRON
’ve VERB
already ADV
seen VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
possibility NOUN
of ADP
using VERB
something PRON
called VERB
blind ADJ
search NOUN
methods NOUN
like SCONJ
kit NOUN
generate NOUN
and CCONJ
test NOUN
, PUNCT

- PUNCT
first ADJ
search NOUN
, PUNCT
depth NOUN
- PUNCT
first ADJ
search NOUN
to PART
handle VERB
the DET
search NOUN
problem NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
the DET
problem NOUN
with ADP
these DET
methods NOUN
that DET
is ADV
, PUNCT
is AUX
going VERB
to PART
enter VERB
into ADP
entangled VERB
into ADP
something PRON
called VERB
combinatorial ADJ
explosion NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Combinatorial ADJ
explosion NOUN
is AUX
number NOUN
of ADP
options NOUN
that DET
you PRON
have AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
the DET
previous ADJ
module NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
simple ADJ
eight NUM
, PUNCT
five NUM
, PUNCT
three NUM
gallon NOUN
water NOUN
jug NOUN
problem NOUN
where ADV
we PRON
have AUX
only ADV
few ADJ
nodes NOUN
to PART
explore VERB
and CCONJ
we PRON
could VERB
get AUX
the DET
answer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
let VERB
us PRON
again ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
a DET
problem NOUN
like SCONJ
chess NOUN
and CCONJ
it PRON
becomes VERB
impossible ADJ
for ADP
us PRON
to PART
get AUX
an DET
answer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
so ADV
many ADJ
other ADJ
problems NOUN
which DET
we PRON
can VERB
talk VERB
about ADP
where ADV
we PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
even ADV
a DET
trivial ADJ
problem NOUN
like SCONJ
traveling VERB
salesman NOUN
result VERB
into ADP
a DET
serious ADJ
combinatorial ADJ
explosion NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
not PART
solve VERB
the DET
problem NOUN
in ADP
real ADJ
time NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
already ADV
seen VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
possible ADJ
to PART
learn VERB
from ADP
the DET
domain NOUN
which DET
moves NOUN
are AUX
better ADJ
than SCONJ
others NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
somehow ADV
manage VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
becomes VERB
easier ADJ
for ADP
us PRON
to PART
choose VERB
moves NOUN
which DET
are AUX
better ADJ
and CCONJ
complete VERB
the DET
search NOUN
process NOUN
in ADP
real ADJ
time NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
’s VERB
precisely ADV
the DET
theme NOUN
of ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
module NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
let VERB
us PRON
see VERB
what PRON
heuristic ADJ
search NOUN
methods NOUN
have AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
begin VERB
with ADP
the DET
introduction NOUN
of ADP
something PRON
called VERB
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
is AUX
a DET
function NOUN
which DET
is AUX
applied VERB
to ADP
a DET
state NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
ask VERB
a DET
chess NOUN
player NOUN
given VERB
a DET
board NOUN
position NOUN
, PUNCT
two NUM
board NOUN
positions NOUN
which DET
one PRON

better ADJ
, PUNCT
he PRON
would VERB
say VERB
this DET
is AUX
better ADJ
or CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
better ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Well INTJ
, PUNCT
how ADV
better ADV
, PUNCT
how ADV
much ADJ
there ADV
the DET
quantitative ADJ

then ADV
they PRON
’re VERB
not PART
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
view VERB
but CCONJ
here ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
thinking VERB
that DET
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’re VERB
going VERB
to PART
have AUX
a DET
quantitative ADJ
representation NOUN
of ADP
goodness NOUN
of ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
call VERB
it PRON
the DET
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN

or CCONJ
the DET
answer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
does AUX
that DET
mean VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
’m VERB
given VERB
a DET
chess NOUN
board NOUN
position NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
apply VERB
that SCONJ
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
, PUNCT
that SCONJ
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
will VERB
give VERB
you PRON
– PUNCT
give VERB
me PRON
a DET
value NOUN
between ADP
minus CCONJ
ten NUM
and CCONJ
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Minus CCONJ
ten NUM
is AUX
a DET
defeat NOUN
from ADP
me PRON
, PUNCT
ten NOUN
is AUX
a DET
win NOUN
for ADP
me PRON
and CCONJ
the DET
value NOUN
between ADP
minus CCONJ
ten NUM
to ADP
ten NUM
indicates VERB
the DET
merit NOUN
of ADP
that DET
particular ADJ
state NOUN
, PUNCT
how ADV
good ADJ
or CCONJ
bad ADJ
that SCONJ
state NOUN
is AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
about ADV
using VERB
domain NOUN
knowledge NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
the DET
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
take VERB
as SCONJ
an DET

? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
problem NOUN

----------------
And CCONJ
what PRON
it PRON
comes VERB
out ADP
with ADP
is AUX
the DET
value NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
how ADV
good ADJ
or CCONJ
bad ADJ
but CCONJ
ten NUM
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
ten NUM
to ADP
ten NUM
in ADP
conventional ADJ
way NOUN
but CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
design VERB
your DET
own ADJ
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
no DET
standard NOUN
as SCONJ
such ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
here ADV
Farmer PROPN

. PUNCT
----------------
Suppose VERB
if SCONJ
I PRON
design VERB
a DET

Chicken PROPN
Grain PROPN
problem NOUN
for ADP
this DET
assume NOUN
that SCONJ
there PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
says VERB
everybody PRON

, PUNCT
nothing PRON
, PUNCT
nobody PRON

, PUNCT
everybody PRON
is AUX
on ADP
the DET
right ADJ
hand NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
what PRON
does AUX
that DET
mean VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
That DET
means VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
ten NUM
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
win NOUN
for ADP
us PRON
, PUNCT
the DET
problem NOUN
is AUX
solved VERB
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
missionary ADJ
cannibal ADJ
case NOUN
sorry INTJ
it PRON
’s VERB
milk NOUN

problem NOUN
sorry INTJ
it PRON
’s VERB
zero NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
minus NOUN
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
does AUX
that DET
mean VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
I PRON
have AUX
nothing PRON
left VERB
in ADP
all DET
jugs NOUN
then ADV
something PRON
terribly ADV
wrong ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Minus CCONJ
ten NUM
, PUNCT
I PRON
’ll VERB
not PART
[ PUNCT
Indiscernible ADJ
] PUNCT
[ PUNCT
00:03:33 PROPN

solution NOUN
after ADP
this DET
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
is AUX
it PRON
kind ADV
of ADV
a DET
dead ADJ
end NOUN
or CCONJ
loss NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
a DET
failure NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
these DET
are AUX
examples NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
a DET
more ADV
important ADJ
thing NOUN
is AUX
I PRON
must VERB
have AUX
some DET
clear ADJ
means NOUN
of ADP
telling VERB
which DET

is AUX
better ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
assumed VERB
that SCONJ
eight NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
is AUX
the DET
beginning NOUN
this DET
thing NOUN
a DET
move NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
’m VERB
at ADP
a DET
typical ADJ
place NOUN
in ADP
eight NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
– PUNCT
eight NUM
, PUNCT
five NUM
, PUNCT
three NUM
gallon NOUN
water NOUN
jug NOUN
problem NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
have AUX
few ADJ
moves NOUN
possible ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
can VERB
move VERB
to ADP
eight NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
can VERB
move VERB
to ADP
six NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
can VERB
move VERB
to ADP
three NUM
, PUNCT
five NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
and CCONJ
I PRON
can VERB
move VERB
to ADP
three NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
three NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
suppose VERB
if SCONJ
my DET
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
says VERB
that SCONJ
eight NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
’s PART
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
is AUX
minus ADV
five NUM
, PUNCT
eight NUM
, PUNCT
six NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
is AUX
five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Three NUM
, PUNCT
five NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
is AUX
three NUM
and CCONJ
three NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
three NUM
is AUX
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
clearly ADV
indicates VERB
that SCONJ
six NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
is AUX
better ADJ
than SCONJ
others NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
should VERB
I PRON
choose VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
just ADV
choose VERB
six NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
how ADV
I PRON
can VERB
apply VERB
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
and CCONJ
get AUX
the DET
move NOUN
that DET
I PRON
should VERB
choose VERB
rather ADV
than SCONJ
exploring VERB
all DET
of ADP
them PRON
like SCONJ
breadth NOUN
- PUNCT
first ADJ
or CCONJ
exploring VERB
one NUM
branch NOUN
and CCONJ
then ADV
the DET
second ADJ
branch NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
third ADJ
branch NOUN
like SCONJ
DFS PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
’m VERB
not PART
doing VERB
it PRON
blindly ADV
and CCONJ
that DET
’s VERB
why ADV
this DET
is AUX
called VERB
guided VERB
search NOUN
and CCONJ
not PART
blind ADJ
search NOUN
or CCONJ
unguided ADJ
search NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Anyway INTJ
, PUNCT
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
problems NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
two NUM
questions NOUN
that DET
you PRON
’d VERB
probably ADV
ask VERB
before ADP
we PRON
proceed VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
First ADV
, PUNCT
how ADV
to PART
write VERB
this DET
function NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Important ADJ
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Second ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
this DET
function NOUN
, PUNCT
suppose VERB
if SCONJ
you PRON
know VERB
how ADV
to PART
write VERB
this DET
for ADP
them PRON
, PUNCT
how ADV
you PRON
put VERB
this DET
function NOUN
to PART
use VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
second ADJ
answer NOUN
is AUX
easy ADJ
to PART
– PUNCT
the DET
second ADJ
question NOUN
is AUX
easy ADJ
to PART
answer VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
I PRON
have AUX
this DET
function NOUN
I PRON
can VERB
just ADV
apply VERB
to ADP
a DET
state NOUN
and CCONJ
get AUX
that DET
value NOUN
and CCONJ
get AUX
that DET
value NOUN
between ADP
minus CCONJ
ten NUM
and CCONJ
ten NUM
and CCONJ
I PRON
’ll VERB
look VERB
at ADP
all DET
possible ADJ
alternatives NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Suppose VERB
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
I PRON
’m VERB
here ADV
and CCONJ
I PRON
have AUX
five NUM
different ADJ
moves NOUN
from ADP
this DET
I PRON
’ll VERB
apply VERB
this DET
function NOUN
to ADP
all DET
of ADP
them PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
side NOUN
which DET
one PRON
gives VERB
me PRON
the DET
better ADV
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
and CCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB
choose VERB
that DET
, PUNCT
that DET
’s VERB
simple ADJ
and CCONJ
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
that DET
’s VERB
not PART
that ADV
simple ADJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
’ll VERB
see VERB
how ADV
, PUNCT
how ADV
, PUNCT
how ADV
to PART
proceed VERB
using VERB
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
precisely ADV
what PRON
we PRON
’re VERB
supposed VERB
to PART
do AUX
and CCONJ
that DET
’s VERB
the DET
theme NOUN
of ADP
this DET
chapter NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
part NOUN
how ADV
to PART
write VERB
this DET
function NOUN
actually ADV
depends VERB
on ADP
the DET
domain NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
that DET
’s VERB
the DET
reason NOUN
why ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
not PART
going VERB
to PART
discuss VERB
much ADJ
about ADP
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
know VERB
how ADV
to PART
and CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
some DET
books NOUN
available ADJ
on ADP
how ADV
to PART
write VERB
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
for ADP
a DET
given VERB
domain NOUN
like SCONJ
chess NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
we PRON
can VERB
choose VERB
the DET
book NOUN
that DET
suits VERB
your DET
domain NOUN
, PUNCT
look VERB
for ADP
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
or CCONJ
try VERB
writing VERB
for ADP
yourself PRON
but CCONJ
otherwise ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
know VERB
how ADV
to PART
write VERB
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
whatever DET
we PRON
’re VERB
going VERB
to PART
talk VERB
about ADP
is AUX
perfectly ADV
all ADV
right ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Even ADV
if SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
know VERB
it PRON
’s VERB
still ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
’ll VERB
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
first ADJ
method NOUN
and CCONJ
that DET
method NOUN
is AUX
again ADV
pretty ADV
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
I PRON
do AUX
is AUX
I PRON
’m VERB
here ADV
in ADP
this DET
state NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
just ADV
apply VERB
one NUM
rule NOUN
that DET
is AUX
possible ADJ
to PART
be AUX
applied VERB
in ADP
this DET
generate NOUN
the DET
node NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
this DET
node NOUN
is AUX
better ADJ
than SCONJ
this DET
I PRON
’ll VERB
just ADV
go VERB
, PUNCT
that DET
’s VERB
called VERB
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
called VERB
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
’m VERB
actually ADV
incrementing VERB
the DET
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
my DET
current ADJ
node NOUN
’s PART
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
is AUX
three NUM
, PUNCT
I PRON
get VERB
a DET
node NOUN
with ADP
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
five NUM
I PRON
just ADV
move VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
then ADV
from ADP
five NUM
I PRON
get VERB
seven NUM
, PUNCT
I PRON
move VERB
, PUNCT
a DET
seven NUM
, PUNCT
eight NUM
I PRON
can VERB
move VERB
up ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
my DET
requirement NOUN
is AUX
to PART
reach VERB
to ADP
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
’ve VERB
already ADV
told VERB
you PRON
ten NOUN
is AUX
the DET
solution NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so SCONJ
that DET
’s VERB
why ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
called VERB
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
algorithm NOUN
is AUX
shown VERB
on ADP
the DET
screen NOUN
, PUNCT
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
start NOUN
and CCONJ
make VERB
it PRON
current ADJ
node ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
start NOUN
node ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
’s VERB
the DET
current ADJ

if SCONJ
it PRON
’s VERB
the DET
goal NOUN
, PUNCT
great ADJ
, PUNCT
you PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
need VERB
to PART
do AUX
anything PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
not PART
fine ADJ
, PUNCT
go VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Look VERB
at ADP
all DET
possible ADJ
rules NOUN
to PART
be AUX
applied VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Apply VERB
the DET
first ADJ
rule NOUN
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
better ADV
go VERB
to ADP
that DET
node ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Generate VERB
new ADJ
state NOUN
by ADP
applying VERB
next ADJ
rule NOUN
, PUNCT
no DET
rule NOUN
is AUX
left VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
have AUX

this DET
particular ADJ

there PRON
are AUX
no DET
rules NOUN
possible ADJ
you PRON
ca VERB
n’t PART
go VERB
further ADV
is AUX
a DET
dead ADJ
end NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Say VERB
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
not PART
move VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Apply VERB
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
, PUNCT
see VERB
which DET
one NOUN
is AUX
better ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
better ADV
go VERB
ahead ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
this DET
example NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
figure NOUN
actually ADV
talks VERB
about ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’d VERB
begin VERB
with ADP
a DET
state NOUN
with ADP
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
minus NOUN
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
apply VERB
for ADP
a DET
stool NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
get VERB
minus ADV
five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Can VERB
we PRON
move VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
can VERB
not PART
because SCONJ
this DET
particular ADJ
node NOUN
has AUX
lesser ADJ
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’d VERB
like VERB
to PART
have AUX
a DET
better ADV
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
so SCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB
not PART
move VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Next ADJ
one NUM
is AUX
minus CCONJ
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
also ADV
is AUX
not PART
very ADV
good ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
is AUX
not PART
better ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
current ADJ
one NOUN
so SCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB
not PART
move VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Zero PROPN
is AUX
better ADJ
than SCONJ
minus ADV
three NUM
so ADV
we PRON
’ll VERB
pick VERB
up ADP
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
the DET
first ADJ
node NOUN
that DET
we PRON
generate VERB
is AUX
minus ADV
one NUM
, PUNCT
which DET
is AUX
obviously ADV
not PART
as ADV
good ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
the DET
other ADJ
one NOUN
when ADV
you PRON
apply VERB
the DET
second ADJ
rule NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
state NOUN
that DET
we PRON
get VERB
has AUX
value NOUN
two NUM
so ADV
we PRON
move VERB
to ADP
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
we PRON
apply VERB
the DET
first ADJ
rule NOUN
which DET
makes VERB
it PRON
four NUM
so ADV
this DET
state NOUN
is AUX
good ADJ
so SCONJ
we PRON
move VERB
to ADP
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
we PRON
have AUX
two NUM
options NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
is AUX
four NUM
, PUNCT
which DET
is AUX
same ADJ
so SCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB
not PART
go VERB
for ADP
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
Next ADJ
one NUM
is AUX
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
what PRON
we PRON
do AUX
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’ll VERB
jump VERB
to ADP
ten NUM
and CCONJ
we PRON
got VERB
a DET
solution NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
is AUX
called VERB
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Sounds VERB
simple ADJ
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
problem NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Look VERB
at ADP
this DET
typical ADJ
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’d VERB
start VERB
with ADP
minus ADV
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
node NOUN
is AUX
minus ADV
five NUM
, PUNCT
not PART
very ADV
good ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
have AUX
zero NUM
this DET
is AUX
better ADJ
so SCONJ
we PRON
move VERB
there ADV
then ADV
minus VERB
one NOUN
not PART
good ADJ
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
better ADJ
, PUNCT
go VERB
there ADV
, PUNCT
four NUM
, PUNCT
we PRON
’re VERB
moving VERB
along ADP
quite ADV
nice ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
problem NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
two NUM
children NOUN
neither DET
of ADP
them PRON
has AUX
better ADJ
value NOUN
and CCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
stuck ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’re VERB
stuck ADJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
can VERB
not PART
move VERB
forward ADV
and CCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
not PART
at ADP
the DET
solution NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
when ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
at ADP
the DET
solution NOUN
when ADV
we PRON
get VERB
value NOUN
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
have AUX
the DET
value NOUN
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
get VERB
three NUM
and CCONJ
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
none NOUN
of ADP
them PRON
is AUX
a DET
solution NOUN
but CCONJ
we PRON
can VERB
not PART
go VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
the DET
problem NOUN
with ADP
hill NOUN
climbing VERB
that SCONJ
’s VERB
called VERB
local ADJ
maxima PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
called VERB
local ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
not PART
reached VERB
to ADP
the DET
final ADJ
goal NOUN
state NOUN
that DET
’s VERB
a DET
local ADJ
surrounding NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
maximum ADJ
is AUX
it PRON
is AUX
three NUM
and CCONJ
two NUM
are AUX
lesser ADJ
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
you PRON
’re VERB
doing VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
’re VERB
actually ADV
you PRON
start VERB
with ADP
minus ADV
three NUM
then ADV
zero NUM
then ADV
two NUM
then ADV
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
’d VERB
reach VERB
to ADP
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
you PRON
ca VERB
n’t PART
move VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
actually ADV
mini ADJ
maxima PROPN
, PUNCT
it PRON
’s VERB
kind ADV
of ADV
a DET
hill NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
reached VERB
to ADP
four NUM
you PRON
ca VERB
n’t PART
move VERB
further ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
that DET
is AUX
called VERB
local ADJ
maxima PROPN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
something PRON
called VERB
dead ADJ
end VERB
also ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
look VERB
at ADP
this DET
example NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Same ADJ
three NUM
, PUNCT
zero NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
four NUM
, PUNCT
four NUM
and CCONJ
six NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
choose VERB
six NUM
but CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
are AUX
no DET
rules NOUN
possible ADJ
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
very ADV
good ADJ
rule NOUN
six NUM
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
it PRON
’s VERB
not PART
solution NOUN
but CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
are AUX
no DET
possible ADJ
rules NOUN
to PART
be AUX
applied VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
there PRON
are AUX
no DET
possibility NOUN
of ADP
applying VERB
any DET
rules NOUN
we PRON
ca VERB
n’t PART
move VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
six NUM
is AUX
a DET
dead ADJ
end NOUN
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
something PRON
called VERB
steepest PROPN
ascent PROPN
hill PROPN
climbing NOUN
which DET
is AUX
a DET
little ADJ
different ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
does AUX
it PRON
do AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
Instead ADV
of ADP
picking VERB
up ADP
one NUM
rule NOUN
and CCONJ
find VERB
out ADP
if SCONJ
the DET
node NOUN
is AUX
better ADJ
, PUNCT
what PRON
it PRON
does AUX
it PRON
explores VERB
everyone PRON
and CCONJ
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
see VERB
the DET
example NOUN
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
five NUM
, PUNCT
four NUM
and CCONJ
zero NUM
for ADP
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
four NUM
, PUNCT
again ADV
, PUNCT
pick VERB
up ADP
all DET
children NOUN
are AUX
four NUM
, PUNCT
five NUM
, PUNCT
six NUM
and CCONJ
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
six NUM
which DET
is AUX
best ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
what PRON
we PRON
’re VERB
doing VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’re VERB
picking VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
child NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
then ADV
eight NUM
and CCONJ
then ADV
ten NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
what PRON
is AUX
known VERB
as SCONJ
steepest PROPN
ascent PROPN
hill PROPN
climbing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
it PRON
is AUX
called VERB
steepest PROPN
ascent NOUN
because SCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
looking VERB
at ADP
all DET
possible ADJ
nodes NOUN
and CCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
node NOUN
which DET
gives VERB
us PRON
steepest NOUN
ascent NOUN
, PUNCT
will VERB
give VERB
us PRON
highest ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
the DET
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
the DET
children NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
we PRON
’ll VERB
choose VERB
the DET
child NOUN
with ADP
highest ADJ
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
that DET
’s VERB
why ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
called VERB
steepest PROPN
ascent NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
next ADJ
search NOUN
method NOUN
that DET
we PRON
’re VERB
going VERB

use VERB
, PUNCT
we PRON
’re VERB
going VERB

talk VERB
about ADP
is AUX
called VERB
best ADV
first ADJ
search NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET
is AUX
little ADV
different ADJ
than SCONJ
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
, PUNCT
a DET
little ADJ
better ADJ
than SCONJ
hill NOUN
climbing VERB
in ADP
some DET
sense NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’ve VERB
seen VERB
that SCONJ
we PRON
entangled VERB
into ADP
local ADJ
maxima PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
we PRON
find VERB
that SCONJ
on ADP
a DET
children NOUN
do AUX
n’t PART
have AUX
the DET
value NOUN
better ADV

us PRON
, PUNCT
what PRON
should VERB
we PRON
do AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
Hill NOUN
climbing VERB
stops VERB
there ADV
, PUNCT
right INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
fails VERB
there ADV
and CCONJ
in ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
best ADJ
first ADJ
search NOUN
we PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
do AUX
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
allows VERB
you PRON
to PART
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
child NOUN
, PUNCT
not PART
only ADV
that DET
irrespective ADV
of ADP
the DET
parents NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
like SCONJ
the DET
previous ADJ
case NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
four NUM
which DET
has AUX
two NUM
and CCONJ
three NUM
and CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
not PART
go VERB
because SCONJ
it PRON
’s VERB
worst ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
best ADV
first ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
even ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Not PART
only ADV
that DET
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
even ADV
go VERB
ahead ADV
and CCONJ
pick VERB
up ADP
some DET
other ADJ
brands NOUN
, PUNCT
some DET
other ADJ
node NOUN
which DET
is AUX
better ADJ
than SCONJ
three NUM
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
do AUX
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
what PRON
best ADJ
first ADJ
search NOUN
is AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
best ADV
first ADJ
search NOUN
you PRON
have AUX
three NUM
different ADJ
types NOUN
of ADP

. PUNCT
----------------
First ADV
, PUNCT
which DET
are AUX
already ADV
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Second ADV
, PUNCT
which DET
are AUX
yet ADV
to PART
be AUX
explored VERB
and CCONJ
the DET
third ADJ
which DET
we PRON
’re VERB
considering VERB
right ADV
now ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
candidates NOUN
for ADP
that DET
thing NOUN
so ADV
they PRON
’re VERB
best ADV
actually ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
always ADV
looking VERB
at ADP
best ADJ
nodes NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that SCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
three NUM
one NUM
is AUX
listed VERB
on ADP
the DET
slide NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
we PRON
have AUX
is AUX
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
Pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
start NOUN
node ADV
and CCONJ
make VERB
it PRON
current ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
start NOUN
node ADV
and CCONJ
take VERB
up ADP
all DET

, PUNCT
pick VERB
and CCONJ
store VERB
them PRON
in ADP
the DET
heuristic ADJ
sorted ADJ
order NOUN
of ADP
heuristic ADJ
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
we PRON
have AUX
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
on ADP
the DET
top NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
not PART
looking VERB
at ADP
the DET
children NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’re VERB
looking VERB
at ADP
just ADV
all DET
nodes NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
explore VERB
the DET
top NOUN
when ADV
we PRON
get VERB
all DET
nodes NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
apply VERB
heuristic ADJ
values NOUN
to ADP
them PRON
, PUNCT
add VERB
them PRON
in ADP
the DET
array NOUN
and CCONJ
again ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
that SCONJ
node ADV
from ADP
the DET
top NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
All DET
explored VERB
nodes NOUN
are AUX
kept VERB
in ADP
the DET
other ADJ
area NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
maybe ADV
surprised VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
only ADV
picking VERB
up ADP
unexplored ADJ
node ADV
what PRON
’s VERB
the DET
point NOUN
in ADP
storing VERB
explored VERB
nodes NOUN
, PUNCT
quite ADV
interesting ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
they PRON
’re VERB
needed VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Whenever ADV
you PRON
explore VERB
a DET
node NOUN
, PUNCT
whenever ADV
you PRON
generate VERB
children NOUN
for ADP
a DET
node NOUN
what PRON
if SCONJ
the DET
child NOUN
is AUX
already ADV
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’ve VERB
seen VERB
the DET
earlier ADJ
cases NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
repeated VERB
nodes NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
nodes NOUN
which DET
are AUX
already ADV
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
look VERB
at ADP
that DET
array NOUN
you PRON
can VERB
easily ADV
understand VERB
the DET
children NOUN
that DET
you PRON
’re VERB
generating VERB
is AUX
already ADV
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
add VERB
them PRON
in ADP
the DET
explored ADJ
array NOUN
and CCONJ
that DET
’s VERB
why ADV
the DET
reason NOUN
we PRON
’re VERB
keeping VERB
that DET
array NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
how ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
doing VERB
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
beginning NOUN
you PRON
just ADV
insert ADV
all DET
nodes NOUN
in ADP
an DET
array NOUN
and CCONJ
other ADJ
unexplored ADJ
node NOUN
in ADP
the DET
other ADJ
array NOUN
and CCONJ
find VERB
out ADP
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
from ADP
the DET
array NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
the DET
array NOUN
is AUX
empty ADJ
they PRON
report VERB
failure NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
the DET
array NOUN
becomes VERB
empty ADJ
because SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
node NOUN
to PART
explore VERB
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
impossible ADJ
in ADP
some DET
cases NOUN
but CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
possible ADJ
in ADP
some DET
cases NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
whenever ADV
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
node NOUN
to PART
explore VERB
you PRON
can VERB
not PART
go VERB
further ADV
and CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
end NOUN
, PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
this DET
thing NOUN
road NOUN
ahead ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
two NUM
important ADJ
characteristics NOUN
of ADP
best ADJ
first ADJ
search NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Best ADV
first ADV
, PUNCT
remember VERB
the DET
word NOUN
best ADV
first ADJ
means VERB
that SCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
only ADV
exploring VERB
best ADJ
nodes NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
obviously ADV
we PRON
need VERB
to PART
have AUX
unexplored ADJ
nodes NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
’ve VERB
already ADV
talked VERB
about ADP
the DET
need NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
other ADJ
one NOUN
which DET
is AUX
also ADV
quite ADV
interesting ADJ
is AUX
that SCONJ
we PRON
always ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
irrespective NOUN
of ADP
the DET
parent NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
unlike ADP
hill NOUN
climbing VERB
it PRON
does AUX
not PART
get AUX
stuck ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
tries VERB
all DET
possible ADJ
way NOUN
to PART
explore VERB
the DET
search NOUN
surface NOUN
and CCONJ
get AUX
the DET
solution NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
heuristic ADJ
search NOUN
process NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
search NOUN
process NOUN
that DET
is AUX
described VERB
earlier ADV
you PRON
move VERB
in ADP
this DET
direction NOUN
and CCONJ
this DET

and CCONJ
this DET
direction NOUN
you PRON
may VERB
feel VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
’s VERB
called VERB
jittery ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
moves VERB
to ADP
and CCONJ
fro VERB
and CCONJ
it PRON
’s VERB
not PART
going VERB
directly ADV
to ADP
the DET
solution NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
quite ADV
acceptable ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
if SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
– PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
have AUX
a DET
formula NOUN
which DET
can VERB
directly ADV
lead VERB
to ADP
a DET

then ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
not PART
an DET
AI PROPN
problem NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
a DET
formula NOUN
you PRON
just ADV
apply VERB
if SCONJ
the DET
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
gives VERB
you PRON
exact ADJ
measure NOUN
of ADP
how ADV

the DET
goal NOUN
node ADV

you PRON
do AUX
n’t PART
need VERB
to PART
do AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
no DET
search NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
exactly ADV
tells VERB
you PRON
the DET
value NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
most ADJ
cases NOUN
, PUNCT
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
will VERB
not PART
give VERB
you PRON
exact ADJ
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
just ADV
gives VERB
you PRON
an DET
estimate NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
and CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
some DET
mathematical ADJ
ways NOUN
of ADP
judging VERB
how ADV
estimate NOUN
is AUX
near ADJ
to ADP
the DET
correct ADJ
value NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
eventually ADV
what PRON
we PRON
get VERB
when ADV
we PRON
use VERB
heuristic ADJ
is AUX
the DET
estimate NOUN
of ADP
how ADV
far ADV
we PRON
are AUX
from ADP
the DET
goal NOUN
node NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
when ADV
we PRON
only ADV
have AUX
an DET
estimate NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
likely ADJ
that SCONJ
we PRON
try VERB
in ADP
one NUM
direction NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
may VERB
fail VERB
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
to PART
try VERB
in ADP
the DET
other ADJ
direction NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON
has AUX
to PART
be AUX
that DET
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
and CCONJ
I PRON
’ve VERB
already ADV
talked VERB
about ADP
the DET
chess NOUN
playing NOUN
programs NOUN
use VERB
serious ADJ
heuristics NOUN
and CCONJ
sometimes ADV
the DET
chess NOUN
playing NOUN
programs NOUN
use VERB
heuristics NOUN
based VERB
on ADP
the DET
opponent NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
Garry PROPN
Kasparov PROPN
, PUNCT
the DET
Deep ADJ
Blue ADJ

which DET
IBM PROPN

which DET

three NUM

two NUM
if SCONJ
you PRON
remember VERB
that DET

it PRON
was AUX
there ADV
in ADP
news NOUN
for ADP
quite DET
some DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON
could VERB
do AUX
it PRON
because SCONJ
the DET

use VERB
heuristics NOUN
based VERB

the DET
Garry PROPN
Kasparov PROPN

And CCONJ
you PRON

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
have AUX
minus ADV
three NUM
, PUNCT
then ADV
minus CCONJ
five NUM
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
two NUM
and CCONJ
three NUM
are AUX
the DET
children NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
a DET

minus ADV
three NUM
, PUNCT
which DET

explored VERB
three NUM
, PUNCT
which DET

also ADV
explored VERB
now ADV
which DET

being AUX
explored VERB
right ADV
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Minus CCONJ
five NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
one NUM
and CCONJ
two NUM
are AUX
yet ADV
to PART
be AUX
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
they PRON
are AUX
part NOUN
of ADP
the DET
unexplored ADJ
nodes NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Minus CCONJ
three NUM
and CCONJ
two NUM
now ADV
they PRON
’re VERB
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
’re VERB
only ADV
taking VERB
a DET
small ADJ
segment NOUN
of ADP
this DET
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
now ADV
two NUM
is AUX
the DET
best ADJ
this DET
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
out SCONJ
of ADP
minus NOUN
five NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
one NOUN
and CCONJ
minus ADV
two NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
is AUX
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
See VERB
, PUNCT
we PRON
’re VERB
not PART
doing VERB
exploring VERB
it PRON
like SCONJ
hill NOUN
climbing NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
exploring VERB
like SCONJ
hill NOUN
climbing VERB
we PRON
’ve VERB
come VERB
to ADP
a DET
dead ADJ
end NOUN
actually ADV
because SCONJ
three NUM
only ADV
two NUM
children NOUN
minus CCONJ
one NOUN
and CCONJ
minus ADV
two NUM
both DET
of ADP
them PRON
are AUX
having VERB
less ADJ
value NOUN
so SCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB
not PART
be AUX
going VERB
forward ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
here ADV
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
, PUNCT
two NUM
is AUX
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
, PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON
’ll VERB
explore VERB
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
if SCONJ
two NUM
is AUX
explored VERB
we PRON
get VERB
minus ADV
three NUM
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
two NUM
and CCONJ
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
we PRON
’ll VERB
explore VERB
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
again ADV
different ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
hill NOUN
climbing VERB
because SCONJ
if SCONJ
this DET
where ADV
hill NOUN
climbing VERB
one PRON
can VERB
not PART
be AUX
explored VERB
it PRON
has AUX
lesser ADJ
value NOUN
than SCONJ
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
but CCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
doing VERB
it PRON
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
so ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
picking VERB
up ADP
, PUNCT
we PRON
’re VERB
taking VERB
that DET
as ADV
correct ADJ
and CCONJ
we PRON
’re VERB
going VERB
forward ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
we PRON
have AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
minus ADV
three NUM
and CCONJ
minus ADV
four NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
in ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
case NOUN
, PUNCT
minus CCONJ
three NUM
, PUNCT
two NUM
, PUNCT
one NUM
and CCONJ
three NUM
, PUNCT
all DET
four NUM
of ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Minus CCONJ
one NUM
is AUX
the DET
best ADJ

right ADV
now ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
we PRON
’re VERB
going VERB

it PRON
and CCONJ
so ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
this DET

jittery ADJ
obviously ADV

you PRON
the DET

let VERB
us PRON
look VERB

But CCONJ
when ADV

You PRON

For ADP
example NOUN

then ADV
there PRON

You PRON

Also ADV
in ADP
the DET

In ADP
the DET

usually ADV
you PRON

It PRON

quite ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ
you PRON

what PRON

It PRON

actually ADV
for ADP
example NOUN

that DET
it PRON

In ADP
next ADJ

all DET
hundred NUM

only ADV
first ADJ
five NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ

So ADV
in ADP
case NOUN

only ADJ
first ADJ

little ADJ
more ADV
dense ADJ

ninety NUM

really ADV

Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
look VERB

this DET

. PUNCT
----------------
A DET
chess NOUN

, PUNCT
you PRON

Now ADV
it PRON

actually ADV
possible ADJ

Moving VERB

you PRON

that DET
sixteen NUM
I PRON

just ADV

So CCONJ

I PRON

… PUNCT
I PRON

or CCONJ
for ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
there PRON

This DET

the DET

Six NUM

that SCONJ
there PRON

So ADV
what PRON

the DET

Saving NOUN

not PART
these DET

but CCONJ
then ADV

Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
for ADP
example NOUN
missionary ADJ

we PRON
've AUX

… PUNCT
I PRON
've AUX
already ADV
talked VERB

this DET

actually ADV

Take VERB
a DET

in ADP
the DET

, PUNCT
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Well INTJ
when ADV
we PRON
reach VERB

an DET
unreachable ADJ

unaccepted ADJ
… PUNCT
Now ADV
there PRON

two NUM

you PRON

there PRON

one NUM

when ADV
you PRON

you PRON
go VERB

a DET

you PRON

, PUNCT
remember VERB
missionary ADJ
cannibal NOUN
there PRON

some DET

which DET

. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
when ADV
number NOUN

less ADJ

number NOUN
of ADP
cannibals NOUN
you PRON
can VERB
not PART
accept VERB
that DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
reach VERB
to ADP
a DET
state NOUN
which DET
is AUX
not PART
acceptable ADJ
or CCONJ
when ADV
you PRON
reach VERB
to ADP
a DET
move NOUN
which DET

not PART
acceptable ADJ
because SCONJ
it PRON

impossible ADJ
using VERB
the DET
move NOUN
to PART
move VERB
from ADP
one NUM
… PUNCT
this DET
state NOUN
to ADP
this DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
in ADP
either DET
case NOUN
, PUNCT
this DET
particular ADJ
sequence NOUN
is AUX
not PART
useful ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
you PRON

is AUX
you PRON
can VERB
apply VERB
variable NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
neighborhood NOUN
descent NOUN
function NOUN

----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
use VERB
sparse NOUN
what PRON
you PRON

do AUX
is AUX
you PRON
can VERB
just ADV
replace VERB
it PRON

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Suppose VERB
example NOUN
there PRON
are AUX
ten NUM
moves NOUN
and CCONJ
you PRON
reach VERB
to ADP
seventh ADJ
move NOUN
which DET

not PART
accepted VERB
, PUNCT
so ADV
seven NUM
eight NUM
nine NUM
ten NUM
four NUM
moves NOUN
you PRON
can VERB
take VERB
all DET

of ADP
that DET
and CCONJ
try VERB

----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
one NUM

and CCONJ
then ADV
it PRON

quite ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ
you PRON
take VERB
the DET
entire ADJ

. PUNCT

It PRON

huge ADJ

So ADV
first ADJ
example NOUN
is AUX
comparatively ADV
sparse ADJ

the DET
second ADJ

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT

Why ADV
sparse ADJ

In ADP

We PRON

both DET

dead ADJ

So ADV
better ADJ

For ADP

So ADV
we PRON

we PRON

But CCONJ
when ADV

Okay INTJ

so CCONJ
when ADV

why ADV
it PRON

Now ADV
you PRON

Now ADV
why ADV

For ADP

somebody PRON

Now ADV

fact NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
are AUX
trying VERB
multiple ADJ
functions NOUN

when ADV
the DET
one NUM
function NOUN

not PART
yielding VERB
any DET
result NOUN
you PRON
start VERB
applying VERB
the DET
other ADJ
function NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
use VERB
one NUM
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN

example NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
use VERB
one NUM
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN

Now ADV

here ADV
you PRON

----------------
You PRON
ca VERB

So ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON
you PRON
do AUX
is AUX
you PRON
apply VERB
some DET
other ADJ

parent NOUN
say VERB
five NUM

but CCONJ
then ADV
two NUM
children NOUN
seven NUM
and CCONJ
nine NUM
then ADV
you PRON
can VERB
pick VERB

nine NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
one NUM
way NOUN

doing VERB
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
other ADJ
ways NOUN

----------------
Maybe ADV
one NUM

It PRON

Now ADV

this DET

an DET

Here ADV

----------------
From ADP
four NUM
you PRON

three NUM
also ADV

In ADP
a DET

And CCONJ
later ADV

So ADV
that DET

in ADP
the DET

Okay INTJ

----------------
A DET

about ADP
it PRON

very ADV

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
just ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
a DET

and CCONJ
see VERB
if SCONJ
it PRON

so ADV

in ADP
hill NOUN

you PRON
actually ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET

Okay INTJ

In ADP

in ADP
the DET

them PRON
in ADP
the DET

So ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
basically ADV
hill NOUN

but CCONJ
with ADP
little ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
escape VERB

, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
try VERB

understand VERB
the DET
two NUM
important ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
First ADV
, PUNCT
a DET
bad ADJ
move NOUN
is AUX
allowed VERB
with ADP
some DET

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
that DET
probably ADV

a DET
period NOUN

time NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
That SCONJ
probably ADV

not PART
remain VERB
the DET

----------------
In ADP
the DET
initial ADJ

bad ADJ

are AUX
allowed VERB
almost ADV
with ADP
equal ADJ

as SCONJ
of ADP
the DET
good ADJ

but CCONJ
later ADV

it PRON

almost ADV
zero NUM

----------------
Not PART
only ADV
that DET

it PRON

kind ADV
of ADV
keeping VERB
the DET
best ADJ
so ADV
far ADV
node ADV

well ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
're AUX
going VERB
down ADV
, PUNCT
down ADV
, PUNCT
down ADV
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
you PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON

quite ADV
possible ADJ
you PRON
allow VERB
a DET
bad ADJ

a DET
little ADJ
worse ADJ

but CCONJ
you PRON
still ADV

the DET

, PUNCT
so SCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
always ADV
go VERB
back ADV
to ADP
that DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
because SCONJ
we PRON
allow VERB
the DET
bad ADJ

you PRON
need VERB
to PART
have AUX
this DET
best ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
these DET
are AUX
two NUM
important ADJ
principles NOUN
of ADP

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
let VERB
us PRON
try VERB

understand VERB
the DET

which DET

… PUNCT
In ADP
metallurgy NOUN
when ADV

they PRON

  SPACE

manner NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
to PART
maximize VERB
the DET
crystal NOUN

solid ADJ
… PUNCT
this DET
thing NOUN
there PRON

something PRON

The DET

basically ADV
how ADV
you PRON

----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON

it PRON
fast ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON

do AUX
it PRON
in ADP
short ADJ
time NOUN
but CCONJ
unlike ADP
the DET
slow ADJ
that DET

… VERB
what PRON
you PRON
get VERB

a DET
high ADJ

which DET
you PRON

----------------
Slow ADJ

if SCONJ
you PRON

that DET

in ADP
a DET

the DET
problem NOUN

that SCONJ
it PRON

a DET
lot NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
that DET
obviously ADV

expensive ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON
you PRON
have AUX

do AUX
is AUX
to PART
reduce VERB
the DET

as ADV
fast ADV
as SCONJ
possible ADJ

the DET

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
that DET
actually ADV
there PRON

no DET

----------------
So ADV
what PRON
people NOUN
do AUX
it PRON

it PRON
empirically ADV

find VERB
… PUNCT
find VERB
out ADP
the DET

How ADV

Look VERB

Now ADV
you PRON

that SCONJ
what PRON

Now ADV

there PRON

Pick VERB
up ADP

Now ADV
what PRON

In ADP
in ADP
case NOUN

it PRON

----------------
If SCONJ

But CCONJ

----------------
We PRON

So ADV
this DET

Basically ADV

, PUNCT
okay INTJ

So ADV
temperature NOUN

When ADV

So ADV

How ADV

let VERB

Apply VERB

Now ADV
find VERB

Now ADV
here ADV
again ADV

If SCONJ

nothing PRON

Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON

Otherwise ADV

in ADP

Here ADV
we PRON

The DET

This DET

what PRON

Now ADV

we PRON

what PRON
we PRON

a DET
worse ADJ

okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX

calculate VERB
the DET

So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON
find VERB
out ADP
objective ADJ

a DET
new ADJ

minus CCONJ
the DET
objective ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET

a DET

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT

And CCONJ
calculate VERB
the DET

T NOUN

Delta PROPN

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
how ADV
come VERB
we PRON
have AUX
this DET

? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
it PRON

already ADV
there ADV
in ADP
the DET
original ADJ

that DET

And CCONJ
why ADV
it PRON

there PRON

… PUNCT
There PRON

some DET

it PRON

Maxwell PROPN

why ADV

There PRON
are AUX
some DET

about ADP
that DET

well ADV
which DET

not PART
part NOUN

our DET
this DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON
will VERB
not PART
be AUX
exploring VERB
that DET
here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
anyway INTJ
this DET
is AUX
the DET
equation NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
’ll VERB
calculate VERB
probability NOUN

one NUM

E NOUN

delta PROPN
E. PROPN
Delta PROPN
E PROPN
is AUX
a DET

and CCONJ
the DET
next ADJ
state NOUN
that SCONJ
we PRON

trying VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET

the DET
value NOUN
P NOUN
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
our DET
R NOUN
which DET

which DET
we PRON

randomly ADV

is AUX
less ADJ

P NOUN
, PUNCT
then ADV
we PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET
is AUX
basically ADV
moving VERB

that DET
state NOUN
with ADP
the DET
probability NOUN
P NOUN
because SCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON

a DET
good ADJ

one NUM
it PRON
is AUX
equally ADV
probable ADJ
each DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
choose VERB
say VERB
value NOUN
P NOUN
is AUX
point NOUN
three NUM
so SCONJ
the DET
probability NOUN

number NOUN

less ADJ

point NOUN
three NUM
is AUX
obviously ADV
point NOUN
three NUM
. PUNCT

So ADV
, PUNCT
with ADP
that DET

we PRON
are AUX
jumping VERB

otherwise ADV
not PART

they PRON
keep VERB

uh INTJ
hearing VERB
the DET

make VERB
sure ADJ
that SCONJ
there PRON

no DET
carnivorous ADJ
animals NOUN

And CCONJ
at ADP
the DET
first ADJ

One NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
ability NOUN

And CCONJ
obviously ADV
, PUNCT
only ADV
those DET

survive VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
carnivorous ADJ

also ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ

fast ADV
and CCONJ
they PRON
are AUX
better ADJ
uh INTJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
and CCONJ
in ADP
making VERB
sure ADJ
that SCONJ
the DET

get AUX
, PUNCT
the DET
, PUNCT
the DET
hint NOUN

, PUNCT
so-- PROPN
that SCONJ
they PRON
are AUX
on ADP
crawl NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
point NOUN
is AUX
the DET
only ADV
better ADJ

only ADV
better ADJ
individuals NOUN
are AUX
likely ADJ
to PART

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
the DET
second ADJ
principle NOUN
of ADP
GA PROPN
is AUX
that SCONJ
when ADV
better ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
this DET

GA PROPN
? PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
pretty ADV
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
GA PROPN
is AUX
about ADP
representing VERB
problems NOUN

----------------
So ADV
what PRON
you PRON
do AUX
is AUX
, PUNCT
you PRON
just ADV
get VERB
five NUM
best ADJ
solutions NOUN
and CCONJ
then ADV
, PUNCT
then ADV
mingle VERB
them PRON
in ADP
a DET
way NOUN
that DET
you PRON
get VERB
twenty NUM
better ADJ

and CCONJ
then ADV
again ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
five NUM
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
so ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
what PRON
GA PROPN
is AUX
all ADV
about ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
Let VERB
us PRON
begin VERB
talking VERB
about ADP
GA PROPN
. PUNCT
Let VERB
me PRON
talk VERB
that SCONJ
GA PROPN
is AUX
a DET
huge ADJ

and CCONJ
what PRON
I PRON

talk VERB
about ADP
is AUX
just ADV
I PRON
am AUX
just ADV
going VERB
to PART
scratch VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
are AUX
not PART
going VERB
to PART
discuss VERB
many ADJ

about ADP
GA PROPN
and CCONJ
I PRON
have AUX
given VERB
one NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
want VERB
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
are AUX
interested ADJ
in ADP
studying VERB
more ADJ
about ADP
GA PROPN
probably ADV
those DET

, PUNCT
[ PUNCT
Indiscernible][0:05:46 PROPN

in ADP
fact NOUN
there PRON
are AUX
many ADJ
, PUNCT
many ADJ
more ADJ

on ADP
GA PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Let VERB
us PRON
begin VERB
talking VERB
about ADP
this DET
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
As SCONJ
I PRON
said VERB
the DET
GA PROPN
is AUX
not PART
usual ADJ
content NOUN
for ADP
AI PROPN
this DET
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
something PRON
called VERB
Soft PROPN
Computing PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
lot NOUN
of ADP
– PUNCT
I PRON
do AUX
not PART
want VERB
to PART
again ADV
describe VERB
the DET
difference NOUN
between ADP
soft ADJ

and CCONJ
AI NOUN
because SCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
lot NOUN
of ADP
people NOUN
saying VERB
one NUM

, PUNCT
lot NOUN
of ADP
other ADJ
researchers NOUN
saying VERB
absolutely ADV
the DET
other ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
many ADJ
people NOUN
believe VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
GA PROPN
is AUX
not PART
part NOUN
of ADP
AI PROPN
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
part NOUN
of ADP
soft ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Anyway INTJ
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
talk VERB
about ADP
why ADV
it PRON
is AUX
an DET
excellent ADJ
method NOUN
of ADP
solving VERB
some DET
very ADV
, PUNCT
very ADV
interesting ADJ
AI PROPN
problems NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Well INTJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
will VERB
actually ADV
going VERB
to PART
see VERB
and CCONJ
find VERB
out ADP
how ADV
useful ADJ
it PRON
is AUX
for ADP
solving VERB
a DET
travelling VERB
salesman NOUN
problem NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
one NUM
great ADJ
thing NOUN
about ADP
GA PROPN
is AUX
that DET
can VERB
handle VERB
the DET
combinatorial ADJ
explosion NOUN
problem NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
it PRON
is AUX
doing VERB
we PRON
will VERB
see VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
is AUX
quite ADV
different ADJ
than SCONJ
other ADJ
algorithms NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
not PART
searching VERB
through ADP
the DET
search NOUN
spaces NOUN
, PUNCT
actually ADV
generate VERB
solutions NOUN
, PUNCT
in ADP
fact NOUN
generation NOUN
of ADP

the DET
other ADJ
and CCONJ
doing VERB
it PRON
in ADP
a DET
way NOUN
that DET
humans NOUN
and CCONJ
other ADJ

do AUX
in ADP
a DET
way NOUN
that DET
eventually ADV
what PRON
you PRON
get VERB
are AUX
better ADJ

search VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
after ADP
few ADJ
iterations NOUN
probably ADV
the DET
solutions NOUN
that DET
you PRON
have AUX
are AUX
better ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
earlier ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
based VERB
on ADP
the DET
idea NOUN
of ADP
how ADV
life NOUN
forms NOUN
persist VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
A DET
GA PROPN
obviously ADV
based VERB
on ADP
one NUM
simple ADJ
principle NOUN
which DET
Darwin PROPN
gave VERB
long ADV
back ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
survival NOUN
of ADP
the DET
fittest ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
, PUNCT
when ADV
any DET
spaces NOUN
have AUX

live VERB
and CCONJ
when ADV
the DET
condition NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
the DET
resources NOUN
are AUX
limited ADJ
they PRON
have AUX
to PART
fight VERB
for ADP
the DET
survival NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
all DET
the DET
capability NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
talked VERB
about ADP
deer NOUN
, PUNCT
even ADV
human ADJ
being NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
some DET
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
to PART
have AUX
some DET
qualities NOUN
to PART
survive VERB
and CCONJ
though SCONJ
we PRON
are AUX
better ADJ
quality NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
better ADJ
chances NOUN
of ADP
survival NOUN
and CCONJ
it PRON
inherits VERB
from ADP
parents NOUN
to ADP
children NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
so CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
something PRON
which DET
is AUX
very ADV
common ADJ
and CCONJ
seeing VERB
across ADP
all DET
live ADJ
firms NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
in ADP
– PUNCT
but CCONJ
then ADV
inheritance NOUN
involves VERB
lot NOUN
of ADP
randomness NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
five NUM
children NOUN
of ADP
the DET
same ADJ
parent NOUN
, PUNCT
same ADJ

are AUX
very ADV
different ADJ

each DET
other ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
They PRON
are AUX
quite ADV
different ADJ
from ADP
each DET
other ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
great ADJ

and CCONJ
the DET
same ADJ

we PRON
are AUX
going VERB

GA PROPN
, PUNCT
that DET

adopted VERB
in ADP
GA PROPN
to PART
solve VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
two NUM
important ADJ
principals NOUN
which DET
I PRON
have AUX
already ADV
talked VERB
about ADP
let VERB
me PRON
reiterate VERB
them PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
Better ADJ

and CCONJ
then ADV
next ADJ

genetically ADV
better ADJ
. PUNCT

In ADP
a DET

some DET
you PRON

so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
here ADV
usually ADV
a DET
simpler ADJ
method NOUN

we PRON
apply VERB

And CCONJ
then ADV
again ADV
you PRON
let VERB

So CCONJ
I PRON

And CCONJ
here ADV

an DET
example NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
start VERB

so SCONJ
you PRON

thirty NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT

And CCONJ
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
first ADJ
five NUM

so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
have AUX
already ADV

But CCONJ
the DET

How ADV
you PRON
combine VERB
two NUM

? PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET

one NUM
simple ADJ
method NOUN

the DET
first ADJ

So ADV
the DET
first ADJ

Now ADV
there PRON

For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
let VERB

----------------
That DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
if SCONJ
I PRON
just ADV

Now ADV
the DET

something PRON
A NOUN

F PROPN
and CCONJ
now ADV
it PRON

here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
I PRON
cut VERB

them PRON
what PRON

happen VERB
, PUNCT
I PRON

not PART
correct ADJ
and CCONJ
some DET

----------------
Single ADJ

not PART
possible ADJ
here ADV
. PUNCT

So CCONJ
let VERB
us PRON

Let VERB
us PRON
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
first ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Here ADV
why ADV
it PRON

crossover NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
the DET

then ADV
the DET

used VERB
in ADP
crossover NOUN
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
try VERB

see VERB
how ADV
it PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN

And CCONJ
I PRON

So ADV
the DET

one NUM
remember VERB
, PUNCT
it PRON

going VERB
to PART
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
part NOUN
from ADP
parent NOUN

G PROPN
, PUNCT
A DET
parent NOUN

Similarly ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
middle ADJ
part NOUN

----------------
Now ADV
the DET

two NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ

So ADV
now ADV
look VERB

D NOUN
, PUNCT
E NOUN
and CCONJ
that DET

what PRON
we PRON

----------------
So ADV
B PROPN

B NOUN
, PUNCT
B PROPN

G NOUN
and CCONJ
A NOUN
is AUX

E NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
just ADV
compare VERB
them PRON

Now ADV
how ADV

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON

now ADV
it PRON

so ADV
better ADV
try VERB

Now ADV
how ADV
it PRON

See VERB
the DET

Okay INTJ

Now ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
first ADJ

A. NOUN
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
parent NOUN
one NUM
, PUNCT
first ADJ

first ADJ
city NOUN

A DET
and CCONJ
the DET

E. PROPN
So ADV
I PRON

E NOUN
here ADV
in ADP
child NOUN
one NUM

place NOUN
number NOUN
one NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
let VERB
us PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
second ADJ
one NOUN
, PUNCT
G. PROPN
Now PROPN
G PROPN

be AUX
mapped VERB

D. PROPN
So PROPN
G PROPN
is AUX
replaced VERB
by ADP
D. PROPN
Okay PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
child NOUN

B NOUN
, PUNCT
G PROPN
, PUNCT
A DET

D. PROPN
The DET
next ADJ

see VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

replaced VERB
G PROPN
, PUNCT
D PROPN
is AUX
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
C PROPN
and CCONJ
F PROPN
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
they PRON
are AUX
not PART
part NOUN
of ADP
the DET

and CCONJ
that DET

why ADV
they PRON
will VERB
have AUX

be AUX
copied VERB
as SCONJ
it PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
once SCONJ
they PRON

copied VERB
as SCONJ
it PRON

, PUNCT
you PRON
have AUX
complete ADJ
child NOUN
A. NOUN

B NOUN
, PUNCT
E NOUN
, PUNCT
A PROPN
, PUNCT
F PROPN
and CCONJ
D PROPN
okay INTJ

----------------
So CCONJ
this DET

the DET
partially ADV
mapped VERB
crossover NOUN
method NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
see VERB
as SCONJ
if SCONJ
I PRON

that SCONJ
they PRON

directly ADV
copied VERB
because SCONJ
there PRON

, PUNCT
they PRON

not PART
part NOUN
of ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
some DET
other ADJ

you PRON
probably ADV
have AUX
different ADJ

and CCONJ
you PRON

it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
in ADP
some DET
cases NOUN
the DET

is AUX
you PRON
will VERB
have AUX

cycle VERB
that DET
mapping NOUN
in ADP
fact NOUN
if SCONJ
you PRON
map VERB
the DET
first ADJ

is AUX
already ADV

then ADV
you PRON
have AUX

again ADV
map VERB
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
it PRON

sometimes ADV
in ADP
some DET
cases NOUN
it PRON

pretty ADV
complex ADJ
but CCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
taken VERB
a DET
very ADV

very ADV
simple ADJ
case NOUN
here ADV

just ADV
make VERB
you PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
have AUX
already ADV
told VERB
you PRON
in ADP
the DET
beginning NOUN
that SCONJ
GA PROPN

quite ADV
complex ADJ
so SCONJ
everything PRON
that DET
we PRON

talking VERB
right ADV
now ADV
is AUX
basically ADV
the DET
simplest ADJ

that DET
we PRON

but CCONJ
in ADP
true ADJ
sense NOUN
it PRON

it PRON
may VERB

pretty ADV
complex ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
other ADJ
one NUM

called VERB
Order PROPN
crossover NOUN

----------------
The DET
order NOUN
crossover NOUN
is AUX
very ADV
similar ADJ
to ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ

the DET
other ADJ

that DET
we PRON

going VERB

keep VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
it PRON
is AUX
done VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
Again ADV
let VERB
us PRON
see VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
parent NOUN
one NOUN
is AUX
A NOUN
, PUNCT
C PROPN
, PUNCT
B NOUN
, PUNCT
D NOUN
, PUNCT
E PROPN
, PUNCT
F PROPN
, PUNCT
G PROPN
out SCONJ

that DET
we PRON

copy VERB
the DET
middle ADJ
three NUM
elements NOUN
B PROPN
, PUNCT
D NOUN
and CCONJ
E NOUN
in ADP
the DET
child NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET

B NOUN
, PUNCT
G NOUN
and CCONJ
A NOUN
there PRON

B NOUN
, PUNCT
G NOUN
and CCONJ
A NOUN
, PUNCT
they PRON

not PART

be AUX
copied VERB
into ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
know VERB
the DET
same ADJ
parent NOUN
, PUNCT
same ADJ
city NOUN
can VERB
not PART

revisited VERB
, PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON
are AUX
ignoring VERB
them PRON
, PUNCT
we PRON
are AUX
cutting VERB
them PRON
off ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
that DET
, PUNCT
that DET
makes VERB
the DET
other ADJ
elements NOUN
available ADJ

us PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
once SCONJ
they PRON
are AUX
available ADJ
to PART
use VERB
we PRON
are AUX
just ADV
coping VERB
them PRON
according VERB
to ADP
the DET
order NOUN
in ADP
which DET
they PRON
appear VERB
in ADP
parent NOUN
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
C PROPN
is AUX
the DET
first ADJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON
copy VERB
C PROPN
here ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
D PROPN
is AUX
next ADJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
we PRON
are AUX
copying VERB
next ADJ
D NOUN
here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
E PROPN
is AUX
next ADJ
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
copied VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
F PROPN
is AUX
also ADV
copied VERB
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
done VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
how ADV
you PRON
get VERB
the DET
child NOUN
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
may VERB
get AUX
the DET
child NOUN
two NUM
in ADP
a DET
similar ADJ
fashion NOUN
and CCONJ
we PRON
will VERB
have AUX
the DET
order NOUN
crossover NOUN
work NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
third ADJ
one NOUN
is AUX
called VERB
Cyclic PROPN
crossover NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Cyclic PROPN
crossover NOUN
is AUX
also ADV
quite ADV
simple ADJ
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
here ADV
we PRON

taking VERB
some DET
other ADJ
string NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
are AUX
not PART
taking VERB
the DET
earlier ADJ
string NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
a DET
reason NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
we PRON
use VERB
the DET
same ADJ

surprisingly ADV
both DET
children NOUN
comes VERB
out ADP
to PART
be AUX
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
may VERB
test VERB
it PRON
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
may VERB
try VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
the DET
reason NOUN
why ADV
I PRON
have AUX
chosen VERB
different ADJ
side NOUN

string NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON

A NOUN
, PUNCT
B PROPN

C NOUN
, PUNCT
D NOUN
, PUNCT
E PROPN
, PUNCT
F PROPN

I PRON
little ADV
longer ADV

littler VERB
different ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
cyclic ADJ
crossover NOUN
is AUX
little ADV
different ADJ
so SCONJ
I PRON
have AUX
chosen VERB
a DET
longer ADJ
to PART
make VERB
sure ADJ
you PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON
begins VERB

A. NOUN
----------------
It PRON
begins VERB
with ADP
the DET
first ADJ

, PUNCT
okay INTJ

----------------
I PRON
do AUX
not PART

any DET

right ADV
now ADV
I PRON

not PART
have AUX
anything PRON

----------------
I PRON
start VERB
with ADP
the DET
first ADJ

and CCONJ
put VERB
it PRON
there ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
in ADP
the DET
child NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
now ADV
what PRON
I PRON
do AUX

----------------
I PRON
just ADV
find VERB
out ADP
a DET

parent NOUN
two NUM
and CCONJ
find VERB
out ADP
the DET

so CCONJ
D PROPN

----------------
See VERB
I PRON

A DET

So ADV
you PRON
first ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
begin VERB
with ADP
A DET
now ADV
you PRON
D. PROPN
Now ADV
D PROPN

so CCONJ
the DET

H. PROPN
And CCONJ
H PROPN
appears VERB

position NOUN
the DET
last ADJ

so CCONJ
it PRON

copied VERB
there ADV
in ADP
the DET
child NOUN

You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
now ADV
H NOUN

number NOUN
three NUM
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
that DET

added VERB
okay INTJ
you PRON

; PUNCT
a DET
position NOUN
that DET
appears VERB

child NOUN
one NUM
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
see VERB
corresponding VERB
element NOUN

B NOUN
, PUNCT
so ADV
B NOUN

copied VERB
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that DET
B NOUN

next ADJ
three NUM

So CCONJ
we PRON

Now ADV
an DET

A. NOUN
----------------
Now ADV
A PROPN

already ADV
there PRON
so SCONJ
we PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
A DET
, PUNCT
we PRON

A DET
, PUNCT
now ADV
we PRON
reach VERB

A PROPN
and CCONJ
the DET

stop VERB
this DET
process NOUN
and CCONJ
copy VERB
the DET
rest NOUN

as SCONJ
it PRON

, PUNCT
so ADV
A DET
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
what PRON
I PRON
do AUX
, PUNCT
I PRON
just ADV
copy VERB
rest NOUN
as SCONJ
it PRON

and CCONJ
what PRON
I PRON
get VERB
is AUX
this DET
, PUNCT
this DET
four NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ

So CCONJ
this DET

what PRON
I PRON

A NOUN
so ADV
this DET

what PRON
I PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
some DET

once SCONJ
you PRON

you PRON
copy VERB

I PRON
just ADV

----------------
How ADV

----------------
You PRON

that DET
because SCONJ
you PRON

associative ADJ
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON

past NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
this DET
associative ADJ
search NOUN

also ADV
something PRON
where ADV
human ADJ

are AUX
far ADV
better ADV
compare NOUN

us PRON
, PUNCT
the DET
computers NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
As SCONJ
I PRON
said VERB
, PUNCT
researchers NOUN
try VERB

mimic VERB
brain NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
first ADJ
thing NOUN
that DET
they PRON
wanted VERB

do AUX
which DET
is AUX
to PART
have AUX
a DET
neuron NOUN
which DET
they PRON
call VERB
artificial ADJ
neuron NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
– PUNCT
the DET
many ADJ
researchers NOUN
they PRON
did AUX
many ADJ
develop VERB
many ADJ
artificial ADJ
neurons NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
are AUX
not PART
going VERB
to PART
discuss VERB
all DET

them PRON
we PRON
are AUX
just ADV
going VERB
to PART
talk VERB
about ADP
the DET
most ADV
preliminary ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
First ADV
of ADP
all DET
let VERB
us PRON
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
basic ADJ
brain NOUN
neuron NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Basis NOUN
brain NOUN
neuron NOUN
is AUX
roughly ADV
divided VERB
into ADP
three NUM
parts NOUN
, PUNCT
one NUM
is AUX
called VERB
Dendrites NOUN
which DET
is AUX
basically ADV
an DET
input NOUN
device NOUN
, PUNCT
something PRON
which DET
provides VERB
input NOUN
to ADP
the DET
cell NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
nucleus NOUN
of ADP
the DET
neuron NOUN
which DET
has AUX
a DET
long ADJ
cord NOUN
which DET
is AUX
called VERB
an DET
Axon PROPN
and CCONJ
which DET
again ADV
it PRON
is AUX
distributed VERB
in ADP
small ADJ
tiny ADJ
threads NOUN
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
this DET
Axon PROPN
is AUX
basically ADV
an DET
output NOUN
device NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
whenever ADV
an DET
electrochemical ADJ
signal NOUN
arrives VERB
at ADP
neuron PROPN
the DET
dendrites NOUN
will VERB
capture VERB
that SCONJ
, PUNCT
send VERB
that DET
thing NOUN
to ADP
the DET
nucleus NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
nucleus NOUN
process NOUN
is AUX
that DET
and CCONJ
then ADV
send VERB
it PRON
across ADV
over ADP
Axon PROPN
, PUNCT
Axon PROPN
connects VERB
itself PRON
to ADP
dendrites NOUN
of ADP
other ADJ
neurons NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
as SCONJ
said VERB
, PUNCT
such ADJ
connections NOUN
are AUX
plenty ADJ
, PUNCT
on ADP
an DET
average ADJ
one NUM
thousand NUM
connections NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
every DET
neuron NOUN
on ADP
an DET
average NOUN
is AUX
connected VERB
to ADP
one NUM
thousand NUM
of ADP
the DET
neuron NOUN
, PUNCT
a DET
huge ADJ
network NOUN
and CCONJ
highly ADV
connected ADJ
network NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
– PUNCT
the DET
artificial ADJ
neurons NOUN
also ADV
is AUX
designed VERB
exactly ADV
in ADP
that DET
fashion NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
next ADJ
slide NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
does AUX
this DET
artificial ADJ
neuron NOUN
do AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
nucleus NOUN
job NOUN
is AUX
done VERB
by ADP
a DET
function NOUN
called VERB
the DET
Sigma PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
sometimes ADV
other ADJ
function NOUN
used VERB
, PUNCT
you PRON
will VERB
be AUX
looking VERB
at ADP
few ADJ
other ADJ
functions NOUN
in ADP
due ADJ
course NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
this DET
Sigma PROPN
is AUX
basically ADV
summing VERB
up ADP
everybody PRON
that DET
comes VERB
in ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
remember VERB
brain NOUN
uses VERB
a DET
stimuli NOUN
information NOUN
that DET
is AUX
coming VERB
in ADP
+ CCONJ
weight NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
here ADV
also ADV
we PRON
have AUX
inputs NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
inputs NOUN
are AUX
x1 PROPN
to ADP
xn X
and CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
weights NOUN
, PUNCT
weights NOUN
are AUX
w1 PROPN
to ADP
wn PROPN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
sometimes ADV
an DET
additional ADJ
value NOUN
is AUX
provided VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
the DET
slide NOUN
you PRON
will VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
an DET
additional ADJ
value NOUN
one NUM
which DET
is AUX
provided VERB
w PROPN
one NUM
, PUNCT
w PROPN
two NUM
one NUM
, PUNCT
w PROPN
three NUM
one NUM
, PUNCT
w PROPN
n PROPN
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
maybe ADV
surprise VERB
what PRON
that DET
one NUM
is AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
is AUX
called VERB
layer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Many DET
a DET
time NOUN
the DET
neurons NOUN
appear VERB
in ADP
multiple ADJ
layers NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
this DET
value NOUN
describes VERB
weight NOUN
of ADP
which DET
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
so SCONJ
we PRON
will VERB
come VERB
across ADP
this DET
once ADV
again ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Some DET
authors NOUN
describe VERB
the DET
layer NOUN
at ADP
the DET
end NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Some DET
authors NOUN
describe VERB
the DET
layer NOUN
in ADP
the DET
beginning NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON
– PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
write VERB
this DET
thing NOUN
as SCONJ
w PROPN
one NUM
one NUM
, PUNCT
w PROPN
one NUM
two NUM
, PUNCT
w PROPN
one NUM
three NUM
and CCONJ
w PROPN
one NUM
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
is AUX
also ADV
is AUX
perfectly ADV
valid ADJ
because SCONJ
that DET
also ADV
is AUX
acceptable ADJ
, PUNCT
acceptable ADJ
in ADP
literature NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
sigma NOUN
does AUX
what PRON
, PUNCT
it PRON
just ADV
sums VERB
up ADP
things NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
every DET
line NOUN
has AUX
two NUM
components NOUN
, PUNCT
xi PROPN
and CCONJ
wi PROPN
, PUNCT
so ADV
it PRON
just ADV
multiply ADV
xi PROPN
wi PROPN
xi PROPN
wi PROPN
x1 PROPN
w1 PROPN
x2 PROPN
w2 PROPN
x3 PROPN
w3 PROPN
at ADP
this DET
point NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
I PRON
am AUX
not PART
bothered VERB
about ADP
layers NOUN
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
I PRON
am AUX
just ADV
writing VERB
it PRON
that DET
way NOUN
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
basically ADV
sigma VERB
xi PROPN
wi PROPN
where ADV
i PRON
ranges VERB
from ADP
one NUM
to ADP
n. PROPN
That DET
is AUX
the DET
first ADJ
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
the DET
row NOUN
the DET
next ADJ
one NOUN
the DET
row NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
row NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
basically ADV
a DET
function NOUN
which DET
checks VERB
for ADP
a DET
threshold NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
the DET
summation NOUN
is AUX
beyond ADP
the DET
threshold NOUN
value NOUN
a DET
typical ADJ
threshold NOUN
value NOUN
it PRON
outputs VERB
one NOUN
otherwise ADV
it PRON
output VERB
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
A DET
very ADV
simple ADJ
function NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
outputs VERB
zero NUM
or CCONJ
one NUM
based VERB
on ADP
the DET
total ADJ
summation NOUN
of ADP
wi PROPN
xi PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
wi PROPN
xi PRON
is AUX
going VERB
beyond ADP
a DET
point NOUN
you PRON
output VERB
one PRON
otherwise ADV
you PRON
output VERB
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
this DET
function NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
artificial ADJ
neuron NOUN
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

pretty ADV
simple ADJ
design NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
next ADJ
slide NOUN
talks VERB
about ADP
the DET
same ADJ

----------------
You PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
first ADJ

two NUM
k. NOUN
Now ADV
here ADV
k NOUN
again ADV
is AUX
a DET

which DET
I PRON
was AUX
talking VERB
about ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
K PROPN
also ADV
can VERB
be AUX
there ADV
in ADP
the DET
beginning NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
subscripts NOUN
that DET
we PRON
are AUX
using VERB
here ADV
one NUM

n. PROPN
The DET

is AUX
the DET

choice NOUN
, PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
fixed VERB
rule NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
interestingly ADV
when ADV
you PRON
start VERB
doing VERB
it PRON
this DET
way NOUN
there PRON
can VERB
be AUX
three NUM
different ADJ
types NOUN
of ADP
outputs NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
are AUX
those DET
types NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
thing NOUN
for ADP
an DET
input NOUN
, PUNCT
for ADP
example NOUN
I PRON
am AUX
taking VERB
a DET
very ADV
simple ADJ
case NOUN
of ADP
recognizing VERB
an DET
email NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
I PRON
do AUX
is AUX
I PRON
provide VERB
images NOUN
of ADP
five NUM
different ADJ
friends NOUN
of ADP
mine NOUN
and CCONJ
I PRON
want VERB
the DET
neural NOUN
this DET
neuron NOUN
to PART
learn VERB
to PART
classify VERB
them PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
I PRON
just ADV
provide VERB
those DET
images NOUN
as SCONJ
inputs NOUN
to ADP
my DET
neuron NOUN
and CCONJ
those DET
inputs NOUN
and CCONJ
I PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
some DET
random ADJ

, PUNCT
weights NOUN
are AUX
multiplied VERB
with ADP
the DET
inputs NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
summation NOUN
is AUX
generated VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
take VERB
a DET
simpler ADJ
case NOUN
of ADP
having VERB
just ADV
one NUM
friend NOUN
, PUNCT
so ADV
the DET
output NOUN
is AUX
whether SCONJ
is AUX
the DET
friends NOUN
image NOUN
or CCONJ
not PART
, PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON
will VERB
have AUX
only ADV
two NUM
different ADJ
types NOUN
of ADP
images NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Images NOUN
of ADP
the DET
friend NOUN
that SCONJ
we PRON
would VERB
like VERB
to PART
recognize VERB
and CCONJ
some DET
other ADJ
images NOUN
, PUNCT
only ADV
two NUM
things NOUN
, PUNCT
so SCONJ
that SCONJ
simplifies VERB
our DET
description NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
when ADV
this DET
happens VERB
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
quite ADV
possible ADJ
-- PUNCT
  SPACE
there PRON
are AUX
three NUM
possible ADJ
outcomes NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
outcome NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
I PRON
provide VERB
image NOUN
of ADP
the DET
friend NOUN
and CCONJ
it PRON
recognize VERB
it PRON
correctly ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
for ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
assume VERB
that SCONJ
for ADP
correct ADJ
emails NOUN
the DET
output NOUN
should VERB
be AUX
one NUM
and CCONJ
I PRON
get VERB
one NUM
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
that DET
means VERB
great ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
person NOUN
is AUX
recognized VERB
clearly ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
issues NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
I PRON
may VERB
provide VERB
the DET
image NOUN
of ADP
my DET
friend NOUN
but CCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
says VERB
he PRON
is AUX
not PART
. PUNCT
----------------
Image NOUN
of ADP
some DET
other ADJ
object NOUN
is AUX
provided VERB
and CCONJ
it PRON
says VERB
it PRON
is AUX
a DET
friend NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
here ADV
please INTJ
understand VERB
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
different ADJ
problems NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Both DET
of ADP
them PRON
are AUX
misclassification NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
case NOUN
number NOUN
one NUM
, PUNCT
we PRON
say VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
the DET
summation NOUN
is AUX
beyond ADP
greater ADJ

the DET
threshold NOUN
value NOUN
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
problem NOUN
okay INTJ
sorry INTJ
greater ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
threshold NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
friend NOUN
but CCONJ
we PRON
provide VERB
something PRON
else ADV
and CCONJ
still ADV
summation NOUN
is AUX
beyond ADP
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
called VERB
positive ADJ
misclassification NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
other ADJ
way NOUN
around ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
provide VERB
the DET
friends NOUN
image NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
summation NOUN
is AUX
less ADJ
than SCONJ
what PRON
is AUX
expected VERB
is AUX
called VERB
negative ADJ
misclassification NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
classification NOUN
can VERB
be AUX
only ADV
one NUM
, PUNCT
correct ADJ

, PUNCT
right ADJ

friends NOUN
non ADJ

non ADJ

friend ADJ
, PUNCT
great ADJ

----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
if SCONJ
you PRON
provide VERB
friends NOUN
image NOUN
you PRON
should VERB
say VERB
friend NOUN
and CCONJ
it PRON

the DET

We PRON
can VERB
say VERB
that SCONJ
this DET

, PUNCT
we PRON
call VERB
it PRON

so CCONJ
it PRON

take VERB
it PRON

We PRON
also ADV

x SYM
zero NUM
as SCONJ
one NUM
and CCONJ
w PROPN

then ADV
the DET

----------------
It PRON

so ADV
on ADV

then ADV
it PRON

us PRON
less ADJ

Now ADV
this DET

----------------
The DET
first ADJ

Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON

very ADV
simple ADJ

----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
draw VERB
a DET

just ADV
see VERB
that DET

The DET
next ADJ

Now ADV
that DET

little ADJ
different ADJ

that DET
you PRON
better ADV
see VERB
that SCONJ
yourself PRON
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
this DET

----------------
Physically ADV
the DET
square ADJ

why ADV
it PRON

Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET

sigmoid ADJ
function NOUN
which DET
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
drawn VERB
on ADP
the DET
second ADJ

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
one NOUN

Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON
have AUX
sigmoid ADJ
function NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
Square ADJ

It PRON
just ADV
sum VERB
things NOUN

It PRON
is AUX
also ADV

there PRON

Sigmoid NOUN
because SCONJ

continuous ADJ
it PRON

possible ADJ

very ADV
required VERB
, PUNCT
why ADV
it PRON

required VERB
, PUNCT
sorry ADJ
I PRON
can VERB
not PART
talk VERB
about ADP
right ADV
now ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
mathematical ADJ
background NOUN

some DET

Backpropagation NOUN
you PRON
probably ADV

But CCONJ
understand VERB
that SCONJ
this DET

a DET
very ADV

very ADV
critical ADJ
requirement NOUN
for ADP
a DET

Back ADJ

We PRON

that DET

in ADP
the DET
next ADJ

----------------
And CCONJ
interesting ADJ
thing NOUN
is AUX
if SCONJ
you PRON
look VERB

both DET

, PUNCT
if SCONJ

example NOUN
, PUNCT
for ADP
your DET

the DET

you PRON

----------------
Now ADV
is AUX
it PRON
a DET
good ADJ
thing NOUN
to PART

----------------
It PRON
is AUX
not PART
very ADV
good ADJ

----------------
Because SCONJ
if SCONJ
later ADV
the DET

change VERB
later ADV
this DET

become VERB
negative ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
we PRON
want VERB

we PRON
want VERB
much ADV
larger ADJ
value NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET

it PRON

zero NUM
in ADP
a DET

that DET
later ADV
on ADV
if SCONJ
some DET

so SCONJ
it PRON

able ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
need VERB

increase VERB
summation NOUN
even ADV

correct ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
here ADV
it PRON
is AUX
not PART
possible ADJ
in ADP
square NOUN

----------------
In ADP
sigmoid NOUN

continuously ADV
increase VERB
because SCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON

get AUX
one NUM
actually ADV
it PRON

sigmoid NOUN
will VERB
output VERB
value NOUN
between ADP
zero NUM

----------------
And CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
want VERB

get AUX
one NOUN
you PRON

have AUX
to PART
get AUX
the DET

positive ADJ
infinite NOUN
which DET

very ADV
hard ADJ

almost ADV
impossible ADJ

----------------
Similarly ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON

get AUX
zero NUM
you PRON
will VERB
have AUX
to PART
get AUX
negative ADJ
infinite NOUN
which DET

also ADV

so CCONJ
it PRON
continuous ADJ

even ADV
if SCONJ

that DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Most ADJ

the DET

what PRON

we PRON

, PUNCT
say VERB
that SCONJ

ninety NUM

nine NUM
point NOUN
nine NUM
we PRON

that DET

point VERB
one NOUN
then ADV
you PRON
accept VERB
that DET
thing NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Instead ADV
of ADP
zero NUM
we PRON
accept VERB
point NOUN
one NUM
instead ADV
of ADP
one NUM
, PUNCT
we PRON
accept VERB
point NOUN
nine NUM
just ADV

----------------
And CCONJ
it PRON

What PRON

I PRON
just ADV

But CCONJ
we PRON

So ADV
what PRON

we PRON

Remember VERB
the DET
idea NOUN

----------------
In ADP
case NOUN

case NOUN
what PRON

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
will VERB

reduce VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
not PART
change VERB

because SCONJ
that DET

, PUNCT
that DET

the DET

that DET

, PUNCT
you PRON

that DET

----------------
You PRON
can VERB
only ADV
change VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
again ADV
input NOUN

of ADP
two NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
Zero PROPN

one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Those DET
bits NOUN
are AUX
what PRON
zero NUM

one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
anything PRON

be AUX
zero NUM
, PUNCT
xi PROPN
wi PROPN
k PROPN

all DET
xi PROPN

value NOUN
is AUX
zero NUM
wi PROPN
does AUX
not PART
make VERB
any DET
contribution NOUN
to ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
we PRON
have AUX

do AUX
is AUX
wherever ADV
the DET
xi PROPN

non ADJ
- ADJ
zero NUM
one NUM
we PRON
have AUX

change VERB
the DET
value NOUN

w. NOUN
We PRON

because SCONJ
we PRON

reduce VERB
the DET
amount NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
the DET
answer NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
what PRON
we PRON
do AUX
is AUX
will VERB
reduce VERB
the DET
weights NOUN
of ADP
every DET
case NOUN
where ADV
xi PRON

non ADJ
- ADJ
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Hopefully ADV
the DET

will VERB
be AUX
less ADJ

zero NUM
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
, PUNCT
when ADV
you PRON

negative ADJ
misclassification NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
the DET

of ADP
your DET

and CCONJ
it PRON

not PART
saying VERB
yes INTJ
, PUNCT
then ADV
we PRON
will VERB
have AUX

increase VERB
the DET
amount NOUN
of ADP
summation NOUN
and CCONJ
again ADV
anything PRON
multiplied VERB
by ADP
zero NUM
is AUX
not PART

, PUNCT
so ADV
will VERB
only ADV
increase VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
we PRON
are AUX
increasing VERB
, PUNCT
we PRON
increase VERB
the DET
weights NOUN
associated VERB

all DET
non ADJ

zero ADJ

so ADV
that DET

what PRON
we PRON
are AUX
going VERB

process NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON

also ADV

, PUNCT
in ADP
case NOUN

sigmoid NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
square NOUN
it PRON

not PART
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
default NOUN
form NOUN

square NOUN
does AUX
not PART
actually ADV
do AUX
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
slope NOUN
of ADP
an DET
activation NOUN
function NOUN
also ADV
is AUX
an DET
important ADJ
thing NOUN
here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
see VERB
that SCONJ
slope NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
if SCONJ
you PRON
increase VERB
the DET

the DET

available ADJ
on ADP
the DET

axis ADV
, PUNCT
larger ADJ
the DET

more ADV
the DET

----------------
Look VERB
at ADP
the DET
sigmoid NOUN
function NOUN
you PRON

be AUX
able ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
take VERB
the DET

further ADV
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
the DET

more ADV
so ADV
will VERB
continue VERB
increasing VERB
you PRON

get AUX
a DET
better ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
the DET
slope NOUN

like SCONJ
this DET

if SCONJ

more ADV
steep ADJ
then ADV
the DET

little ADJ

in ADP
a DET

it PRON

the DET

So ADV
it PRON

----------------
What DET

that SCONJ
you PRON

if SCONJ
you PRON

all DET

Okay INTJ

Okay INTJ

----------------
Learning VERB

not PART

So ADV
but CCONJ
– PUNCT
you PRON

ask VERB
let VERB

it PRON

this DET
so SCONJ
it PRON

But CCONJ
you PRON

let VERB

People NOUN

it PRON

the DET
rough ADJ

that SCONJ
the DET

the DET

you PRON

more ADJ

okay ADJ

So ADV
more ADJ
number NOUN

Ideally ADV
the DET

it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
one NUM

daily NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’s VERB
a DET
huge ADJ
company NOUN
and CCONJ
a DET
lot NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
he PRON

program NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
every DET

coming VERB
in ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
will VERB
shortlist VERB
five NUM

look VERB
at ADP
only ADV
five NUM
hundred NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
neural ADJ

do AUX
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
the DET
other ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
algorithm NOUN
what PRON
you PRON
need VERB
is AUX
a DET
multi ADJ
- ADJ

neuron NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
multi ADJ
layer NOUN
neural ADJ
network NOUN
which DET
anyway ADV
, PUNCT
I PRON
discussed VERB
about ADP
that SCONJ
in ADP
the DET
previous ADJ

and CCONJ
we PRON
are AUX
going VERB
to PART
study VERB
that DET
thing NOUN
really ADV
more ADJ
detail NOUN
in ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
module NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Multi ADJ
layer NOUN
module NOUN
means VERB
that SCONJ
network NOUN
contains VERB
more ADJ
than SCONJ
one NUM
module NOUN
, PUNCT
more ADJ
than SCONJ
one NUM
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
usually ADV
, PUNCT
most ADJ
of ADP
the DET
neural ADJ
networks NOUN
use VERB
three NUM
layers NOUN
but CCONJ
the DET
recent ADJ
trend NOUN
is AUX
to PART
use VERB
many ADJ
, PUNCT
many ADJ
layers NOUN
, PUNCT
hundreds NOUN
of ADP
layers NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
algorithm NOUN
works VERB
like SCONJ
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
layer NOUN
one NUM
, PUNCT
layer VERB
two NUM
, PUNCT
layer VERB
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
inputs NOUN
come VERB
from ADP
this DET

and CCONJ
flows VERB
through ADP
this DET
layers NOUN
and CCONJ
then ADV
goes VERB
out ADP
the DET
last ADJ
layer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
inputs NOUN
flow NOUN
in ADP
the DET
forward ADJ
direction NOUN
and CCONJ
whenever ADV
the DET
input NOUN
flows VERB
, PUNCT
the DET
output NOUN
layer NOUN
checks VERB
whether SCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
is AUX
right ADJ
or CCONJ
wrong ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
if SCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
is AUX
wrong ADJ
, PUNCT
it PRON
floats VERB
those DET
errors NOUN
back ADV
and CCONJ
that DET
's AUX
why ADV
because SCONJ
of ADP
this DET
, PUNCT
the DET
algorithm NOUN
is AUX
known VERB
as SCONJ
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
propagates VERB
the DET
errors NOUN
back ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
the DET
errors NOUN
are AUX
propagated VERB
back ADP
, PUNCT
the DET
weights NOUN
are AUX
adjusted VERB
accordingly ADV
which DET
we PRON
discussed VERB
in ADP
a DET
previous ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON
are AUX
going VERB
to PART
study VERB
in ADP
little ADJ
more ADJ
detail NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
process NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
algorithm NOUN
which DET
does AUX
all DET
this DET
, PUNCT
the DET
algorithm NOUN
tells VERB
how ADV
you PRON
calculate VERB
the DET
hind NOUN
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
that DET
’s VERB
called VERB
activation NOUN
, PUNCT
how ADV
what PRON
… PUNCT
what PRON
flows VERB
from ADP
the DET
middle ADJ
layer NOUN
to ADP
the DET
final ADJ
layer NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
algorithm PROPN
decides VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
also ADV
calculates VERB
the DET
error NOUN
coming VERB
back ADV
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
algorithm NOUN
the DET
back ADJ
- PUNCT
probation NOUN
algorithm NOUN
is AUX
all ADV
about ADP
processing NOUN
like SCONJ
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
some DET
prerequisites NOUN
to ADP
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
prerequisite NOUN
is AUX
it PRON
works VERB
… PUNCT
In ADP
fact NOUN
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
is AUX
used VERB
in ADP
many ADJ
forms NOUN
in ADP
many ADJ
places NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
the DET
one NOUN
which DET
I PRON
'm AUX
talking VERB
about ADP
backpropagation NOUN
neural ADJ
network NOUN
the DET
BPNN PROPN
which DET
is AUX
the DET
most ADV
used VERB
algorithm NOUN
requires VERB
the DET
network NOUN
to PART
be AUX
complete ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
does AUX
that DET
mean VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
layer NOUN
connects VERB
to ADP
every DET
unit NOUN
of ADP
the DET
second ADJ
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
unit NOUN
or CCONJ
neuron NOUN
or CCONJ
number NOUN
of ADP
neurons NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
for ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
input NOUN
layer NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
five NUM
neurons NOUN
- PUNCT
one NUM
two NUM
three NUM
four NUM
five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Middle ADJ
layer NOUN
you PRON
also ADV
have AUX
say VERB
three NUM
neurons NOUN
one NUM
two NUM
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
first ADJ
neuron NOUN
here ADV
connects VERB
to ADP
first ADJ
second ADJ
and CCONJ
third ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Second ADJ
also ADV
connects VERB
to ADP
first ADJ
second ADJ
and CCONJ
third ADJ
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
means VERB
it PRON
has AUX
complete ADJ
connections NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Every DET
input NOUN
unit NOUN
or CCONJ
neuron NOUN
is AUX
connected VERB
to ADP
every DET
middle ADJ
unit NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
same ADJ
way NOUN
every DET
middle ADJ
unit NOUN
is AUX
connected VERB
to ADP
every DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
it PRON
has AUX
more ADJ
than SCONJ
one NUM
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
same ADJ
thing NOUN
is AUX
applied VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
called VERB
complete ADJ
network NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
's AUX
the DET
first ADJ
requirement NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
a DET
figure NOUN
nine NUM

one NUM
in ADP
the DET
handout NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
as SCONJ
in ADP
the DET
PPT NOUN
which DET
clearly ADV

what PRON
I PRON
just ADV
talked VERB
about ADP
and CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
called VERB
three NUM
three NUM
two NUM
network NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
can VERB
be AUX
any DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
here ADV
we PRON
have AUX
three NUM
inputs NOUN
, PUNCT
three NUM
hidden ADJ
or CCONJ
middle ADJ
layer NOUN
units NOUN
and CCONJ
two NUM
output NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
number NOUN
of ADP
inputs NOUN
and CCONJ
output NOUN
unit NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
are AUX
decided VERB
we PRON
’ll VERB
soon ADV
see VERB
but CCONJ
before ADP
which DET
let VERB
us PRON
try VERB
to PART
understand VERB
this DET
thing NOUN
, PUNCT
this DET
multi ADJ
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
feed VERB
forward ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
is AUX
called VERB
feed NOUN
forward ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
that DET
's AUX
the DET
other ADJ
word NOUN
which DET
is AUX
being AUX
used VERB
feed NOUN
forward ADV
means VERB
the DET
inputs NOUN
are AUX
flowing VERB
in ADP
the DET
forward ADJ
direction NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
it PRON
applies VERB
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
algorithm NOUN
for ADP
learning VERB
where ADV
the DET
errors NOUN
are AUX
propagated VERB
back ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
point NOUN
is AUX
inputs NOUN
are AUX
flowing VERB
in ADP
the DET
forward ADJ
direction NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
errors NOUN
are AUX
flowing VERB
in ADP
the DET
backward ADJ
direction NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
the DET
essence NOUN
that DET
’s VERB
why ADV
it PRON
is AUX
called VERB
feed NOUN
forward ADV
network NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
information NOUN
is AUX
coming VERB
in ADP
the DET
forward ADJ
direction NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
figure NOUN
clearly ADV
indicates VERB
how ADV
it PRON
is AUX
moving VERB
because SCONJ
it PRON
’s VERB
moving VERB
in ADP
the DET
direction NOUN
of ADP
the DET
arrow NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
also ADV
see VERB
that SCONJ
this DET
is AUX
a DET
complete ADJ
network NOUN
, PUNCT
every DET
input NOUN
unit NOUN
is AUX
connected VERB
to ADP
every DET
middle ADJ
unit NOUN
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
every DET
middle ADJ
unit NOUN
or CCONJ
hidden VERB
layer NOUN
unit NOUN
is AUX
connected VERB
to ADP
every DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
how ADV
it PRON
learns VERB
in ADP
fact NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
three NUM
examples NOUN
shown VERB
on ADP
the DET
screen NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’s VERB
a DET
nine NUM
into ADP
nine NUM
matrix NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
I'm NOUN
… PUNCT
I’m VERB
talking VERB
about ADP
a DET
very ADV
simple ADJ
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Nine NUM
into ADP
nine NUM
matrix NOUN
and CCONJ
I PRON
want VERB
to PART
recognize VERB
A. NOUN
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
a DET
very ADV
typical ADJ
problem NOUN
that DET
I PRON
've AUX
taken VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
could VERB
have AUX
been AUX
a DET
five NUM
hundred NUM

five NUM
hundred NUM
or CCONJ
five NUM
thousand NUM
into ADP
five NUM
thousand NUM
pixel NOUN
image NOUN
where ADV
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
signature NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Thus ADV
the DET
discussion NOUN
becomes VERB
a DET
little ADJ
more ADV
complex ADJ
but CCONJ
the DET
same ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
process NOUN
is AUX
the DET
same ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
this DET
case NOUN
we PRON
’ll VERB
have AUX
only ADV
eighty NUM
one NUM
, PUNCT
nine NUM
into ADP
nine NUM
is AUX
eighty NUM
one NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
that DET
case NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
five NUM
hundred NUM
into ADP
five NUM
hundred NUM
inputs NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
network NOUN
becomes VERB
little ADJ
big ADJ
pretty ADV
complex ADJ
but CCONJ
the DET
process NOUN
is AUX
going VERB
to PART
be AUX
the DET
same ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
this DET
three NUM
A PROPN

which DET
are AUX
shown VERB
here ADV
are AUX
quite ADV
different ADJ
to ADP
each DET
other ADJ
they PRON
are AUX
not PART
same ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
these DET
are AUX
the DET
A PROPN
's PART
which DET
are AUX
provided VERB
to ADP
the DET
system NOUN
and CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
some DET

the DET
… PUNCT
it PRON
’s VERB
pretty ADV
crude ADJ

but CCONJ
it PRON

still ADV
possible ADJ
for ADP
us PRON

how ADV
it PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

there PRON
are AUX
some DET

which DET
are AUX
on ADP
there PRON
are AUX

not PART
on ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
every DET

contains VERB
some DET
pixels NOUN
which DET
are AUX
black ADJ
some DET

which DET
are AUX
white ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Based VERB
on ADP
this DET
the DET

algorithm NOUN
and CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
an DET

----------------
Look VERB
at ADP
the DET
second ADJ
figure NOUN
and CCONJ
look VERB
at ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON

Now ADV
this DET

Now ADV
this DET

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
next ADJ

talks VERB
about ADP
this DET

in ADP
a DET
little ADJ

okay ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
every DET
A NOUN

----------------
Obviously ADV
I PRON

not PART
only ADV
A DET

----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
A DET

Z NOUN
that DET
means VERB
twenty NUM
six NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
I PRON

total ADJ
twenty NUM
six NUM

… PUNCT
I PRON

So ADV
what PRON
I PRON

thirty NUM
six NUM
or CCONJ
sixty NUM
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
many ADJ

----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
there PRON
are AUX
many ADJ

----------------
One NUM
very ADV
simple ADJ

use VERB
normal ADJ
way NOUN

If SCONJ
you PRON

that DET
for ADP
thirty NUM
… PUNCT
less ADJ

anything PRON
less ADJ

thirty NUM
two NUM
, PUNCT
five NUM
units NOUN

So ADV
two NUM

five NUM
you PRON

total ADJ
thirty NUM
two NUM

----------------
All DET
zeros NOUN
but CCONJ
the DET
last ADJ
one NOUN

B NOUN
and CCONJ
all DET
zero NUM
but CCONJ
the DET
fourth ADJ
one NOUN

C NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV

So ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON

that DET
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
more ADJ
you PRON

So CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
have AUX
six NUM

have AUX
total ADJ
sixty NUM
four NUM
possible ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
this DET

In ADP
this DET

So ADV
you PRON

near SCONJ
hundred NUM

So ADV
you PRON

----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON

not PART
even ADV
solve VERB
that DET

----------------
So SCONJ
people NOUN
started VERB
thinking VERB
that SCONJ
neural ADJ

solve VERB
this DET
problem NOUN
long ADV
, PUNCT
almost ADV
twenty NUM

somebody PRON

In ADP
fact NOUN

Now ADV
the DET
question NOUN

whether SCONJ

not PART
that DET

one NUM

but CCONJ
it PRON
also ADV

theoretically ADV
it PRON

possible ADJ
that SCONJ

----------------
It PRON

also ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ

fact NOUN
, PUNCT
empirically ADV
it PRON

… PUNCT
it PRON

But CCONJ
again ADV
theoretically ADV
if SCONJ
you PRON

a DET
proof NOUN
that SCONJ
the DET

surely ADV
solve VERB
that DET

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
was AUX
… PUNCT
possible ADJ
in ADP
the DET

But CCONJ
the DET
multi ADJ

version NOUN
you PRON

----------------
Fortunately ADV
for ADP
us PRON
the DET
empirical ADJ

So ADV
we PRON

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
there PRON

one NUM
more ADJ
thing NOUN
as SCONJ
I PRON
said VERB
that SCONJ
here ADV
we PRON

one NUM

----------------
You PRON
can VERB

multiple ADJ

also ADV
one NUM

, PUNCT
the DET
idea NOUN

We PRON

, PUNCT
for ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
capital NOUN
A PROPN

One NUM

we PRON

irrespective ADV

----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
if SCONJ
you PRON

do AUX
that DET

what PRON

the DET
advantage NOUN

----------------
The DET
advantage NOUN

if SCONJ

a DET

A. NOUN
----------------
So ADV
that DET
can VERB
generalize VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
beauty NOUN
of ADP
having VERB
a DET

is AUX
that SCONJ
it PRON

figure VERB
out ADP
the DET

those DET

, PUNCT
the DET

unit NOUN
can VERB
learn VERB

become VERB
active ADJ
or CCONJ

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
possible ADJ
to PART
have AUX
multiple ADJ

layers NOUN
and CCONJ
again ADV
the DET
theory NOUN
says VERB
that SCONJ

to PART
use VERB
a DET
single ADJ

So CCONJ
it PRON

it PRON

something PRON
which DET

good ADJ
enough ADV

----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
later ADV
on ADP
researchers NOUN

that SCONJ
if SCONJ

what PRON

And CCONJ
today NOUN

there PRON

The DET

In ADP

You PRON
may VERB

Because SCONJ

you PRON

If SCONJ

we PRON

So CCONJ
there PRON

So ADV
what PRON

----------------
When ADV
these DET
three NUM
lines NOUN
remain VERB
active ADJ
, PUNCT
these DET
three NUM
hidden VERB
units NOUN
become VERB
active ADJ
, PUNCT
the DET
unit NOUN
which DET
wants VERB

learn VERB
to PART
become VERB
active ADJ
and CCONJ
A DET
is AUX
presented VERB
will VERB
learn VERB
to PART
become VERB
active ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
that DET
's AUX
how ADV
it PRON
learns VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
third ADJ
unit NOUN
learns VERB
to PART
become VERB
active ADJ
and CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
the DET
other ADJ
line NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
figures NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
three NUM
figures NOUN
in ADP
the DET
handout NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
as SCONJ
the DET
PPT PROPN
clearly ADV
indicates VERB
this DET
part NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Let VERB
me PRON
recap VERB
this DET
… PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
part NOUN
is AUX
pretty ADV
important ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
have AUX
three NUM
units NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
learns VERB
to PART
become VERB
active ADJ
and CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
slanting VERB
line NOUN
moving VERB
from ADP
left ADV
to ADP
right NOUN
up ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
’s VERB
the DET
other ADJ
slanting ADJ
line NOUN
which DET
moves VERB
from ADP
left ADV
to ADP
right NOUN
down ADV
and CCONJ
the DET
other ADJ
one NOUN
which DET
is AUX
horizontal ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Every DET
unit NOUN
learns VERB
to PART
pick VERB
up ADP
this DET
feature NOUN
and CCONJ
learn VERB
to PART
become VERB
active ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
when ADV
there PRON
are AUX
many ADJ
other ADJ
cases NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
in ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
G NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
you PRON
also ADV
have AUX
here ADV
you PRON
have AUX
a DET
horizontal ADJ
line NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
issue NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
in ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
G NOUN
if SCONJ
in ADP
most ADV
handwritten ADJ
case NOUN
recognition NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
will VERB
not PART
find VERB
that SCONJ
horizontal ADJ
line NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
in ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
A NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
will VERB
almost ADV
invariably ADV
find VERB
them PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
these DET
are AUX
also ADV
points NOUN
that SCONJ
one PRON
must VERB
learn VERB
but CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
very ADV
interesting ADJ
how ADV
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
manages VERB
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
you PRON
're AUX
supposed VERB
to PART
do AUX
is AUX
to PART
provide VERB
some DET
images NOUN
of ADP
G NOUN
with ADP
and CCONJ
some DET
images NOUN
without ADP
that DET
horizontal ADJ
line NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
learns VERB
to ADP
… PUNCT
to PART
accept VERB
G NOUN
even ADV
without ADP
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON
’s VERB
very ADV
important ADJ
that SCONJ
you PRON
provide VERB
right ADJ
set NOUN
of ADP
samples NOUN
, PUNCT
right ADJ
set NOUN
of ADP
images NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
that DET
's AUX
why ADV
we PRON
have AUX
to PART
provide VERB
number NOUN
of ADP
images NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
more ADJ
numbers NOUN
you PRON
provide VERB
, PUNCT
in ADP
most ADJ
cases NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
better ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
limit NOUN
also ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
ca VERB
n't PART
, PUNCT
you PRON
should VERB
not PART
be AUX
going VERB
beyond ADP
that DET
limit NOUN
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
we PRON
'll VERB
be AUX
discussing VERB
about ADP
that DET
soon ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
look VERB
at ADP
this DET
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
network NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
network NOUN
is AUX
depicted VERB
here ADV
with ADP
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
dark ADJ
boldface NOUN
lines NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
weights NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
, PUNCT
now ADV
this DET
is AUX
only ADV
an DET
extension NOUN
to ADP
what PRON
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
in ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ
module NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
X0 PROPN
to ADP
XN PROPN
as SCONJ
an DET
input NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
the DET
N PROPN
value NOUN
depends VERB
on ADP
the DET
features NOUN
that DET
you PRON
take VERB
from ADP
the DET
input NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
already ADV
seen VERB
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
our DET
character NOUN
recognition NOUN
case NOUN
the DET
N PROPN
value NOUN
is AUX
eighty NUM
one NUM
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
you PRON
have AUX
the DET
middle ADJ
layer NOUN
in ADP
… PUNCT
remember VERB
middle ADJ
layer NOUN
you PRON
have AUX
to PART
total VERB
N PROPN
units NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
remember VERB
in ADP
our DET
previous ADJ
example NOUN
that SCONJ
we PRON
took VERB
M PROPN
value NOUN
is AUX
twenty NUM
- PUNCT
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
and CCONJ
you PRON
have AUX
output NOUN
units NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
our DET
case NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
've AUX
taken VERB
L. PROPN
So ADV
L NOUN
number NOUN
of ADP
output NOUN
units NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
is AUX
the DET
value NOUN
of ADP
N NOUN
in ADP
the DET
previous ADJ
example NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Twenty NUM
- PUNCT
six NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
only ADV
consider VERB
uppercase NOUN
, PUNCT
thirty NUM
- PUNCT
six NUM
uppercase NOUN
plus CCONJ
the DET
digits NOUN
and CCONJ
fifty NUM
- PUNCT
two NUM
when ADV
you PRON
consider VERB
upper ADJ
lowercase NOUN
and CCONJ
together ADV
and CCONJ
sixty NUM
- PUNCT
two NUM
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
upper ADJ
lower ADJ
case NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
as SCONJ
digits NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
we PRON
are AUX
considering VERB
L NOUN
to PART
be AUX
six NUM
, PUNCT
then ADV
all DET
three NUM
cases NOUN
are AUX
… PUNCT
are AUX
possible ADJ
to PART
be AUX
provided VERB
, PUNCT
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
use VERB
them PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
in ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
look NOUN
at ADP
the DET
weights NOUN
okay ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
those DET
weights NOUN
every DET
remember VERB
every DET
input NOUN
unit NOUN
is AUX
connected VERB
to ADP
every DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
weight NOUN
between ADP
X NOUN
zero NUM
and CCONJ
H NOUN
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
weight NOUN
between ADP
X PROPN
one NUM
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
remember VERB
the DET
X NOUN
zero NUM
and CCONJ
H NOUN
zero NUM
look NOUN
like SCONJ
inputs NOUN
but CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
arrow NOUN
going VERB
inside ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
They PRON
are AUX
not PART
inputs ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
X NOUN
zero NUM
and CCONJ
H PROPN
zero NUM
are AUX
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
remember VERB
W PROPN
zero PROPN
indicates VERB
threshold ADJ
, PUNCT
the DET
negative ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
threshold NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
at ADP
H NOUN
zero NUM
also ADV
indicate VERB
… PUNCT
the DET
W PROPN
zero NUM
in ADP
that DET
case NOUN
H PROPN
zero NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
second ADJ
layer NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
also ADV
it PRON
is AUX
the DET
negative ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
threshold NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
different ADJ
set NOUN
of ADP
weights NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
in ADP
other ADJ
words NOUN
there PRON
are AUX
three NUM
layers NOUN
of ADP
inputs NOUN
but CCONJ
two NUM
layers NOUN
of ADP
weights NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
first ADJ
layer NOUN
of ADP
weight NOUN
is AUX
called VERB
W PROPN
one NOUN
the DET
second ADJ
layer NOUN
of ADP
weight NOUN
is AUX
called VERB
W PROPN
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
first ADJ
layer NOUN
and CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
say VERB
W PROPN
one NUM
prefixes VERB
always ADV
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
… PUNCT
the DET
value NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
which DET

next ADP
the DET

, PUNCT
zero NUM
one NUM
that DET
value NOUN
indicates VERB
which DET
input NOUN
unit NOUN
to PART
which DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
W PROPN
one NUM
zero NUM
one NUM
means VERB
a DET
weight NOUN
between ADP
zeroth ADJ
input NOUN
unit NOUN
to ADP
first ADV
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
W NUM
two NUM
zero NUM
one NUM
means VERB
the DET
weight NOUN
between ADP
the DET
zeroth PROPN
or CCONJ
the DET
first ADJ
time NOUN
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
to ADP
the DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
one NOUN
, PUNCT
remember VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
… PUNCT
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
what PRON
the DET
indication NOUN
is AUX
and CCONJ
that DET
's AUX
how ADV
it PRON
is AUX
done VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
how ADV
it PRON
is AUX
summed VERB
up ADP
? PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
the DET
calculation NOUN
we PRON
requires VERB
everything PRON
every DET
the DET
sigma NOUN
that SCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
X PROPN
X NOUN
one NUM
W NOUN
one NUM
  SPACE
X NOUN
two NUM
W PROPN
two NUM
X NOUN
three NUM
W PROPN
three NUM
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
when ADV
you PRON
consider VERB
the DET
threshold NOUN
you PRON
also ADV
have AUX
X PROPN
zero NUM
W PROPN
zero NUM
where ADV
X NOUN
zero NUM
is AUX
basically ADV
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
summation NOUN
, PUNCT
suppose VERB
if SCONJ
I PRON
want VERB
to PART
calculate VERB
the DET
sum NOUN
that DET
is AUX
happening VERB
at ADP
H PROPN
… PUNCT
H NOUN
one NOUN
how ADV
it PRON
is AUX
calculated VERB
is AUX
shown VERB
in ADP
the DET
next ADJ
slide NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
can VERB
say VERB
that SCONJ
H NOUN
one NOUN
equal ADJ
to ADP
why ADV
is AUX
one NUM
because SCONJ
X PROPN
zero NUM
is AUX
always ADV
one NUM
into ADP
W PROPN
one NUM
zero NUM
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
W PROPN
plus CCONJ
now ADV
you PRON
talk VERB
about ADP
the DET
next ADJ
input NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
X DET
one NUM
into ADP
W PROPN
one NUM
one NUM
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
X NOUN
two NUM
into ADP
W PROPN
one NUM
two NUM
one NUM
X NOUN
three NUM
W PROPN
three NUM
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
on ADV
and CCONJ
till SCONJ
the DET
last ADJ
one NOUN
and CCONJ
remember VERB
total ADJ
values NOUN
are AUX
M PROPN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
the DET
last ADJ
one NOUN
is AUX
W PROPN
one PROPN
M PROPN
one NUM
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
at ADP
Ith PROPN
hidden ADJ
unit NOUN
it PRON
shows VERB
on ADP
the DET

the DET
only ADJ

is AUX
that SCONJ
it PRON

one NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
second ADJ

was AUX
one NUM
which DET
becomes VERB
I PRON
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
that DET
's AUX
the DET
only ADJ
difference NOUN
otherwise ADV
it PRON

the DET
same ADJ
okay NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET

calculated VERB
we PRON
have AUX
already ADV

----------------
We PRON
’ll VERB
use VERB
sigmoid ADJ

here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
one NUM

one NUM
plus CCONJ
E NOUN
raised VERB
to ADP
minus CCONJ
summation NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET

okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON

N. PROPN
Okay INTJ
the DET

total NOUN
N PROPN
inputs NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
N PROPN
inputs NOUN

So CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
0 NUM

N NUM
okay INTJ
and CCONJ
you PRON
… PUNCT
what PRON
you PRON
add VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
add VERB
  SPACE
XI PROPN
WI PROPN
  SPACE
ok INTJ
so SCONJ
those DET
XJ PROPN

okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
total ADJ

, PUNCT
we PRON
've AUX
already ADV
seen VERB
that SCONJ
how ADV
the DET

calculated VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM

one NUM
, PUNCT
plus CCONJ
E NOUN
raised VERB
to ADP
minus ADV
sum NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Those DET
XIs NOUN
and CCONJ
WIs NOUN
and CCONJ
all DET
that DET
they PRON
are AUX
they PRON
are AUX
multiplied VERB
and CCONJ
you PRON
get VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
okay INTJ
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
's AUX
how ADV
it PRON
is AUX
done VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
is AUX
the DET
first ADJ
thing NOUN
that DET
we PRON
've AUX
already ADV
seen VERB
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
we PRON
know VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
is AUX
a DET
real ADJ
value NOUN
between ADP
zero NUM
and CCONJ
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
required ADJ
value NOUN
is AUX
either CCONJ
zero NUM
or CCONJ
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
that DET
is AUX
the DET
first ADJ
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
need VERB
an DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
second ADJ
unit NOUN
to PART
be AUX
on ADV
and CCONJ
the DET
rest NOUN
of ADP
unit NOUN
to PART
be AUX
off ADV
and CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
six NUM
output NOUN
units NOUN
I PRON
… PUNCT
the DET
answer NOUN
that DET
I PRON
get VERB
is AUX
zero NUM
one NUM
zero NUM
zero NUM
zero NUM
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
second ADJ
unit NOUN
is AUX
one NUM
, PUNCT
The DET
rest NOUN
are AUX
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
what PRON
I PRON
want VERB
but CCONJ
I PRON
may VERB
because SCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
between ADP
zero NUM
and CCONJ
one NUM
I PRON
may VERB
get AUX
something PRON
like SCONJ
, PUNCT
zero NUM
point NOUN
one NUM
instead ADV
of ADP
zero NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
first ADJ
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
second ADJ
unit NOUN
one NUM
instead ADV
of ADP
that DET
I PRON
get VERB
point NOUN
ninety NUM
- PUNCT
eight NUM
and CCONJ
second ADJ
, PUNCT
third ADJ
one NUM
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
I PRON
get VERB
other ADJ
than SCONJ
zero NUM
as SCONJ
values NOUN
of ADP
output NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
how ADV
that DET
problem NOUN
can VERB
be AUX
solved VERB
or CCONJ
rather ADV
how ADV
to PART
handle VERB
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
's AUX
the DET
first ADJ
thing NOUN
that DET
we PRON
’ll VERB
discus VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
PowerPoint PROPN
looks VERB
… PUNCT
you PRON
better ADV
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
PowerPoint PROPN
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
says VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
actual ADJ
output NOUN
that SCONJ
you PRON
get VERB
is AUX
point NOUN
one NUM
, PUNCT
point NOUN
zero NUM
one NUM

seven NUM
when ADV
I PRON
actually ADV
want VERB
is AUX
zero NUM
zero NUM
zero NUM
zero NUM
one NUM
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
what PRON
you PRON
are AUX
supposed VERB
do AUX
is AUX
to PART
find VERB
… PUNCT
find VERB
out ADP
the DET
difference NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
what PRON
is AUX
the DET
difference NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Difference NOUN
basically ADV
is AUX
the DET
error NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
in ADP
the DET
absolute ADJ
form NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
what PRON
I PRON
want VERB
is AUX
one NUM
and CCONJ
what PRON
I PRON
get VERB
is AUX
point NOUN
five NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
error NOUN
is AUX
point NOUN
five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
that DET
's AUX
the DET
absolute ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
error NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
something PRON
called VERB
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
in ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
that SCONJ
in ADP
a DET
sigmoid ADJ
function NOUN
case NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
ca VERB
n't PART
have AUX
one NUM
… PUNCT
instead ADV
… PUNCT
unless SCONJ
you PRON
have AUX
the DET
total NOUN
to PART
be AUX
equal ADJ
to ADP
infinity NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
impossible ADJ
for ADP
you PRON
to PART
get AUX
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
’ll VERB
have AUX
to PART
have AUX
the DET
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
for ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
assumed VERB
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
to PART
be AUX
point NOUN
nine NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
what PRON
does AUX
that DET
mean VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
the DET
difference NOUN
between ADP
what PRON
is AUX
expected VERB
and CCONJ
what PRON
is AUX
outcome ADJ
is AUX
less ADJ
than SCONJ
point NOUN
ten NUM
, PUNCT
we PRON
accept VERB
it PRON
as SCONJ
valid ADJ
input NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
's AUX
the DET
second ADJ
point NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
what PRON
we PRON
discussed VERB
about ADP
expected VERB
values NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
values NOUN
that DET
we PRON
get VERB
between ADP
zero NUM
and CCONJ
one NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
third ADJ
one NOUN
is AUX
the DET
difference NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
the DET
fourth ADJ
thing NOUN
is AUX
the DET
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
the DET
difference NOUN
is AUX
less ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
accepted VERB
, PUNCT
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
unit NOUN
is AUX
not PART
required VERB
to PART
be AUX
learned VERB
further ADV
it PRON

… PUNCT
it PRON

said VERB
to PART
be AUX
learned VERB
and CCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
errors NOUN
are AUX
known VERB
as SCONJ
delta PROPN
two NUM
, PUNCT
conventionally ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
second ADJ
layer NOUN
weight NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
two NUM
layers NOUN
of ADP
weight NOUN
W PROPN
one PROPN
and CCONJ
W PROPN
two NUM
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
what PRON
we PRON
discussed VERB
about ADP
the DET
inputs ADJ
flow NOUN
in ADP
this DET
direction NOUN
the DET
errors NOUN
flow VERB
back ADV
? PUNCT
----------------
First ADV
of ADP
all DET
, PUNCT
the DET
errors NOUN
are AUX
available ADJ
at ADP
output NOUN
layer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
at ADP
output NOUN
layer NOUN
we PRON
… PUNCT
we PRON
look VERB
at ADP
what PRON
's AUX
the DET
actual ADJ
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
's AUX
the DET
expected VERB
value NOUN
and CCONJ
what PRON
's AUX
the DET
difference NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
actual ADJ
value NOUN
is AUX
OJ PROPN
and CCONJ
the DET
expected VERB
value NOUN
is AUX
YJ NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
the DET
difference NOUN
is AUX
YJ PROPN
minus NOUN
OJ NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
? PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
an DET
absolute ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
error NOUN
and CCONJ
we PRON
require VERB
to PART
normalize VERB
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
we PRON
multiply VERB
that DET
by ADP
OJ PROPN
into ADP
one NUM
minus NOUN
OJ NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
I PRON
'm AUX
doing VERB
it PRON
? PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
can VERB
not PART
explain VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
accept VERB
this DET
so SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
YJ PROPN
minus CCONJ
OJ PROPN
the DET
absolute ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
error NOUN
then ADV
you PRON
multiply VERB
it PRON
by ADP
OJ PROPN
into ADP
one NUM
minus NOUN
OJ NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
error NOUN
at ADP
HI PROPN
or CCONJ
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
is AUX
calculated VERB
in ADP
a DET
similar ADJ
fashion NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
does AUX
it PRON
do AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
call VERB
it PRON
delta VERB
one NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
error NOUN
at ADP
HI PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
an DET
error NOUN
coming VERB
in ADP
from ADP
an DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
to ADP
this DET
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
a DET
hidden ADJ
unit NOUN
contains VERB
errors NOUN
coming VERB
from ADP
all DET
output NOUN
units NOUN
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
basically ADV
, PUNCT
is AUX
the DET
… PUNCT
it PRON
calculates VERB
that SCONJ
this DET
way NOUN
so ADV
this DET
is AUX
the DET
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
this DET
is AUX
an DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
it PRON
says VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
error NOUN
at ADP
this DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
multiplied VERB
by ADP
this DET
weight NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
next ADJ
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
okay INTJ
… PUNCT
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
error NOUN
here ADV
and CCONJ
the DET
multiplied VERB
by ADP
weight NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
error NOUN
here ADV
and CCONJ
multiplied VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
in ADP
this DET
fashion NOUN
it PRON
calculates VERB
and CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
shown VERB
on ADP
the DET
screen NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
W PROPN

----------------
The DET
hidden ADJ

the DET

layer NOUN
one NUM
and CCONJ
error NOUN
at ADP
one NOUN
that DET

propagated VERB
back ADV
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
Same ADJ
way NOUN
error NOUN
at ADP
O NOUN
two NUM
and CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
W PROPN
two NUM
one NUM
two NUM
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
's AUX
how ADV
it PRON
calculates VERB
w PROPN
one NUM
three NUM
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
calculates VERB
that DET
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
way NOUN
you PRON
calculate VERB
the DET
error NOUN
rate NOUN
the DET
hidden VERB
layer NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
next ADJ
slide NOUN
shows VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
it PRON
’s VERB
sigma VERB
I PRON
equal ADJ
to ADP
one NUM

M PROPN
, PUNCT
because SCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
total ADJ
M PROPN
output NOUN
… PUNCT
the DET
hidden VERB
units NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
W PROPN
two NUM
one NUM
J PROPN
multiplied VERB
by ADP
delta NOUN
two NUM
J. PROPN
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
the DET
error NOUN
at ADP
the DET
HI PROPN
Ith PROPN
hidden ADJ
unit NOUN
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
how ADV
it PRON
is AUX
shown VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Look VERB
at ADP
two NUM

the DET
first ADJ

unit NOUN
and CCONJ

for ADP
it PRON
Ith PROPN

----------------
And CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

H PROPN

H NOUN
one NUM
or CCONJ
HI PROPN
into ADP

HI PROPN
that DET
is AUX
for ADP
normalizing VERB
the DET

, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
… PUNCT
the DET
absolute ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
error NOUN
is AUX
normalized VERB
by ADP
multiplying VERB
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET

is AUX
also ADV
the DET
same ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
hidden ADJ
unit NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET

, PUNCT
the DET

weight NOUN
, PUNCT
their DET

and CCONJ
those DET

are AUX
summed VERB
up ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
when ADV
we PRON
are AUX
looking VERB
at ADP
this DET
remember NOUN
we PRON
had AUX
a DET
problem NOUN
of ADP
negative ADJ
and CCONJ
positive ADJ
misclassification NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
negative ADJ
misclassification NOUN
you PRON
will VERB
have AUX
to PART
increase VERB
weights NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Positive ADJ
misclassification NOUN
you PRON
’ll VERB
have AUX

reduce VERB
weights NOUN
and CCONJ
that DET

you PRON
have AUX
to PART
calculate VERB
weights NOUN
that DET
way NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Interestingly ADV
, PUNCT
OJ PROPN
into ADP
one NUM
minus NOUN
OJ PROPN
or CCONJ
HJ PROPN
into ADP
one NUM
minus CCONJ
HJ PROPN
is AUX
always ADV
negative ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
, PUNCT
one NUM
of ADP
them PRON
is AUX
positive ADJ
, PUNCT
the DET
other ADJ
one NOUN
will VERB
become VERB
negative ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
that DET
's AUX
always ADV
negative ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
one NUM
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
error NOUN
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
just ADV
add VERB
that DET
thing NOUN
, PUNCT
multiply ADV
that DET
thing NOUN
it PRON
negates VERB
everything PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
YJ PROPN
is AUX
more ADJ
than SCONJ
OJ PROPN
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
YJ PROPN
minus CCONJ
OJ PROPN
is AUX
positive ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
you PRON
multiply VERB
with ADP
OJ PROPN
and CCONJ
one NUM
minus NOUN
OJ PROPN
, PUNCT
it PRON
becomes VERB
negative ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
negative ADJ
, PUNCT
IJ PROPN
is AUX
less ADJ
than SCONJ
OJ PROPN
, PUNCT
the DET
multiplication NOUN
the DET
value NOUN
becomes VERB
positive ADJ
so SCONJ
error NOUN
is AUX
high ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
just ADV
add VERB
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
need VERB
to PART
process VERB
it PRON
further ADV
you PRON
'll VERB
just ADV
add VERB
that SCONJ
because SCONJ
the DET

is AUX
taken VERB
care NOUN
of ADP
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
W PROPN
two NUM
one NUM

based VERB
on ADP
H PROPN
one NOUN

If SCONJ
you PRON
want VERB

update VERB
this DET
weight NOUN
W PROPN

That DET

so ADV
we PRON

first ADJ

You PRON

that SCONJ

geometric ADJ

Sometimes ADV
the DET

little ADJ

the DET

unit NOUN

Okay INTJ

So CCONJ
, PUNCT
as SCONJ
I PRON
said VERB

this DET
all DET
empirical ADJ
people NOUN

the DET

people NOUN

us PRON
who PRON

And CCONJ
now ADV
you PRON
randomly ADV

both DET

sometimes ADV
even ADV

zero NUM
five NUM

Now ADV
why ADV
we PRON

keeping VERB
this DET

very ADV

----------------
It PRON

because SCONJ

very ADV

value NOUN

But CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
keep VERB
some DET

the DET

that SCONJ
those DET

----------------
So ADV
network NOUN

not PART
only ADV

those DET

drive VERB
a DET

in ADP
something PRON

what PRON
we PRON

So ADV
the DET
good ADJ

the DET

the DET

that DET

we PRON

so CCONJ

And CCONJ
now ADV
you PRON

the DET
first ADJ
input NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
that DET
input NOUN
obviously ADV
, PUNCT
all DET
I PRON
values VERB
you PRON
just ADV
provide VERB
to ADP
XIs NOUN
and CCONJ
you PRON
let VERB
the DET
HI PROPN

calculated VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
know VERB
how ADV
it PRON

calculated VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
OJ PROPN
are AUX
also ADV
calculated VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Find VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
? PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
you PRON
find VERB
errors NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
will VERB
have AUX
to PART
get AUX
correct ADJ
value NOUN
for ADP
output NOUN
units NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
they PRON
are AUX
called VERB
YJs PROPN
, PUNCT
so CCONJ
, PUNCT
get AUX
YJs NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Find VERB
delta NOUN
two NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
error NOUN
at ADP
output NOUN
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Find VERB
delta NOUN
one NUM
, PUNCT
the DET
error NOUN
at ADP
the DET
hidden VERB
unit NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
this DET
weight NOUN
is AUX
to PART
be AUX
learned VERB
, PUNCT
please INTJ
understand VERB
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
correctly ADV
identifying VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
want VERB
that DET
output NOUN
unit NOUN
to PART
have AUX
value NOUN
one NUM
and CCONJ
it PRON
gets VERB
me PRON
point VERB
ninety NUM
eight NUM
and CCONJ
my DET

point NOUN
one NOUN
so ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
fine ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
anything PRON
beyond ADP
point NOUN
nine NUM
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
acceptable ADJ
to ADP
me PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
unit NOUN
does AUX
not PART
require VERB
to PART
learn VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
I PRON
will VERB
not PART
do AUX
anything PRON
here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
point NOUN
six NUM
or CCONJ
point NOUN
seven NUM
or CCONJ
point NOUN
eight NUM
or CCONJ
point NOUN
eighty NUM
five NUM
, PUNCT
I PRON
know VERB
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
difference NOUN
which DET
I PRON
want VERB
to PART
bridge VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
in ADP
that DET
case NOUN
this DET
process NOUN
is AUX
applied VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
weight NOUN
is AUX
updated VERB
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
weight NOUN
update NOUN
process NOUN
which DET
also ADV
uses VERB
eta PROPN
as ADV
well ADV
as SCONJ
alpha NOUN
, PUNCT
as SCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
before ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
once SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
that DET
, PUNCT
now ADV
first ADV
of ADP
all DET
you PRON
decide VERB
that SCONJ
W PROPN
two NUM
IJ PROPN
and CCONJ
then ADV
W PROPN
one NUM
IJ PROPN
and CCONJ
then ADV
update VERB
the DET
weight NOUN
by ADP
old ADJ
weight NOUN
plus CCONJ
this DET
delta NOUN
okay INTJ
and CCONJ
old ADJ
weight NOUN
plus CCONJ
alpha NOUN
into ADP
  SPACE
delta NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
, PUNCT
which DET
we PRON
have AUX
already ADV
seen VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
I PRON
'm AUX
not PART
going VERB
to PART
stress VERB
it PRON
further ADV
here ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET
is AUX
something PRON
to PART
be AUX
done VERB
for ADP
a DET
single ADJ
input NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Once SCONJ
this DET
input NOUN
is AUX
done VERB
, PUNCT
you PRON
’ll VERB
try VERB
the DET
next ADJ
input NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
next ADJ
and CCONJ
the DET
next ADJ
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
till SCONJ
all DET
inputs NOUN
are AUX
done VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
all DET
inputs NOUN
are AUX
done VERB
, PUNCT
the DET
weights NOUN
are AUX
updated VERB
, PUNCT
one NUM
e NOUN
poch NOUN
is AUX
said VERB
to PART
be AUX
over ADP
so SCONJ
the DET
epoch NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
incremented VERB
by ADP
one NUM
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
all DET
units NOUN
have AUX
learned VERB
everything PRON
you PRON
stop VERB
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
not PART
, PUNCT
you PRON
start VERB
the DET
with ADP
the DET
next ADJ
epoch PROPN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
you PRON
go VERB
back ADV
to ADP
the DET
place NOUN
and CCONJ
restart NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
the DET
algorithm NOUN
have AUX
to PART
restart VERB
from ADP
that DET
place NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Again ADV
take VERB
the DET
first ADJ
input NOUN
, PUNCT
second ADJ
input NOUN
, PUNCT
third ADJ
input NOUN
, PUNCT
update NOUN
weights NOUN
, PUNCT
update NOUN
weights NOUN
, PUNCT
update NOUN
weights NOUN
and CCONJ
at ADP
the DET
end NOUN
, PUNCT
again ADV
it PRON
finds VERB
that DET
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
unit NOUN
which DET
is AUX
not PART
learned VERB
and CCONJ
will VERB
again ADV
restart VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
will VERB
continue VERB
till SCONJ
all DET
units NOUN
are AUX
learned VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
means VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
expected VERB
value NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
value NOUN
that DET
you PRON
get VERB
the DET
difference NOUN
between ADP
them PRON
is AUX
less ADJ
than SCONJ
the DET
tolerance NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
all DET
units NOUN
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
the DET
case NOUN
the DET
neural ADJ
network NOUN
is AUX
said VERB
to PART
have AUX
learned VERB
what PRON
we PRON
wanted VERB
it PRON
to ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
once ADV
that DET
is AUX
done VERB
, PUNCT
what PRON
we PRON
do AUX
is AUX
we PRON
store VERB
this DET
weight NOUN
W PROPN
one NUM
IJ PROPN
is AUX
basically ADV
a DET
matrix NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
W PROPN
two NUM
IJ PROPN
is AUX
also ADV
a DET
matrix NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
this DET
matrix NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
stored VERB
somewhere ADV
, PUNCT
why ADV
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
whenever ADV
we PRON
are AUX
testing VERB
this DET
neural ADJ
network NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
’ll VERB
provide VERB
this DET
information NOUN
now ADV
we PRON
are AUX
not PART
going VERB
to PART
change VERB
this DET
weight NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
just ADV
let VERB
it PRON
flow VERB
and CCONJ
we PRON
'll VERB
see VERB
what PRON
the DET
output NOUN
is AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
called VERB
testing NOUN
now ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
testing NOUN
also ADV
you PRON
need VERB
an DET
algorithm NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
how ADV
the DET
algorithm NOUN
the DET
handout NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
PPT PROPN
contains VERB
that DET
algorithm NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
algorithm NOUN
begins VERB
with ADP
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
same ADJ
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
neural ADJ
network NOUN
setup NOUN
is AUX
provided VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
instead ADV
of ADP
providing VERB
random ADJ
weight NOUN
values NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
just ADV
populate VERB
it PRON
by ADP
the DET
weight NOUN
matrix NOUN
that DET
we PRON
already ADV
have AUX
stored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
provide VERB
the DET
first ADJ
testing NOUN
input NOUN
let VERB
it PRON
flow VERB
and CCONJ
the DET
output NOUN
is AUX
generated VERB
, PUNCT
that DET
output NOUN
is AUX
recorded VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Output NOUN
is AUX
not PART
… PUNCT
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
flow VERB
the DET
errors NOUN
back ADV
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
do AUX
anything PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
just ADV
note VERB
the DET
output NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
quite ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ
you PRON
test VERB
the DET
input NOUN
for ADP
twenty NUM
test NOUN
cases NOUN
and CCONJ
out SCONJ
of ADP
that DET
eighteen NUM
you PRON
get VERB
the DET
correct ADJ
answer NOUN
two NUM
you PRON
may VERB
not PART
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
is AUX
perfectly ADV
acceptable ADJ
, PUNCT
you PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON
happens VERB
and CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
common ADJ
also ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’s VERB
the DET
same ADJ
way NOUN
with ADP
child NOUN
when ADV
you PRON
provide VERB
child NOUN
with ADP
some DET
examples NOUN
of ADP
A DET
and CCONJ
some DET
examples NOUN
of ADP
B NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
some DET
time NOUN
he PRON
mistakes VERB
I PRON
for ADP
H PROPN
and CCONJ
H PROPN
for ADP
I PRON
it PRON
is AUX
possible ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
common ADJ
that DET
is AUX
like SCONJ
human ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
what PRON
is AUX
done VERB
usually ADV
the DET
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
or CCONJ
testing NOUN
is AUX
much ADV
, PUNCT
much ADV
higher ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
in ADP
most ADJ
cases NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
point NOUN
five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
more ADJ
than SCONJ
point NOUN
five NUM
it PRON
is AUX
considered VERB
to PART
be AUX
one NUM
less ADJ
than SCONJ
point NOUN
five NUM
it PRON
is AUX
considered VERB
to PART
be AUX
zero NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
tolerance NOUN
level NOUN
is AUX
high ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
has AUX
to PART
be AUX
high ADJ
because SCONJ
program NOUN
has AUX
not PART
seen VERB
this DET
input NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
actually ADV
this DET
learning NOUN
process NOUN
is AUX
doing VERB
it PRON
? PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
's AUX
the DET
mathematical ADJ
view NOUN
of ADP
it PRON
? PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
want VERB
to PART
understand VERB
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
assume VERB
that SCONJ
we PRON
only ADV
have AUX
a DET
two NUM
- PUNCT
dimensional ADJ
space NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
, PUNCT
we PRON
need VERB
an DET
n PROPN
dimensional ADJ
space NOUN
if SCONJ
we PRON
are AUX
using VERB
N PROPN
weights NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
a DET
figure NOUN
in ADP
the DET
handout NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
as SCONJ
the DET
PPT NOUN
which DET
talks VERB
about ADP
a DET
two NUM
- PUNCT
dimensional ADJ
space NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
a DET
two NUM
- PUNCT
dimensional ADJ
space NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
multiple ADJ
regions NOUN
defining VERB
a DET
class NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
we PRON
want VERB
to PART
do AUX
is AUX
to PART
have AUX
a DET
… PUNCT
and CCONJ
we PRON
take VERB
a DET
very ADV
simple ADJ
case NOUN
where ADV
there PRON
are AUX
only ADV
two NUM
types NOUN
of ADP
inputs NOUN
A PROPN
and CCONJ
not PART
A NOUN
for ADP
example NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
what PRON
we PRON
want VERB
is AUX
to PART
have AUX
a DET
line NOUN
which DET
separates VERB
them PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
line NOUN
will VERB
have AUX
some DET
slope NOUN
and CCONJ
a DET
C NOUN
value NOUN
you PRON
know VERB
why ADV
is AUX
equal ADJ
to ADP
MX PROPN
plus CCONJ
C PROPN
is AUX
the DET
equation NOUN
of ADP
line NOUN
M PROPN
and CCONJ
C PROPN
are AUX
constants NOUN
and CCONJ
they PRON
are AUX
decided VERB
by ADP
this DET
weights NOUN
that DET
we PRON
provide VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
when ADV
we PRON
start VERB
with ADP
random ADJ
weights NOUN
… PUNCT
random ADJ
weights NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
line NOUN
actually ADV
is AUX
drawn VERB
in ADP
a DET
random ADJ
way NOUN
on ADP
… PUNCT
on ADP
that DET
plane NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
when ADV
we PRON
continuously ADV
update VERB
that SCONJ
, PUNCT
basically ADV
you PRON
… PUNCT
you PRON
get VERB
a DET
line NOUN
which DET
separates VERB
what PRON
we PRON
want VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
A NOUN
and CCONJ
not PART
A DET
can VERB
be AUX
separated VERB
if SCONJ
you PRON
have AUX
A DET
B PROPN
C. PROPN
What PRON
we PRON
need VERB
is AUX
there PRON
are AUX
multiple ADJ
classes NOUN
, PUNCT
so SCONJ
we PRON
need VERB
multiple ADJ
lines NOUN
and CCONJ
for ADP
that DET
we PRON
need VERB
multiple ADJ
neurons NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
once SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
that DET
, PUNCT
once SCONJ
the DET
lines NOUN
are AUX
properly ADV
drawn VERB
, PUNCT
the DET
figure NOUN
actually ADV
talks VERB
about ADP
a DET
case NOUN
where ADV
there PRON
are AUX
one NUM
two NUM
three NUM
four NUM
, PUNCT
four NUM
lines NOUN
which DET

drawn VERB
in ADP
a DET
way NOUN
that SCONJ
it PRON
can VERB
separate VERB
one NUM
two NUM
three NUM
four NUM
five NUM
different ADJ
classes NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
get VERB
those DET
lines NOUN
right ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
will VERB
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART

, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
basically ADV
the DET
learning NOUN
process NOUN
is AUX
moving VERB
of ADP
that DET
line NOUN
to ADP
its DET
right ADJ
position NOUN
which DET
… PUNCT
which DET

a DET

. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
line NOUN
is AUX
known VERB
as SCONJ
decision NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
if SCONJ
in ADP
a DET
two NUM
dimensional ADJ
space NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
’s VERB
going VERB
to PART
be AUX
a DET
line NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
a DET
three NUM
dimensional ADJ
case NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
’s VERB
going VERB
to PART
be AUX
a DET
plane NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
can VERB
be AUX
n ADJ
dimensional ADJ
plane NOUN
you PRON
have AUX
an DET
n ADJ
minus CCONJ
one NUM
dimensional ADJ
decision NOUN
surface NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
that DET
decision NOUN
surface NOUN
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
learning NOUN
process NOUN
is AUX
basically ADV
to PART
start VERB
with ADP
a DET

surface NOUN
and CCONJ
come VERB
to ADP
the DET
right ADJ
or CCONJ
correct ADJ
decision NOUN
surface NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Move VERB
in ADP
a DET
direction NOUN
to PART
get AUX
one NUM
decision NOUN
surface NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
is AUX
one NUM
more ADJ
thing NOUN
which DET
we PRON
must VERB
understand VERB
that SCONJ
not PART
always ADV

----------------
There PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
need VERB
to PART
just ADV
get AUX
one NUM
, PUNCT
okay ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
in ADP
most ADJ
cases NOUN
we PRON
’ll VERB
get AUX
one NUM
and CCONJ
our DET
problem NOUN
is AUX
solved VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Finding VERB
out ADP
correct ADJ

The DET
next ADJ

in ADP
this DET

Now ADV
once SCONJ
you PRON

, PUNCT
what PRON

In ADP
fact NOUN

----------------
Every DET

If SCONJ
the DET

obviously ADV
the DET

So ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON

The DET

you PRON

In ADP

So ADV
that SCONJ
that DET

that DET

The DET

Now ADV

let VERB
us PRON
look VERB

the DET

How ADV
you PRON

How ADV
it PRON

----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
in ADP
traveling VERB
salesman NOUN
problem NOUN
you PRON
have AUX
cities NOUN
they PRON
are AUX
connected VERB
and CCONJ
those DET
connections NOUN
we PRON
… PUNCT
we PRON
call VERB
them PRON
segments NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
each DET
segment NOUN
is AUX
initialized VERB
with ADP
pheromone ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
zero NUM
in ADP
the DET
beginning NOUN
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
beginning NOUN
no DET
path NOUN
contains VERB
no DET
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
what PRON
you PRON
have AUX

do AUX
is AUX
to PART
start VERB
from ADP
one NUM
node NOUN
and CCONJ
send VERB
agents NOUN
to ADP
all DET

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
multiple ADJ
ants NOUN
are AUX
traveling VERB
on ADP
all DET
possible ADJ
paths NOUN
laying VERB
their DET

along ADP
the DET

in ADP
fact NOUN
in ADP
case NOUN

a DET

it PRON

Does AUX
something PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
phase NOUN
number NOUN
one NOUN
let VERB
them PRON
reach VERB

the DET
final ADJ
this DET

the DET
city NOUN

calculate VERB
the DET
distance NOUN
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
How ADV
it PRON
is AUX
done VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
Once SCONJ
this DET

done VERB
, PUNCT
then ADV
the DET
actual ADJ
processing NOUN
of ADP
algorithm NOUN
starts VERB
from ADP
now ADV
on ADV
because SCONJ
now ADV
we PRON
have AUX
some DET
value NOUN

pheromone NOUN
set VERB
for ADP
all DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
the DET
ants NOUN
will VERB
again ADV
start VERB
traveling VERB
from ADP
the DET
very ADJ
node NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
there PRON
are AUX
some DET

values NOUN
available ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
you PRON
do AUX
is AUX
you PRON
just ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
first ADJ
segment NOUN
and CCONJ
this DET
how ADV
the DET

are AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
let VERB
me PRON
even ADV
talk VERB
about ADP
the DET
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
the DET
length NOUN
is AUX
inversely ADV
proportional ADJ

length NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
pheromone ADJ
value NOUN
is AUX
some DET
constant ADJ
value NOUN
divided VERB
by ADP
the DET
length NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
longer ADJ
the DET
path NOUN
, PUNCT
less ADV
the DET
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so SCONJ
those DET
paths NOUN
are AUX
already ADV
found VERB
so SCONJ
that SCONJ
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
will VERB
… PUNCT
of ADP
a DET

, PUNCT
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
is AUX
equal ADJ

total ADJ
number NOUN

ants NOUN
traveled VERB
multiplied VERB
by ADP
the DET
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
that DET
they PRON
have AUX
sprayed VERB
on ADP
that DET
… PUNCT


  SPACE
So SCONJ
that DET
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
based VERB
on ADP
the DET
distance NOUN
also ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
longer ADJ
paths NOUN
lesser ADV
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
suppose VERB
you PRON
have AUX
five NUM
outgoing ADJ
possible ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
out SCONJ
of ADP
that DET
you PRON
choose VERB
the DET
best ADJ
okay ADJ
maximum ADJ
pheromone VERB
value NOUN
and CCONJ
go VERB

you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
next ADJ

the DET

okay ADV

you PRON

just ADV
that DET
okay INTJ

just ADV
go VERB

You PRON
just ADV
lay VERB

again ADV
once SCONJ
you PRON

and CCONJ
then ADV
again ADV
start VERB
the DET

----------------
When ADV
it PRON

each DET

the DET

updated VERB
, PUNCT
again ADV
the DET

----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON
will VERB
happen VERB
a DET
few ADJ
times NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
will VERB
find VERB
that SCONJ
almost ADV
all DET

start VERB
following VERB
one NUM

and CCONJ
that DET

obviously ADV
the DET
shortest ADJ

, PUNCT
the DET
same ADJ
way NOUN
like INTJ
we PRON
have AUX

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so SCONJ
you PRON
use VERB
multiple ADJ
agents NOUN
but CCONJ
eventually ADV
it PRON
’ll VERB
converge VERB
to ADP
a DET
single ADJ
path NOUN
which DET

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET

only ADV
about ADV
one NUM

one NUM

and CCONJ
you PRON

this DET
for ADP
all DET

and CCONJ
from ADP
those DET
destinations NOUN
to ADP
all DET
other ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
that DET
is AUX

be AUX
… PUNCT
so CCONJ
this DET
process NOUN
is AUX
to PART
be AUX
continuously ADV
repeated VERB
for ADP
all DET
such ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
you PRON
may VERB
do AUX
this DET
and CCONJ
you PRON
will VERB
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
get AUX
the DET
right ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
all DET
source NOUN
and CCONJ
destination NOUN
you PRON
will VERB
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
get AUX
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
this DET
way NOUN
, PUNCT
eventually ADV
you PRON
will VERB
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
get AUX
an DET
optimal ADJ
path NOUN
from ADP
any DET

any DET

and CCONJ
this DET
is AUX
precisely ADV
what PRON
we PRON
want VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Out SCONJ
of ADP
all DET
possible ADJ
cases NOUN
you PRON
get VERB
… PUNCT
converge VERB
to ADP
the DET
best ADJ
path NOUN
and CCONJ
once SCONJ
you PRON
start VERB
getting VERB
such ADJ
paths NOUN
obviously ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
will VERB
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
get AUX
the DET
right ADJ
tour NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
is AUX
called VERB
tour NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
once SCONJ
you PRON
get VERB
the DET
right ADJ
tour NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
job NOUN
is AUX
done VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
TSP PROPN
what PRON
you PRON
want VERB
to PART
get AUX
is AUX
the DET
same ADJ
node NOUN
back ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
even ADV
take VERB
that DET
case NOUN
- PUNCT
the DET
first ADJ
node ADJ
second ADJ
node PROPN
third ADJ
node NOUN
fourth ADJ
node NOUN
the DET
last ADJ
node NOUN
then ADV
the DET
node ADJ
itself PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
modify VERB
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
Once SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
that DET
, PUNCT
all DET
possible ADJ
tours NOUN
are AUX
provided VERB
to ADP
agents NOUN
and CCONJ
they PRON
travel VERB
on ADP
all DET
tours NOUN
and CCONJ
they PRON
do AUX
change VERB
and CCONJ
all DET
that DET
eventually ADV
they PRON
’ll VERB
converge VERB
to ADP
the DET
best ADJ
path NOUN
and CCONJ
mathematically ADV
representing VERB
this DET
part NOUN
is AUX
also ADV
possible ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON
you PRON
could VERB
do AUX
is AUX
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
say VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
for ADP
the DET
next ADJ
segment NOUN
, PUNCT
next ADJ
period NOUN
is AUX
equal ADJ
to ADP
older ADJ
pheromone NOUN
value NOUN
multiplied VERB
by ADP
one NUM
minus NOUN
row NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Row NOUN
is AUX
the DET
constant ADJ
rate NOUN
by ADP
which DET
it PRON
is AUX
decremented VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
some DET
value NOUN
is AUX
decremented VERB
okay ADV
, PUNCT
over ADV
… PUNCT
over ADP
the DET
period NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
plus CCONJ
whatever DET
is AUX
added VERB
by ADP
newly ADV
… PUNCT
new ADJ
ants NOUN
which DET
travels VERB
down ADP
that DET
path NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
components NOUN
which DET
are AUX
used VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Here ADV
it PRON
is AUX
shown VERB
as SCONJ
tau PROPN
T PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
tau NOUN
is AUX
the DET
value NOUN
of ADP
pheromone NOUN
equal ADJ

T NOUN
… PUNCT
T NOUN
… PUNCT
tau NOUN
T PROPN
the DET
earlier ADJ
one NUM
multiplied VERB
by ADP
one NUM
minus NOUN
rho NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
the DET
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
plus ADP
the DET
decrement NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
you PRON
add VERB
total ADJ
collective ADJ
pheromone NOUN
added VERB
by ADP
the DET
ants NOUN
in ADP
the DET
current ADJ
cycle NOUN
so ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
delta PROPN
tau PROPN
T PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
two NUM
components NOUN
are AUX
added VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON
is AUX
delta PROPN
tau PROPN
T PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
? PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
basically ADV
summation NOUN
of ADP
all DET
ants NOUN
and CCONJ
their DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
also ADV
talked VERB
about ADP
later ADV
in ADP
the DET
slide NOUN
that DET
delta PROPN
… PUNCT
delta PROPN
T PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
tau NOUN
T PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NOUN
is AUX
basically ADV
I PRON
equal VERB
to ADP
one NUM
to ADP
N NUM
delta NOUN
tau PROPN
T PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
I PRON
, PUNCT
which DET
is AUX
a DET
contribution NOUN
from ADP
Ith PROPN
ant NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
total ADJ
is AUX
basically ADV
collected VERB
from ADP
all DET
ants NOUN
traveled VERB
on ADP
that DET
path NOUN
and CCONJ
those DET
ants NOUN
which DET
have AUX
not PART
traveled VERB
on ADP
that DET
path NOUN
they PRON
’ll VERB
not PART
contribute VERB
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
one NUM
zero NUM
to ADP
n DET
only ADV
includes VERB
the DET
ants NOUN
which DET
traveled VERB
along ADP
that DET
path NOUN
and CCONJ
no DET
other ADJ
ants NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
again ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON
is AUX
the DET
I PRON
value VERB
? PUNCT
… PUNCT
What PRON
… PUNCT
what PRON
is AUX
… PUNCT
what PRON
is AUX
the DET
pheromone ADJ
value NOUN
that DET
an DET
ant NOUN
add VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
ant NOUN
adds VERB
a DET
pheromone VERB
value NOUN
equal ADJ
to ADP
the DET
constant ADJ
value NOUN
C NOUN
divided VERB
by ADP
the DET
path NOUN
length NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
longer ADV
the DET
path NOUN
less ADV
the DET

value NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
ACO PROPN

applied VERB
at ADP
many ADJ

where ADV
you PRON
need VERB

process VERB
in ADP
highly ADV
parallel ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
the DET
algorithm NOUN
is AUX
quite ADV
dynamically ADV
and CCONJ
an DET
adaptive ADJ
algorithm NOUN
which DET

learn VERB
on ADP
its DET

when ADV
there PRON

in ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
is AUX
the DET
other ADJ

which DET
also ADV
is AUX
quite ADV
useful ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
it PRON

not PART
an DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Sometimes ADV
people NOUN

it PRON
only ADV
a DET

----------------
Sometimes ADV
people NOUN

only ADV
in ADP
addition NOUN

----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN

is AUX
possible ADJ
to PART

used VERB
with ADP
other ADJ

as ADV
well ADV

----------------
So ADV
that DET

the DET
next ADJ
thing NOUN
that DET
we PRON
are AUX
going VERB
to PART
talk VERB
about ADP
is AUX
a DET
method NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
what PRON
is AUX
branch NOUN
and CCONJ
bounds NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Technically ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
pretty ADV
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
've AUX
started VERB
from ADP
A PROPN
and CCONJ
I PRON
want VERB
to PART
reach VERB
to ADP
Z. PROPN
----------------
So CCONJ
I PRON
travel VERB
along ADP
one NUM
path NOUN
and CCONJ
I PRON
get VERB
the DET
distance NOUN
from ADP
A PROPN
to ADP
Z NOUN
using VERB
that DET
path NOUN
is AUX
say NUM
thirty NUM
- PUNCT
five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
we PRON
start VERB
along ADP
some DET
other ADJ
path NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
wanted VERB
to PART
find VERB
the DET
shortest ADJ
path NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
I PRON
'll VERB
start VERB
exploring VERB
the DET
other ADJ
route NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
I PRON
've AUX
traveled VERB
A NOUN
to ADP
B NOUN
, PUNCT
B NOUN
to ADP
C PROPN
, PUNCT
C NOUN
to ADP
D NOUN
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
at ADP
that DET
point NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
goes VERB
beyond ADP
35 NUM
, PUNCT
it PRON
becomes VERB
40 NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
's AUX
the DET
point NOUN
in ADP
traveling VERB
along ADV
? PUNCT
----------------
This DET
path NOUN
is AUX
obviously ADV
longer ADJ

one NUM
that DET
I PRON
’ve VERB
already ADV
found VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
I PRON
do AUX
n't PART
need VERB
to PART
go VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
just ADV
skip VERB
that DET
and CCONJ
I PRON
'm AUX
not PART
skipping VERB
one NUM
path NOUN
, PUNCT
I PRON
'm AUX
skipping VERB
many ADJ
paths NOUN
, PUNCT
because SCONJ
after ADP
D NOUN
there PRON
may VERB
be AUX
nine NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
I PRON
'm AUX
skipping VERB
and CCONJ
I PRON
'm AUX
pruning VERB
all DET
those DET
branches NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
called VERB
branch NOUN
and CCONJ
bound VERB
, PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
some DET
simple ADJ
method NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
I PRON
get VERB
one NUM
as SCONJ
thirty NUM
- PUNCT
four NUM
the DET
other ADJ
one NUM
is AUX
twenty NUM
- PUNCT
two NUM
my DET
lower ADJ

twenty NUM
- PUNCT
two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
I PRON
will VERB
trim VERB
anything PRON
which DET

less ADJ

twenty NUM

two NUM
because SCONJ
I PRON
already ADV

twenty NUM

two NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
anything PRON

that DET

what PRON

----------------
I PRON

that SCONJ
the DET

So ADV

that DET

the DET
idea NOUN

pretty ADV

But CCONJ
how ADV

you PRON
search VERB

----------------
Okay INTJ
the DET

You PRON
just ADV
pick VERB

If SCONJ

If SCONJ

just ADV
terminate VERB

Okay INTJ

go VERB

Normally ADV
what PRON

Here ADV
you PRON

just ADV
terminate VERB
it PRON

You PRON

So CCONJ

they PRON

okay ADV
. PUNCT

So ADV
somehow ADV
BDC PROPN

----------------
So ADV
to PART
reach VERB

D NOUN
this DET

the DET

okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
we PRON
use VERB
that DET

----------------
So ADV
in ADP
the DET

we PRON

Now ADV
we PRON

everyone PRON
you PRON

Now ADV
if SCONJ

all DET
that DET
we PRON
… PUNCT
we PRON

----------------
We PRON
use VERB
two NUM

----------------
In ADP

But CCONJ
beyond ADP
D NOUN
you PRON
just ADV
use VERB
the DET

----------------
So ADV

one NUM

Remember VERB

if SCONJ
you PRON

non ADJ

So ADV

this DET

basically ADV
the DET

Remember VERB
the DET

example NOUN

you PRON

that DET
I PRON

that DET

Now ADV
you PRON

… PUNCT
in ADP
this DET

why ADV
you PRON

You PRON
just ADV
calculate VERB
like INTJ
you PRON

Yes INTJ

we PRON

But CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON

two NUM

five NUM

even ADV
one NUM

, PUNCT
it PRON

impossible ADJ
because SCONJ
the DET

too ADV
much ADJ

you PRON

So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON

and CCONJ
in ADP
that DET
case NOUN
this DET

quite ADV

So ADV
, PUNCT
there PRON

two NUM

----------------
One NUM
which DET

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
… PUNCT
the DET

we PRON

okay INTJ
so SCONJ
that SCONJ
we PRON

not PART

----------------
The DET
rest NOUN

So ADV

there PRON

… PUNCT
addition NOUN

And CCONJ
we PRON

we PRON

----------------
So SCONJ
we PRON

get AUX

So CCONJ
this DET

The DET

Sometimes ADV

If SCONJ

Okay INTJ
so ADV

Now ADV

they PRON

So CCONJ
we PRON

we PRON

----------------
G PROPN

Now ADV
for ADP
this DET

example NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
assume VERB
that SCONJ
every DET

So ADV

So ADV

V. PROPN
So ADV
obviously ADV

V NOUN
both DET

N PROPN
also ADV

The DET

----------------
That DET

B. PROPN

And CCONJ
the DET

In ADP
fact NOUN
there PRON

You PRON

But CCONJ
then ADV

when ADV
we PRON
the DET

obviously ADV

the DET

So ADV
that DET

how ADV
we PRON
… PUNCT
we PRON
use VERB
A DET

Now ADV
the DET

You PRON

If SCONJ

So ADV
you PRON

We PRON

So CCONJ
if SCONJ

Otherwise ADV

okay INTJ

But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON

one NUM
cases NOUN
I PRON

----------------
We PRON

G NOUN

So ADV
what PRON
if SCONJ

----------------
There PRON

three NUM

that DET

something PRON
which DET

very ADV
common ADJ

For ADP
example NOUN

there PRON

a DET

there PRON

three NUM

In ADP
that DET

quite ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ

C PROPN

A NOUN

D NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
not PART
every DET

… PUNCT
is AUX
the DET

if SCONJ
you PRON
accept VERB
that SCONJ

the DET
G PROPN

G NOUN

but CCONJ
the DET

----------------
When ADV
the DET

the DET

a DET

We PRON

take VERB
another DET
example NOUN
using VERB
another DET
PPT NOUN

okay INTJ

So ADV
that DET

now ADV
we PRON

taking VERB
the DET

actual ADJ
value NOUN

H NOUN

. PUNCT

Now ADV
we PRON
again ADV
start VERB
with ADP
W PROPN
, PUNCT
the DET

zero NUM

----------------
Okay INTJ
you PRON

there PRON

one NUM
thing NOUN
which DET
I PRON
… PUNCT
I PRON
… PUNCT
I PRON

now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
See VERB
this DET
fifteen NOUN

our DET

and CCONJ
we PRON
actually ADV

the DET

much ADV
earlier ADV
, PUNCT
out SCONJ

seven NUM

eight NUM
iterations NOUN
we PRON

I PRON
  SPACE

I PRON

in ADP
the DET
last ADJ
case NOUN
we PRON

… PUNCT
we PRON

the DET

Now ADV
we PRON
estimated VERB
it PRON

15 NUM
and CCONJ
we PRON

there ADV
in ADP
eight NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET

called VERB
overestimation NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
overestimate VERB
our DET
that DET
thing NOUN
exactly ADV
the DET
opposite ADJ
case NOUN
  SPACE

like SCONJ
A NOUN
the DET
W PROPN
says VERB
it PRON

four NUM

and CCONJ
it PRON
actually ADV
finds VERB
8 NUM
hops NOUN
away ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
called VERB
underestimating VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
which DET
is AUX
better ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
best ADV
is AUX
to PART
get AUX
the DET
right ADJ
estimate NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
get VERB
eight NUM
here ADV
it PRON
is AUX
the DET
best ADJ
thing NOUN
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
that DET
is AUX
never ADV
possible ADJ
in ADP
most ADJ
of ADP
the DET
real ADJ

world NOUN
cases NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
out SCONJ
of ADP
question NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
important ADJ
thing NOUN
about ADP
overestimating NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
it PRON

us PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
the DET
heuristic ADJ
function NOUN
is AUX
overestimating VERB
, PUNCT
it PRON
does AUX
n't PART

us PRON
the DET
optimal ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
the DET
underestimation NOUN
yes INTJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
are AUX
guaranteed VERB
to PART
get AUX
an DET
optimal ADJ
solution NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
we PRON
'll VERB
see VERB
little ADJ
later ADV
but CCONJ
point NOUN
is AUX
this DET
is AUX
overestimation NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
this DET
example NOUN
I PRON
have AUX
used VERB
overestimation NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
remember VERB
that SCONJ
however ADV
good ADJ
this DET
thing NOUN
is AUX
, PUNCT
it PRON
does AUX
not PART
guarantee VERB
us PRON
the DET
optimal ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
want VERB
to PART
get AUX
an DET
optimal ADJ
solution NOUN
there PRON
has AUX
to PART
be AUX
consistent ADJ
underestimation NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Anyway INTJ
so ADV
let VERB
us PRON
start VERB
again ADV
with ADP
W NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
zero NUM
and CCONJ
fifteen NUM
like INTJ
we PRON
had AUX
before ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
have AUX
both DET
children NOUN
like SCONJ
before ADV
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
G NOUN
value NOUN

… PUNCT
to PART
V NOUN
is AUX
five NUM
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
further ADV
very ADV
long ADJ
route NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
H NOUN
dash NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Similarly ADV
S PROPN
like SCONJ
previous ADJ
case NOUN
one NUM
and CCONJ
ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
S PROPN
is AUX
a DET
better ADJ
child NOUN
so SCONJ
we PRON
move VERB
further ADV
I PRON
wo VERB
n't PART
discuss VERB
much ADJ
about ADP
how ADV
they PRON
are AUX
explored VERB
and CCONJ
generated VERB
exactly ADV
like SCONJ
the DET
previous ADJ
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON
have AUX
H PROPN
and CCONJ
N NOUN
and CCONJ
out SCONJ
of ADP
that DET
N PROPN
is AUX
little ADV
better ADV
okay ADJ
is AUX
nine NUM
plus CCONJ
two NUM
that DET
is AUX
eleven NUM
so ADV
that DET
is AUX
short ADJ
minimum NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
now ADV
interesting ADJ
twist NOUN
in ADP
the DET
tale NOUN
comes VERB
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
N PROPN
has AUX
two NUM
children NOUN
M PROPN
and CCONJ
V. PROPN
In ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
just ADV
ignored VERB
V NOUN
because SCONJ
it PRON
's AUX
likely ADJ
to PART
have AUX
more ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
G. PROPN
Now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
value NOUN
of ADP
G NOUN
is AUX
three NUM
if SCONJ
you PRON
traverse VERB
through ADP
N. PROPN
What PRON
does AUX
that DET
mean VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
traverse VERB
you PRON
from ADP
W PROPN
to ADP
V NOUN
directly ADV
is AUX
a DET
longer ADJ
route NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
traverse VERB
that SCONJ
through ADP
S PROPN
and CCONJ
N PROPN
is AUX
a DET
shorter ADJ
route NOUN
which DET

which DET
the DET
length NOUN
of ADP
which DET
is AUX
only ADV
three NUM
and CCONJ
at ADP
this DET
point NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
the DET
shortest ADJ
path NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
a DET
difference NOUN
between ADP
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
and CCONJ
the DET
newer ADJ
case NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
we PRON
have AUX
assumed VERB
all DET
arcs NOUN
with ADP
the DET
same ADJ
length NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Here ADV
it PRON
is AUX
not PART
so ADV
, PUNCT
and CCONJ
that DET
's AUX
the DET
reason NOUN
why ADV
the DET
alternate ADJ
route NOUN

V PROPN
is AUX
found VERB
to PART
be AUX
a DET
better ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Seemingly ADV
longer ADJ
route NOUN
is AUX
actually ADV
shorter ADJ
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
probably ADV
you PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
something PRON
similar ADJ
in ADP
real ADJ
world NOUN
as ADV
well ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
point NOUN
is AUX
, PUNCT
this DET

different ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
after ADP
N NUM
in ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
picked VERB
N NUM
is AUX
the DET
next ADJ
best ADJ

, PUNCT
but CCONJ
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
we PRON
’ll VERB
pick VERB
up ADP
V. PROPN
See VERB
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM

V VERB
one NOUN
a DET
direct ADJ

and CCONJ
the DET
other ADJ
one NUM
which DET

S PROPN

N PROPN
and CCONJ
the DET
direct ADJ
path NOUN
is AUX
longer ADJ
and CCONJ
the DET
path NOUN

N NUM
is AUX
shorter ADJ
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
we PRON
'll VERB
pick VERB
up ADP
that DET
path NOUN
and CCONJ
now ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
V PROPN
is AUX
a DET
better ADJ
child NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
now ADV
we PRON
'll VERB
explore VERB
V PROPN
next ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
when ADV
we PRON
explore VERB
V NOUN
next ADP
it PRON
has AUX
only ADV
one NUM
child NOUN
called VERB
Z. NOUN
----------------
Now ADV
we PRON
explore VERB
Z NOUN
because SCONJ
that DET

the DET
only ADJ
one NUM
option NOUN
we PRON

it PRON
and CCONJ
we PRON

four NUM

seven NUM
total ADJ
eleven NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON

not PART

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON

the DET

but CCONJ
we PRON
still ADV
accept VERB
it PRON

----------------
We PRON
will VERB
go VERB
ahead ADV
with ADP
the DET
next ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
There PRON
are AUX
two NUM
children NOUN
of ADP
Z PROPN
Y PROPN
and CCONJ
A. NOUN
Y NOUN
obviously ADV
is AUX
more ADV
expensive ADJ

A NOUN
so ADV
we PRON

choose VERB
A PROPN
then ADV
X NOUN
, PUNCT
X PROPN
has AUX
two NUM
children NOUN
O NOUN
and CCONJ
U. PROPN
----------------
So CCONJ
O PRON
seems VERB
cheaper ADJ
because SCONJ
seven NUM
plus CCONJ
three NUM
that DET

ten NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON
sounds VERB
little ADJ
cheaper ADJ
compared VERB
to ADP
U NOUN
which DET

thirteen NUM

total NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
we PRON

Again ADV
there PRON

one NUM
more ADJ
twist NOUN
in ADP
the DET

So CCONJ
there PRON

a DET

O NOUN

K NOUN
which DET

nine NUM

five NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
that DET

----------------
So ADV
we PRON

… PUNCT
we PRON

that DET

So ADV
and CCONJ
it PRON

I PRON
other ADJ
one NUM

A. NOUN
----------------
The DET

I PRON

then ADV
you PRON

The DET

the DET
both DET

not PART
all ADV
that ADV
good ADJ

OK ADJ
link NOUN

So ADV

what PRON
we PRON
do AUX
is AUX

K PROPN
we PRON

O. PROPN
----------------
Now ADV
this DET

something PRON
which DET

This DET

possible ADJ

----------------
You PRON
explore VERB

----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
the DET

the DET

so ADV
large ADJ
that SCONJ

find VERB
that SCONJ
this DET

optimal ADJ

----------------
The DET
better ADJ

in ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
from ADP
O INTJ
there PRON
were AUX
two NUM

one NUM

I PRON
the DET

the DET
other ADJ
one NUM

OI PROPN
path NOUN
you PRON

----------------
So ADV
that DET

here ADV
where ADV
you PRON
explore VERB
I PRON
, PUNCT
you PRON

obviously ADV
K NOUN

one NUM

J PROPN

D PROPN
are AUX
the DET
other ADJ
two NUM

out SCONJ
of ADP
which DET
obviously ADV
D DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
we PRON
explore VERB
it PRON
and CCONJ
then ADV
it PRON
comes VERB

B NOUN
which DET

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
when ADV
we PRON
change VERB
that DET

, PUNCT
G NOUN

we PRON
take VERB

you PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
in ADP
real ADJ
world NOUN
this DET

also ADV
true ADJ
because SCONJ
G NOUN

what PRON
the DET
cost NOUN

----------------
Now ADV
that DET

again ADV

on ADP
perception NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
pick VERB
up ADP
a DET

Now ADV
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON

be AUX
different ADJ
if SCONJ
you PRON

it PRON

the DET
two NUM

----------------
So ADV
a DET
congested ADJ

less ADJ
… PUNCT
the DET

probably ADV

preferred VERB
on ADP
a DET
two NUM

less ADV
congested ADJ
but CCONJ
longer ADJ
route NOUN
is AUX
preferred VERB
by ADP
a DET

because SCONJ
your DET

----------------
In ADP
case NOUN

the DET
minus ADJ

that DET
you PRON

that DET

okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON

that DET
G NOUN

the DET
way NOUN
you PRON
look VERB
at ADP
G NOUN

the DET

----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
only ADV
every DET

as SCONJ
just ADV
one NUM

from ADP
it PRON
you PRON

but CCONJ
if SCONJ

take VERB
the DET

the DET

the DET

----------------
The DET
next ADJ

how ADV
that DET

----------------
The DET
only ADJ
important ADJ

in ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
this DET

you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
I PROPN
children NOUN
are AUX
P PROPN

D. PROPN
Now ADV
that DET
is AUX
coming VERB
after ADV
… PUNCT
so ADV
see VERB
look VERB
at ADP
two NUM

up ADP
O NOUN
had AUX
two NUM

K NOUN
and CCONJ
I PRON
out SCONJ

which DET
we PRON

K. PROPN
And CCONJ
when ADV
we PRON

K PROPN
after ADP
that DET
we PRON
realized VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

a DET
longer ADJ
path NOUN
we PRON
backtracked VERB
and CCONJ
started VERB

I. PROPN
----------------
Now ADV
that DET
is AUX
the DET
only ADJ
thing NOUN
which DET

different ADJ
in ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
case NOUN
than SCONJ
the DET
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
and CCONJ
that DET

why ADV
it PRON
is AUX
highlighted VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
now ADV
the DET
second ADJ
version NOUN
of ADP
A DET
star NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
They PRON
… PUNCT
nothing PRON
different ADJ
here ADV
it PRON
just ADV
initiate VERB
the DET
process NOUN
by ADP
adding VERB
a DET
root NOUN
node ADV
and CCONJ
then ADV
root NOUN
obviously ADV
has AUX
G NOUN
value NOUN
as SCONJ
zero NUM
and CCONJ
H NOUN
dash NOUN
value NOUN
as SCONJ
whatever DET
it PRON
is AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
G NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
again ADV
calculated VERB
when ADV
you PRON
explore VERB
the DET
nodes NOUN
the DET
child NOUN
you PRON
calculate VERB
that DET
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
a DET
city NOUN
map NOUN
probably ADV
you PRON
will VERB
calculate VERB
the DET
amount NOUN
of ADP
traffic NOUN
or CCONJ
… PUNCT
or CCONJ
the DET
distance NOUN
or CCONJ
the DET
time NOUN
you PRON
take VERB
to PART
… PUNCT
reach VERB
to ADP
that DET
whatever DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
G NOUN
value NOUN
you PRON
calculate VERB
the DET
value NOUN
find VERB
out ADP
what PRON
's AUX
the DET
cost NOUN
of ADP
reaching VERB
to ADP
the DET
next ADJ
node NOUN
that SCONJ
child NOUN
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
child NOUN
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
keep VERB
them PRON
in ADP
the DET
list NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
unexplored ADJ
node ADV
okay INTJ
, PUNCT
like INTJ
we PRON
did AUX
before ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
only ADJ
catch NOUN
comes VERB
where ADV
you PRON
have AUX
to PART
backtrack VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
path NOUN
variable NOUN
, PUNCT
which DET
is AUX
always ADV
adding VERB
the DET
new ADJ
node NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
there PRON
is AUX
need NOUN
to PART
backtrack VERB
, PUNCT
that DET
part NOUN
is AUX
to PART
be AUX
extracted VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
part NOUN
is AUX
to PART
be AUX
removed VERB
and CCONJ
then ADV
you PRON
again ADV
start VERB
from ADP
the DET
optimal ADJ
path NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
a DET
different ADJ
part NOUN
that DET
is AUX
little ADV
complicated ADJ
thing NOUN
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
that DET
's AUX
what PRON
you PRON
're AUX
supposed VERB
to PART
do AUX
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
why ADV
this DET
backtracking NOUN
is AUX
necessary ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
Sometimes ADV
now ADV
there PRON
's AUX
… PUNCT
there PRON
’s VERB
something PRON
okay INTJ
what PRON
… PUNCT
what PRON
if SCONJ
the DET
values NOUN
are AUX
changed VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
the DET
previous ADJ
case NOUN
if SCONJ
you PRON
… PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
remember VERB
those DET
key ADJ
estimate NOUN
was AUX
less ADJ
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
when ADV
it PRON
explores VERB
the DET
children NOUN
calculates VERB
the DET
G NOUN
value NOUN
it PRON
realizes VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
longer ADJ
than SCONJ
it PRON
was AUX
expecting VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
whatever DET
your DET
expectations NOUN
H PROPN
dash NOUN
value NOUN
whatever DET
you PRON
assumed VERB
, PUNCT
once SCONJ
you PRON
explore VERB
your DET
children NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
likely ADJ
to PART
change VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
that DET
was AUX
propagated VERB
back ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
previous ADJ
node NOUN
O NOUN
node NOUN
found VERB
that SCONJ
O NOUN
to ADP
K PROPN
path NOUN
which DET
it PRON
thought VERB
was AUX
shorter ADJ
is AUX
actually ADV
a DET
little ADJ
longer ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
it PRON
chosen VERB
it PRON
has AUX
chosen VERB
that SCONJ
OI PROPN
path NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
that SCONJ
unless SCONJ
you PRON
propagate VERB
that DET
back ADV
probably ADV
you PRON
will VERB
not PART
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
get AUX
the DET
optimal ADJ
path NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
here ADV
is AUX
also ADV
very ADV
, PUNCT
very ADV
important ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
that DET
is AUX
necessary ADJ
is AUX
shown VERB
in ADP
the DET
next ADJ
slide NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
, PUNCT
now ADV
this DET
is AUX
a DET
little ADJ
different ADJ
kind NOUN
of ADP
a DET
graph NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
again ADV
, PUNCT
our DET
starting NOUN
or CCONJ
the DET
root NOUN
node ADV
is AUX
assumed VERB
to PART
be AUX
W. PROPN
But CCONJ
assume VERB
that SCONJ
now ADV
it PRON
is AUX
connected VERB
by ADP
some DET
other ADJ
node NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON
… PUNCT
we PRON
assume VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
G NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
N PROPN
and CCONJ
S PROPN
is AUX
N PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
five NUM
… PUNCT
twelve NUM
or CCONJ
five NUM
, PUNCT
fifteen NUM
something PRON
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
something PRON
is AUX
being AUX
calculated VERB
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
in ADP
the DET
beginning NOUN
W PROPN
was AUX
N NOUN
and CCONJ
fifteen NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
when ADV
you PRON
explore VERB
X NOUN
and CCONJ
V NOUN
we PRON
realize VERB
that SCONJ
instead ADV
of ADP
fifteen NUM
, PUNCT
S PROPN
says VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
only ADV
twelve NUM
hops NOUN
away ADV
and CCONJ
V PROPN
says VERB
  SPACE
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
fifteen NUM
hops NOUN
away ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
the DET
G NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
five NUM
G NOUN
value NOUN
is AUX
more ADJ
, PUNCT
just ADV
assume VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
N PROPN
plus CCONJ
one NUM
N NOUN
is AUX
assume VERB
N PROPN
to PART
be AUX
four NUM
then ADV
S PROPN
is AUX
better ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
it PRON
is AUX
only ADV
twelve NUM
plus CCONJ
one NUM
thirteen NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
W PROPN
earlier ADV
it PRON
was AUX
thinking VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
goal NOUN
node ADV
is AUX
fifteen NUM
hops NOUN
away ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
after ADP
exploring VERB
two NUM
children NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
can VERB
say VERB
that SCONJ
if SCONJ
it PRON
goes VERB
via ADP
S PROPN
it PRON
's AUX
going VERB
to PART
be AUX
thirteen NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
shorter ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
if SCONJ
it PRON
… PUNCT
should VERB
it PRON
improve VERB
that DET
? PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON
does AUX
n't PART
what PRON
will VERB
happen VERB
see VERB
AB PROPN
also ADV
there PRON
is AUX
… PUNCT
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
point NOUN
there PRON
is AUX
node ADJ
which DET
is AUX
called VERB
AB PROPN
, PUNCT
which DET
also ADV
makes VERB
a DET
decision NOUN
it PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON
has AUX
two NUM
children NOUN
W PROPN
and CCONJ
AC PROPN
and CCONJ
out SCONJ
of ADP
which DET
it PRON
choses VERB
W PROPN
and CCONJ
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
when ADV
the DET
estimate NOUN
is AUX
getting VERB
better ADJ
, PUNCT
the DET
best ADJ
path NOUN
still ADV
remains VERB
the DET
same ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON
do AUX
n't PART
need VERB
to PART
worry VERB
about ADP
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
quite ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
also ADV
a DET
decision NOUN
being AUX
made VERB
at ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ
point NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
assume NOUN
that SCONJ
the DET
S PROPN
value NOUN
instead ADV
of ADP
twelve NUM
is AUX
seventeen NUM
and CCONJ
V NOUN
value NOUN
instead ADV
of ADP
fifteen NUM
is AUX
fifty NUM
is AUX
twenty NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
W PROPN
value NOUN
instead ADV
of ADP
fifteen NUM
changes NOUN
to ADP
a DET
higher ADJ
value NOUN
in ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
… PUNCT
if SCONJ
it PRON
chooses VERB
S PROPN
it PRON
is AUX
going VERB
to PART
be AUX
twenty NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
is AUX
going VERB
to PART
be AUX
larger ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
not PART
propagated VERB
back ADV
, PUNCT
AB PROPN
will VERB
not PART
be AUX
in ADP
a DET
position NOUN
to PART
decide VERB
that SCONJ
AB PROPN
W PROPN
is AUX
no ADV
longer ADV
an DET
optimal ADJ
path NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
AB PROPN
AC PROPN
is AUX
better ADV
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
is AUX
very ADV
important ADJ
even ADV
if SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
improvement NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
may VERB
not PART
propagate VERB
it PRON
back ADV
but CCONJ
if SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
improvement NOUN
you PRON
should VERB
do AUX
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
but CCONJ
then ADV
even ADV
in ADP
the DET
case NOUN
of ADP
improvement NOUN
like SCONJ
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
where ADV
W NOUN
the DET
estimate NOUN
from ADP
W NOUN
changes NOUN
to ADP
thirteen NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON
does AUX
n't PART
propagate VERB
back ADV
what PRON
will VERB
happen VERB
is AUX
if SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
some DET
change NOUN
in ADP
that DET
graph NOUN
later ADV
which DET
says VERB
that SCONJ
AC PROPN
is AUX
N PROPN
fourteen NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Incorrectly ADV
AB PROPN
would VERB
prefer VERB
AC PROPN
if SCONJ
that DET
right ADJ
estimate NOUN
is AUX
not PART
sent VERB
back ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
to PART
prevent VERB
that SCONJ
even ADV
the DET
correct ADJ
estimates NOUN
are AUX
to PART
be AUX
propagated VERB
back ADV
and CCONJ
they PRON
are AUX
to PART
be AUX
propagated VERB
back ADV
to ADP
whatever DET
root NOUN
node ADV
is AUX
okay ADJ
. PUNCT
So ADV
all DET
paths NOUN
are AUX
to PART
be AUX
updated VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
this DET
is AUX
a DET
critical ADJ
part NOUN
about ADP
A DET
star NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
with ADP
that DET
note NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
come VERB
to ADP
an DET
end NOUN
of ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
module NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
module NOUN
, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
looked VERB

an DET
important ADJ
algorithm NOUN

A DET

we PRON
have AUX

two NUM
versions NOUN
of ADP
A DET

in ADP
this DET
particular ADJ
module NOUN
and CCONJ
in ADP
fact NOUN
the DET
third ADJ
version NOUN
requires VERB
that SCONJ
back ADJ
propagation NOUN
which DET
we PRON
have AUX
not PART

, PUNCT
but CCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
an DET
example NOUN

… PUNCT
It PRON

about ADV
two NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM

the DET
estimate NOUN
from ADP
the DET
current ADJ

the DET

and CCONJ
the DET
cost NOUN

to PART
reach VERB
to ADP
this DET
current ADJ

and CCONJ
always ADV
we PRON
’ll VERB
pick VERB
up ADP
a DET

which DET
has AUX
best ADJ
G NOUN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN

----------------
G NOUN
is AUX
the DET
cost NOUN
and CCONJ
H NOUN
dash NOUN
is AUX
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
why ADV
H NOUN
dash NOUN
and CCONJ
not PART
H PROPN
? PUNCT
----------------
G NOUN
is AUX
G PROPN
H PROPN
is AUX
not PART
H NOUN
but CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
H PROPN
dash NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
the DET
designer NOUN
us PRON
trying VERB

convey VERB
that SCONJ
H PROPN
is AUX
the DET
correct ADJ
distance NOUN
and CCONJ
H NOUN
dash NOUN
is AUX
an DET

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
dash NOUN
is AUX
indicate VERB
… PUNCT
indicator NOUN

that DET
assumption NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
H NOUN
dash NOUN
is AUX
a DET
prediction NOUN
of ADP
the DET
H PROPN

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV

will VERB
pick VERB

the DET
best ADJ

okay INTJ
based VERB

G PROPN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN

so ADV
we PRON

In ADP
fact NOUN

I PRON

I PRON

So CCONJ
I PRON
am AUX
not PART
going VERB

discuss VERB
that DET

----------------
But CCONJ
what PRON
does AUX
that DET

? PUNCT
----------------
The DET
admissible ADJ

for ADP
all DET

For ADP
all DET

, PUNCT
if SCONJ

, PUNCT
we PRON
call VERB
the DET

Now ADV
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
try VERB

see VERB
if SCONJ
what PRON
if SCONJ
H NOUN

H. PROPN
Now ADV
I PRON
have AUX
a DET

, PUNCT
again ADV
slide VERB
animation NOUN

PPT PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
run VERB
that SCONJ
PPT NOUN
and CCONJ
see VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
A DET
has AUX
two NUM
children NOUN
C PROPN

B. PROPN
----------------
C PROPN
is AUX
seven NUM
plus CCONJ
one NUM

----------------
Now ADV
when ADV
I PRON
say VERB
seven NUM
plus CCONJ
one NUM
or CCONJ
seven NUM
comma ADJ
one NOUN
sometimes ADV
one NUM

G NOUN
one NUM

H. PROPN
Now ADV
looking VERB

the DET

you PRON

decide VERB
what PRON

G NOUN
what PRON

H. PROPN
In ADP
this DET
case NOUN
I PRON
have AUX
purposefully ADV
reversed VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Seven NUM
is AUX
H NOUN
and CCONJ
one NUM

G. PROPN
So ADV
sometimes ADV
it PRON

done VERB
this DET
way NOUN
so ADV
that DET

why ADV
I PRON

this DET
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
which DET
is AUX
better ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
B PROPN
is AUX
better ADJ
because SCONJ
five NUM

one NUM
six NUM
hops NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
C PROPN
is AUX
a DET

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
are AUX

, PUNCT
we PRON
say VERB
that SCONJ
seven NUM

it PRON

and CCONJ
B NOUN

when ADV
we PRON
say VERB
B NOUN
, PUNCT
B PROPN
is AUX
five NUM
, PUNCT
actually ADV
it PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
when ADV
we PRON
explore VERB
B NOUN
it PRON

only ADV
one NUM
child NOUN
called VERB
D NOUN
and CCONJ
it PRON
says VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

four NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
we PRON
are AUX
all DET
adding VERB
G NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
we PRON
are AUX
all DET
… PUNCT
adding VERB
one NUM
, PUNCT
so ADV
four NUM

two NUM
six NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
Then ADV
E NOUN
is AUX
three NUM

three NUM

then ADV
… PUNCT
so CCONJ
… PUNCT
you PRON
… PUNCT
you PRON
we PRON

not PART
actually ADV
… PUNCT
we PRON

… PUNCT
we PRON
say VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON

but CCONJ
the DET
next ADJ
one NOUN

the DET

called VERB
G. PROPN
We PRON
reached VERB
there ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
at ADP
any DET

when ADV
we PRON
explore VERB
B NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
six NUM
compared VERB

seven NUM
it PRON

eight NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
B NOUN
is AUX
better ADJ
and CCONJ
we PRON
explore VERB
D NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
six NUM
compared VERB

C NOUN
eight NUM
, PUNCT
it PRON

----------------
When ADV
we PRON
explored VERB
E NOUN
is AUX
three NUM

three NUM
was AUX
six NUM
, PUNCT
which DET
again ADV

C. PROPN
And CCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
got VERB
a DET
child NOUN

G NOUN
whatever DET
the DET

, PUNCT
we PRON
have AUX
got VERB
through ADP
that DET

a DET

. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
C PROPN
says VERB
that SCONJ
G PROPN

seven NUM
hops NOUN
away ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Actually ADV
it PRON

only ADV
one NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET

costed VERB
us PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON

the DET

----------------
That DET

a DET

. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
if SCONJ
there PRON

an DET

? PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
let VERB
us PRON
try VERB

see VERB
a DET
similar ADJ

----------------
We PRON
start VERB

A NOUN
we PRON

C. PROPN
B PROPN

----------------
Obviously ADV
B PROPN

----------------
So ADV
we PRON
explore VERB
we PRON
have AUX
a DET
D NOUN
okay NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that SCONJ
D NOUN

two NUM

four NUM
now ADV
you PRON

see VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
we PRON

… PUNCT
in ADP
the DET

it PRON

but CCONJ
after ADP
one NUM

it PRON
still ADV

. PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
, PUNCT
our DET

So ADV

it PRON

----------------
We PRON

Every DET

we PRON

----------------
At ADP
this DET

four NUM

what PRON
we PRON

we PRON

C NOUN
now ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON

two NUM

four NUM
now ADV
we PRON

two NUM

four NUM
is AUX
same ADJ

----------------
So ADV
we PRON

it PRON

three NUM

three NUM
, PUNCT
which DET

again ADV
better ADJ

J PROPN
which DET

we PRON

you PRON

The DET

So ADV
, PUNCT
we PRON

K. PROPN
One NUM

so ADV
… PUNCT
so ADV
we PRON

K PROPN

we PRON

G. PROPN


 SPACE
Now ADV
what PRON
happened VERB
here ADV
actually ADV

----------------
Though PROPN
B PROPN
… PUNCT
we PRON

what PRON

the DET

So ADV
before ADP

What PRON

We PRON

we PRON

obviously ADV

that DET

we PRON

Now ADV
though SCONJ
this DET

simple ADJ
… PUNCT
it PRON

definitely ADV
simple ADJ

it PRON

very ADV

very ADV
interesting ADJ
also ADV

. PUNCT
----------------
That DET

, PUNCT
once SCONJ
we PRON

this DET
we PRON

the DET

okay INTJ

Looking VERB

… PUNCT
if SCONJ
we PRON

this DET
further ADV
you PRON

H PROPN

, PUNCT
you PRON

see VERB
that DET

that DET

actually ADV

So ADV
even ADV
if SCONJ
we PRON

you PRON

we PRON
probably ADV

so ADV
previous ADJ
the DET

So ADV
we PRON

it PRON

switch VERB

They PRON

we PRON

You PRON

the DET

Okay INTJ

You PRON

----------------
Okay INTJ

that DET

the DET

Now ADV

you PRON
choose VERB
a DET

Now ADV

in ADP
the DET
previous ADJ
that DET

you PRON
know VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON

But CCONJ
then ADV
how ADV

----------------
If SCONJ

then ADV
you PRON
only ADV

----------------
In ADP
this DET

But CCONJ
the DET

maximum ADJ

----------------
So ADV

What PRON

That DET

So ADV

So CCONJ
this DET

an DET
example NOUN

----------------
In ADP
the DET
final ADJ

you PRON

Here ADV
we PRON

actually ADV

In ADP
the DET
final ADJ

there PRON

no DET

so ADV
that DET

zero NUM
and CCONJ
that DET

what PRON
we PRON

----------------
So ADV

we PRON

So ADV

And CCONJ
we PRON

So ADV

So CCONJ

Remember VERB
our DET

This DET

that DET

why ADV
it PRON

very ADV
good ADJ

Okay INTJ

Let VERB
us PRON
look VERB

the DET

Okay INTJ
there PRON

one NUM

one NUM
two NUM
three NUM
seven NUM

Now ADV
this DET

a DET
very ADV
typical ADJ

this DET
one NUM

Now ADV
there PRON

… PUNCT
you PRON

okay INTJ

One NUM
which DET

one NUM

the DET
other ADJ
one NUM

seven NUM
here ADV

the DET
third ADJ
one NOUN

Okay INTJ
so ADV
there PRON

three NUM

possible ADJ
and CCONJ
that DET

why ADV
there PRON

If SCONJ

right ADV
most ADJ

seems VERB
great ADJ
because SCONJ
only ADV

----------------
So ADV
okay INTJ
and CCONJ
second ADJ
one NOUN
also ADV

So CCONJ
we PRON
assume VERB

Now ADV
you PRON

But CCONJ
if SCONJ

you PRON
actually ADV

choose VERB
either CCONJ

But CCONJ
you PRON

the DET
second ADJ

So ADV
you PRON

----------------
If SCONJ
you PRON

what PRON
you PRON

And CCONJ
you PRON

you PRON

something PRON
okay ADJ

If SCONJ

if SCONJ

then ADV
the DET

----------------
You PRON

For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
in ADP
a DET

you PRON
looking VERB

encountered VERB
a DET

----------------
Now ADV
that DET
bank NOUN
maybe ADV
two NUM
, PUNCT
one NUM

the DET
two NUM
different ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
have AUX
okay ADJ

But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
is AUX
one NUM
more ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’s VERB
talking VERB

somewhere ADV
later ADV
then ADV
it PRON
is AUX
more ADV
likely ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
you PRON
have AUX
two NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
two NUM

the DET
financial PROPN

, PUNCT
one NUM

, PUNCT
obviously ADV
their DET

to ADP
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
financial ADJ

----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
in ADP
the DET

or CCONJ
the DET
natural ADJ

you PRON

----------------
And CCONJ
same ADJ
case NOUN
with ADP
malaria PROPN
which DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
fever NOUN

malaria PROPN
while SCONJ
the DET
viral ADJ

also ADV
possible ADJ
when ADV
you PRON
have AUX

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
parents NOUN
pointing VERB
to ADP
malaria PROPN
so ADV
we PRON
'll VERB
choose VERB
that DET
first ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
more ADJ
example NOUN
is AUX
… PUNCT
is AUX
organizing VERB
a DET

. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
you PRON

----------------
In ADP
that DET
case NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
first ADJ
child NOUN
which DET

, PUNCT
part NOUN
… PUNCT
participation NOUN

then ADV
in ADP
case NOUN

okay ADJ
in ADP
inviting VERB

and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
once SCONJ
you PRON
… PUNCT
you PRON
go VERB
through ADP
that DET
, PUNCT
you PRON
may VERB
find VERB
a DET
task NOUN
which DET
is AUX
also ADV
has AUX
something PRON
to PART
do AUX
with ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
booking VERB
a DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Booking VERB
a DET

requires VERB
you PRON
to PART
figure VERB
out ADP
how ADV
… PUNCT
what PRON
will VERB
be AUX
the DET
strength NOUN
of ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
that DET
you PRON
'll VERB
have AUX
to PART
look VERB
at ADP
the DET
venue NOUN
… PUNCT
venue NOUN
management NOUN
obviously ADV
involves VERB
this DET
but CCONJ
then ADV
participation NOUN
management NOUN
also ADV
involves VERB
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
… PUNCT
you PRON
will VERB
have AUX
to PART
find VERB
out ADP
what PRON
… PUNCT
how ADV
many ADJ
participants NOUN
are AUX
going VERB
to PART
come VERB
and CCONJ
the DET
venue PROPN
management NOUN
also ADV
requires VERB
the DET
hall NOUN
to PART
be AUX
fixed VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
when ADV
you PRON
… PUNCT
when ADV
you PRON
find VERB
that SCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
task NOUN
which DET
has AUX
multiple ADJ

obviously ADV
that DET
bubbles VERB
up ADP
to ADP
the DET
top NOUN
and CCONJ
it PRON
will VERB
be AUX
the DET
highest ADJ

job NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
you PRON
do AUX
is AUX
usually ADV
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
that DET
job NOUN
first ADV
and CCONJ
book VERB
your DET

first ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
that DET
's AUX
how ADV
the DET
agenda NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
They PRON
also ADV
need VERB
, PUNCT
in ADP
fact NOUN
there PRON
are AUX
few ADJ
additional ADJ
things NOUN
required VERB
in ADP
agenda NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
Every DET
task NOUN
is AUX
to PART
be AUX
divided VERB
into ADP
sub NOUN
task NOUN
once ADV
in ADP
a DET
while NOUN
and CCONJ
every DET
task NOUN
again ADV
maybe ADV
sub VERB
task NOUN
also ADV
further ADV
divided VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Every DET
task NOUN
will VERB
add VERB
a DET
justification NOUN
when ADV
it PRON
generates VERB
the DET
children NOUN
and CCONJ
when ADV
you PRON
have AUX
a DET
multiple ADJ
parent NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
makes VERB
a DET
lot NOUN
of ADP
sense NOUN
in ADP
this DET
case NOUN
because SCONJ
that DET
will VERB
add VERB
to ADP
the DET
level NOUN
of ADP
justification NOUN
and CCONJ
improves VERB
the DET
priority NOUN
and CCONJ
agenda NOUN
is AUX
always ADV
stored VERB
based VERB
on ADP
the DET
priority NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
sometimes ADV
more ADJ
than SCONJ
one NUM
indicators NOUN
are AUX
not PART
all ADV
that ADV
important ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Some DET
… PUNCT
for ADP
example NOUN
… PUNCT
for ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
… PUNCT
if SCONJ
you PRON
find VERB
that SCONJ
battery NOUN
is AUX
weak ADJ
and CCONJ
also ADV
light NOUN
is AUX
not PART
turning VERB
on ADP
for ADP
your DET

, PUNCT
then ADV
whenever ADV
this DET
one NUM
thing NOUN
happens VERB
, PUNCT
the DET
other ADJ
will VERB
surely ADV
happen VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
this DET
two NUM
does AUX
not PART
add VERB
significant ADJ
justification NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
one NUM
thing NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
second ADJ
is AUX
sometimes ADV
there PRON
are AUX
two NUM
parents NOUN
but CCONJ
one NUM

them PRON
is AUX
very ADV
, PUNCT
very ADV
strong ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
having VERB
a DET
fever NOUN
is AUX
one NUM
and CCONJ
blood NOUN

positive ADJ
is AUX
the DET
other ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
blood NOUN
report NOUN
positive ADJ
is AUX
a DET
strong ADJ
justification NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
agenda NOUN
driven VERB
system NOUN
should VERB
consider VERB
that SCONJ
more ADV
important ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
justification NOUN
value NOUN
or CCONJ
the DET

is AUX
much ADV
higher ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
One NUM
more ADJ
thing NOUN
in ADP
A DET

algorithm NOUN
every DET

a DET
single ADJ

In ADP
some DET

----------------
One NUM
typical ADJ
example NOUN
is AUX
shown VERB
on ADP
the DET

We PRON

it PRON

both CCONJ

there ADV

a DET
… PUNCT
there PRON

so ADV
here ADV
if SCONJ

if SCONJ

while SCONJ

Let VERB
us PRON

you PRON

A DET

So ADV
iterative ADJ

The DET

As SCONJ

We PRON

The DET

why ADV

Because SCONJ

why ADV

Why ADV

next ADV
okay INTJ

so SCONJ

But CCONJ
in ADP
case NOUN

so ADV
they PRON

also ADV
examples NOUN

We PRON

short ADJ
first ADV

then ADV
we PRON

agents NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
They PRON
were AUX
… PUNCT
both DET
IDA PROPN

RBF PROPN
were AUX
proposed VERB
by ADP
a DET
guy NOUN

Richard PROPN
Korf PROPN

. PUNCT
----------------
He PRON
was AUX
interested ADJ
in ADP
reducing VERB
the DET
amount NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
He PRON
assumed VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
amount NOUN

maybe ADV
more ADV

but CCONJ
the DET

be AUX
less ADJ
and CCONJ
he PRON

devised VERB
this DET
two NUM
algorithms NOUN
and CCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
three NUM
things NOUN
that DET
he PRON
wanted VERB

optimize VERB
precisely ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
First ADV
the DET
amount NOUN
of ADP
memory NOUN
that DET
is AUX
to PART
be AUX
used VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
cost NOUN
of ADP
finding VERB
the DET

itself PRON
and CCONJ
the DET
path NOUN

the DET

itself PRON

----------------
And CCONJ
he PRON

computational ADJ
biology NOUN
problem NOUN
where ADV
you PRON
… PUNCT
the DET
search NOUN

----------------
So ADV
number NOUN

and CCONJ
permutations NOUN
become VERB
very ADV
, PUNCT
very ADV
large ADJ
after ADP
a DET
while NOUN

----------------
And CCONJ
when ADV
that DET
happens VERB
, PUNCT
it PRON
becomes VERB
very ADV
hard ADJ
for ADP
the DET
algorithm NOUN
to PART
proceed VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
amount NOUN

that DET
you PRON
need VERB

… PUNCT
amount NOUN

that DET
you PRON

goes VERB
quite ADV
high ADJ
and CCONJ
because SCONJ
of ADP
that DET
, PUNCT
that DET
leads VERB

issue NOUN
… PUNCT
trouble NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET
IDA PROPN
star NOUN
how ADV
it PRON
works VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Both DET
IDF PROPN

and CCONJ
RBF PROPN
both DET
… PUNCT
you PRON
has AUX
a DET
linear ADJ
space NOUN
… PUNCT
space NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
means VERB
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
amount NOUN
of ADP
search NOUN
space NOUN
at ADP
any DET
given VERB
point NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
increases VERB
linearly ADV
rather ADV
than SCONJ
exponentially ADV
because SCONJ
in ADP
case NOUN
of ADP
grid NOUN
it PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON
increases VERB
exponentially ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
number NOUN
of ADP
paths NOUN
that DET
you PRON
re VERB
… PUNCT
require VERB
to PART
explore VERB
at ADP
every DET
point NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
is AUX
exponential ADJ
in ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
normal ADJ
case NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
this DET
case NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
linear ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
the DET
biggest ADJ
achievement NOUN
of ADP
IDA PROPN
star NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Obviously ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON
… PUNCT
it PRON
adds VERB
to ADP
the DET
cost NOUN
of ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
same ADJ
nodes NOUN
are AUX
explored VERB
again ADV
and CCONJ
again ADV
because SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
remember VERB
that SCONJ
this DET
node NOUN
is AUX
already ADV
explored VERB
, PUNCT
is AUX
going VERB
to PART
add VERB
to ADP
that DET
time NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
's AUX
a DET
disadvantage NOUN
of ADP
this DET
algorithm NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
in ADP
one NUM
sense NOUN
, PUNCT
this DET
IDA PROPN
star NOUN
is AUX
more ADV
near ADJ
to PART
depth VERB
first ADV
this DET
limited ADJ
search NOUN
that DET
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
in ADP
probably ADV
the DET
fourth ADJ
module NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
the DET
idea NOUN
is AUX
very ADV
simple ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Remember VERB
DFDL PROPN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
does AUX
it PRON
do AUX
? PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
explores VERB
… PUNCT
it PRON
assumes VERB
the DET
length NOUN
to PART
be AUX
some DET
value NOUN
, PUNCT
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Depth NOUN
maximum NOUN
three NUM
or CCONJ
four NUM
or CCONJ
five NUM
now ADV
you PRON
explore VERB
that SCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
reach VERB
there ADV
you PRON
limited VERB
okay ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Go VERB
back ADV
act NOUN
like SCONJ
you PRON
’ve VERB
reached VERB
to ADP
a DET
dead ADJ
end NOUN
and CCONJ
you PRON
go VERB
ahead ADV
and CCONJ
explore VERB
the DET
search NOUN
space NOUN
for ADP
that DET
depth NOUN
only ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
in ADP
DF PROPN
depth NOUN
first ADJ
depth NOUN
limited VERB
usually ADV
you PRON
start VERB
with ADP
length NOUN
equal ADJ
to ADP
one NUM
then ADV
two NUM
then ADV
three NUM
or CCONJ
you PRON
start VERB
with ADP
three NUM
and CCONJ
six NUM
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Here ADV
instead ADV
of ADP
that SCONJ
it PRON
's AUX
quite ADV
interesting ADJ
move NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
do AUX
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
just ADV
use VERB
a DET
G NOUN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN
take VERB
a DET
specific ADJ
value NOUN
of ADP
G NOUN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
just ADV
say VERB
that SCONJ
three NUM
G PROPN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN
to PART
be AUX
three NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
what PRON
do AUX
you PRON
do AUX
use VERB
a DET
start NOUN
exploring VERB
nodes NOUN
and CCONJ
whenever ADV
G NOUN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN
value NOUN
goes VERB
beyond ADP
three NUM
you PRON
just ADV
stop VERB
and CCONJ
take VERB
a DET
previous ADJ
node NOUN
and CCONJ
take VERB
the DET
other ADJ
branch NOUN
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
, PUNCT
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
IDA PROPN
star NOUN
is AUX
very ADV
similar ADJ
to ADP
DFDL PROPN
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
the DET
only ADJ
point NOUN
is AUX
you PRON
just ADV
use VERB
G PROPN
… PUNCT
G PROPN
plus CCONJ
F. PROPN
Now ADV
why ADV
G PROPN
plus CCONJ
F PROPN
is AUX
better ADJ
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
you PRON
know VERB
that SCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
traverse VERB
in ADP
the DET
wrong ADJ
direction NOUN
the DET
G NOUN
and CCONJ
H PROPN
… PUNCT
H NOUN
dash NOUN
value NOUN
will VERB
go VERB
high ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
when ADV
the DET
G NOUN
and CCONJ
H PROPN
value NOUN
go VERB
high ADJ
the DET
wrong ADJ
direction NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
wo VERB
n't PART
move VERB
further ADV
much ADV
but CCONJ
the DET
right ADJ
direction NOUN
because SCONJ
G PROPN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
remember VERB
the DET
case NOUN
that DET
we PRON
have AUX
seen VERB
in ADP
the DET
previous ADJ
module NOUN
, PUNCT
G PROPN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
was AUX
consistently ADV
to PART
be AUX
six NUM
almost ADV
till SCONJ
the DET
end NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
those DET
things NOUN
were AUX
the DET
… PUNCT
those DET
nodes NOUN
which DET
are AUX
nearer ADJ
to ADP
the DET
solution NOUN
they PRON
are AUX
explored VERB
more ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
region NOUN
will VERB
be AUX
explored VERB
more ADV
the DET
regions NOUN
which DET
are AUX
in ADP
the DET
other ADJ
directions NOUN
are AUX
not PART
explored VERB
that ADV
much ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
is AUX
the DET
advantage NOUN
of ADP
using VERB
this DET
method NOUN
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
get AUX
what PRON
will VERB
happen VERB
? PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
most ADJ
cases NOUN
where ADV
H NOUN
dash NOUN
underestimates VERB
this DET
you PRON
probably ADV
will VERB
not PART
get AUX
for ADP
the DET
first ADJ
time NOUN
because SCONJ
you PRON
've AUX
estimated VERB
to PART
be AUX
three NUM
but CCONJ
is AUX
actually ADV
six NUM
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
wo VERB
n’t PART
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
but CCONJ
then ADV
once SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
not PART
get AUX
it PRON
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
increment VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
can VERB
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
node NOUN
so ADV
far ADV
and CCONJ
use VERB
that DET
thing NOUN
as SCONJ
the DET
measure NOUN
and CCONJ
again ADV
try VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so SCONJ
you PRON
may VERB
continue VERB
doing VERB
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
Eventually ADV
you PRON
will VERB
be AUX
able ADJ
to PART
reach VERB
there ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
the DET
example NOUN
is AUX
shown VERB
in ADP
… PUNCT
in ADP
the DET
figure NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
white ADJ
node ADV
is AUX
the DET

node ADV
and CCONJ
the DET
red PROPN
node PROPN
is AUX
the DET

node ADV
and CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
the DET
green ADJ
nodes NOUN
which DET
are AUX
inside ADP
the DET
G PROPN
Plus PROPN
H. PROPN


 SPACE
So ADV
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
more ADJ
number NOUN

explored VERB
in ADP
the DET
right ADJ
direction NOUN
and CCONJ
less ADJ
number NOUN
of ADP
nodes NOUN
are AUX
explored VERB
in ADP
the DET
other ADJ
direction NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
the DET
second ADJ
iteration NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
more ADJ
search NOUN
space NOUN
is AUX
explored VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that DET
search NOUN
space NOUN
near ADV

the DET

is AUX
explored VERB
more ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
That DET
is AUX
the DET
power NOUN
of ADP
IDA PROPN
star NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
more ADJ
number NOUN

green ADJ

red NOUN
node ADV
in ADP
both DET

, PUNCT
more ADJ

case NOUN
two NUM

the DET
other ADJ

get VERB
their DET
H NOUN
dash NOUN
H NOUN
value NOUN
higher ADJ
in ADP
a DET
much ADV
faster ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
need VERB

them PRON
more ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
you PRON
can VERB
see VERB
that DET

the DET

A DET

----------------
Why ADV
this DET

preferred VERB
in ADP
some DET
cases NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
uses VERB
optimized ADJ

and CCONJ
the DET

we PRON

then ADV
we PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
do AUX

----------------
We PRON
’ll VERB
just ADV
increment VERB

I PRON
said VERB
that SCONJ
we PRON
just ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
so ADV

set VERB
that DET

value NOUN
and CCONJ
we PRON
'll VERB
start VERB
working VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
We PRON
might VERB
need VERB

do AUX
it PRON
in ADP
multiple ADJ

but CCONJ
if SCONJ

H NOUN

admissible ADJ
be AUX
sure ADJ
that SCONJ
we PRON
’ll VERB

----------------
We PRON
get VERB
an DET
optimal ADJ

and CCONJ
the DET
algorithm NOUN
is AUX
also ADV
shown VERB
on ADP
the DET
next ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
we PRON
call VERB
that DET
thing NOUN
limit NOUN
okay INTJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Limit NOUN

the DET

So ADV
that DET
limit NOUN
equal ADJ

H NOUN

Now ADV
you PRON
assume VERB
that SCONJ

you PRON

then ADV
that DET

the DET

the DET

you PRON

If SCONJ
we PRON

If SCONJ
it PRON

there PRON

a DET

Now ADV
best ADJ
so ADV
far ADV
node ADV
says VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
goal NOUN

four NUM

----------------
So ADV
then ADV
you PRON
increment VERB
that SCONJ

four NUM

five NUM
then ADV
again ADV

So ADV
that DET

If SCONJ

When ADV

you PRON

… PUNCT
it PRON

moving VERB
in ADP
the DET
right ADJ
direction NOUN
but CCONJ
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
real ADJ
sense NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
does AUX
n’t PART
really ADV

that DET

node ADV

that DET

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
just ADV
moving VERB
just ADV
jumping VERB
in ADP
all DET
directions NOUN
and CCONJ
based VERB
on ADP
our DET
G PROPN
plus CCONJ
H PROPN
dash NOUN
value NOUN
without ADP
really ADV
having VERB
the DET
idea NOUN
about ADP
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
nodes NOUN
are AUX
very ADV
well ADV
connected VERB
it PRON
takes VERB
hell NOUN
lot NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
because SCONJ
it PRON
has AUX

again ADV
look VERB
for ADP
all DET

though SCONJ
[ PUNCT
Indiscernible ADJ

will VERB

do AUX
it PRON
again ADV
and CCONJ
again ADV
because SCONJ
it PRON
wo VERB
n't PART
remember VERB
explored VERB
nodes NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
will VERB
take VERB
a DET
lot NOUN
of ADP

and CCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
better ADJ
for ADP
less ADV
connected ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON

well ADV
connected ADJ
, PUNCT
it PRON
will VERB
take VERB
a DET
lot NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
and CCONJ
that DET
… PUNCT
that DET
is AUX
not PART
very ADV
good ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
Unlike ADP
the DET
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
optimal ADJ
, PUNCT
the DET
admissible ADJ
function NOUN
does AUX
not PART
mean VERB
that SCONJ
this DET

the DET

The DET
next ADJ

recursive ADJ
best ADV
first ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’s VERB
like SCONJ
best ADV
first ADV
that SCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
already ADV
seen VERB
but CCONJ
with ADP
one NUM

. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
earlier ADJ
case NOUN
the DET
best ADJ
first ADJ
what PRON
we PRON
do AUX
is AUX
we PRON
only ADV
store VERB
the DET
complete ADJ

set NOUN
of ADP
unexplored ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
we PRON
store VERB
the DET
list NOUN
of ADP
explored VERB
nodes NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
if SCONJ
we PRON
generate VERB
a DET
new ADJ

which DET

an DET

node NOUN
, PUNCT
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
need VERB
to PART
worry VERB
about ADP
that DET
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’s VERB
kind ADV
of ADV
a DET
cycle NOUN
okay INTJ
so SCONJ
we PRON
will VERB
have AUX

stop VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
we PRON
skip VERB
unexplored ADJ

? PUNCT
----------------
Because SCONJ
we PRON
'll VERB
have AUX

find VERB
out ADP
the DET

out SCONJ

it PRON

then ADV
we PRON
'll VERB
have AUX

choose VERB
one NOUN
the DET
best ADJ
one NUM

it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
's AUX
why ADV
we PRON
did AUX
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
this DET
case NOUN
the DET
recursive NOUN
the DET
best ADJ
first ADJ
search NOUN
we PRON
do AUX
n't PART
do AUX
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
What PRON
we PRON
do AUX
is AUX
we PRON
only ADV
pick VERB
the DET
best ADJ
… PUNCT
keep VERB
the DET
best ADV
unexplored ADJ

only ADV
explore VERB
that DET
and CCONJ
when ADV
you PRON

actually ADV
whenever ADV
I PRON

my DET

I PRON
find VERB
that SCONJ
no DET

better ADJ

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
there PRON
is AUX
no DET
children NOUN
better ADJ

the DET

what PRON
you PRON
do AUX
is AUX
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
so ADV

. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
the DET
best ADJ
so ADV
far ADV
the DET
second ADJ
best ADJ
will VERB
be AUX
the DET
best ADJ
child NOUN
, PUNCT
whatever DET
the DET
best ADJ

that DET
you PRON
have AUX
because SCONJ
you PRON
do AUX
n't PART
have AUX
any DET
other ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET
is AUX
pick VERB
up ADP
as SCONJ
second ADV
best ADJ
and CCONJ
you PRON
explore VERB
this DET
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV
you PRON
explore VERB
this DET
you PRON
find VERB
that SCONJ
these DET
children NOUN
are AUX
much ADV
higher ADJ
value NOUN
than SCONJ
this DET
and CCONJ
you PRON
pick VERB
up ADP
this DET
and CCONJ
start VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
at ADP
this DET
point NOUN
of ADP
time NOUN
the DET
best ADJ
child NOUN
of ADP
this DET
becomes VERB
the DET
second ADJ
best ADJ
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
you PRON
only ADV
keep VERB
two NUM
values NOUN
best ADV
and CCONJ
the DET
second ADJ
best ADJ
and CCONJ
whenever ADV
you PRON
move VERB

one NUM

the DET
other ADJ

the DET
best ADJ

second ADV

and CCONJ
whatever DET

move NOUN
… PUNCT
you PRON
move VERB

becomes VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
that DET

how ADV
it PRON
proceeds VERB
further ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Like SCONJ
the DET
other ADJ
case NOUN
IDA PROPN

case NOUN
it PRON

like SCONJ
normal ADJ

first ADJ

okay ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
best ADJ

but CCONJ
second ADV

preserved VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
wo VERB
n’t PART
preserve VERB
all DET
other ADJ

only ADV
second ADV
best ADJ
and CCONJ
if SCONJ
the DET

all DET

to PART
be AUX
worse ADJ
, PUNCT
the DET
search NOUN
process NOUN
backtracks VERB
to ADP
the DET
second ADJ
best ADJ
okay INTJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV
forth ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
have AUX
already ADV
discussed VERB
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
with ADP
that SCONJ
we PRON

we PRON
have AUX
studied VERB
two NUM
things NOUN
- PUNCT
IDA PROPN
star NOUN
and CCONJ
recursive VERB
best ADV
first ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
Both DET

, PUNCT
both DET

them PRON
are AUX
good ADJ
searches NOUN
for ADP
space NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
whenever ADV
there PRON

an DET
issue NOUN
with ADP
space NOUN
, PUNCT
either CCONJ

the DET
algorithm NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
otherwise ADV
they PRON
are AUX
not PART
good ADJ
algorithms NOUN
for ADP
cases NOUN
where ADV
the DET
time NOUN
is AUX
paramount ADJ
in ADP
most ADJ
cases NOUN
it PRON

so ADV
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
in ADP
that DET
case NOUN
some DET
other ADJ
algorithm NOUN
is AUX
used VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
In ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
there PRON
are AUX
many ADJ

many ADJ

, PUNCT
instead ADV
of ADP
just ADV
keeping VERB
one NUM

you PRON
just ADV

the DET

which DET

in ADP
the DET

is AUX
one NUM

there PRON
are AUX
a DET

----------------
But CCONJ
anyway INTJ
this DET
both CCONJ
the DET

give VERB
us PRON
a DET
very ADV
good ADJ
idea NOUN
about ADP
what PRON
people NOUN
can VERB
do AUX
when ADV
there PRON
is AUX
a DET
space NOUN
constraint NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
, PUNCT
in ADP
fact NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
is AUX
quite ADV
possible ADJ
that SCONJ
there PRON
are AUX
other ADJ
algorithms NOUN
and CCONJ
there PRON

other ADJ

which DET

generated VERB
from ADP
some DET
other ADJ
cases NOUN
which DET

the DET
characteristics NOUN

these DET
two NUM
algorithm NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
This DET
two NUM
always ADV

not PART
used VERB
in ADP
serious ADJ

, PUNCT
but CCONJ
some DET
other ADJ
algorithms NOUN
are AUX
inherited VERB

this DET
algorithm NOUN
which DET
are AUX
actually ADV
used VERB
in ADP
practice NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
next ADJ

that DET
we PRON
are AUX
going VERB
to PART
look VERB
at ADP
in ADP
this DET
particular ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
Now ADV
what PRON
are AUX
agents NOUN
? PUNCT
----------------
Agents NOUN
are AUX
software NOUN

----------------
A DET

agent NOUN
for ADP
example NOUN
is AUX
a DET
manual ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
what PRON
you PRON
do AUX
is AUX
you PRON
said VERB
I PRON
want VERB
to PART
move VERB
from ADP
Ahmedabad PROPN

Mumbai PROPN
on ADP
this DET

and CCONJ
I PRON
would VERB
prefer VERB
a DET
second ADJ
AC PROPN
so ADV
get AUX
me PRON
a DET
ticket NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
I PRON
will VERB
do AUX
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
’ll VERB
look VERB

, PUNCT
look VERB

and CCONJ
all DET
that DET
look VERB

my DET

I PRON

, PUNCT
I PRON
’ll VERB
require VERB
three NUM
AC PROPN
  SPACE
and CCONJ
so ADV
on ADV
so ADV

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
whatever DET
the DET

, PUNCT
it PRON
’ll VERB
book NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
that DET

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
provide VERB
your DET

, PUNCT
you PRON

what PRON
you PRON
want VERB

do AUX
and CCONJ
agent NOUN
does AUX
that DET
thing NOUN

you PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
agents NOUN
are AUX
the DET
programs NOUN
which DET

on ADP
user NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
probably ADV

… PUNCT
I PRON
have AUX
started VERB
talking VERB

… PUNCT
suddenly ADV
jump VERB

an DET

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
we PRON
so ADV
far ADV
has AUX
talked VERB
about ADP
AI PROPN
and CCONJ
programs NOUN
which DET

difficult ADJ
and CCONJ

, PUNCT
neural ADJ

many ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
And CCONJ
we PRON
have AUX
not PART
yet ADV
talked VERB

now ADV
and CCONJ
we PRON
're AUX
just ADV
jumping VERB

What PRON

the DET

? PUNCT
----------------
Why ADV
we PRON
're AUX
talking VERB

----------------
Anyway INTJ
, PUNCT
when ADV
we PRON
talk VERB

a DET

Eventually ADV
the DET

in ADP
real ADJ

… PUNCT
connect VERB

actually ADV

----------------
And CCONJ
if SCONJ
you PRON
want VERB
it PRON
to PART
work VERB
that DET
way NOUN
, PUNCT
the DET
concept NOUN
of ADP
agent NOUN

----------------
Because SCONJ

----------------
Okay INTJ
, PUNCT
so ADV
that DET

basically ADV
the DET

The DET
only ADJ

----------------
We PRON

So ADV
far ADV
we PRON
just ADV

But CCONJ
we PRON

What PRON

For ADP

it PRON

so ADV

So ADV
it PRON

basically ADV
an DET

This DET

not PART
only ADV
a DET

also ADV

these DET

the DET

So ADV

they PRON

Another DET

So ADV
whenever ADV

it PRON
uses VERB
something PRON
called VERB
actuator NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
When ADV

the DET
world NOUN
, PUNCT
it PRON
uses VERB
something PRON

----------------
So ADV

two NUM

Sensors NOUN
which DET

----------------
the DET

So ADV
, PUNCT
agent NOUN

----------------
So ADV

How ADV
agent NOUN

? PUNCT
----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
an DET
intrusion NOUN
detection NOUN
agent NOUN
look VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
looks VERB

----------------
If SCONJ

it PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON

not PART
an DET

it PRON
let VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
the DET

is AUX
called VERB

----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
there PRON

the DET

So CCONJ
, PUNCT
if SCONJ
… PUNCT
what PRON
does AUX
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET

do AUX
in ADP
this DET

----------------
It PRON
looks VERB

the DET

----------------
It PRON
decides VERB
that SCONJ
this DET

and CCONJ
it PRON

----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON

not PART

it PRON
’ll VERB
let VERB

----------------
Now ADV
, PUNCT
it PRON

not PART
lead VERB

look VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
only ADV

Now ADV
there PRON

a DET

On ADP
one NUM

if SCONJ

fifty NUM

now ADV
that DET

a DET

Now ADV
that DET

something PRON
very ADV
different ADJ
and CCONJ
I PRON
want VERB

capture VERB
such ADJ

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
I PRON
start VERB
running VERB
an DET
agent NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
agent NOUN
does AUX
what PRON
? PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
… PUNCT
Can VERB
it PRON
only ADV
look VERB

----------------
It PRON
can VERB
not PART
it PRON

----------------
When ADV
it PRON

that DET

it PRON
’ll VERB
see VERB
that SCONJ
it PRON
crossing VERB
value NOUN
fifty NUM
it PRON
let VERB

----------------
Okay INTJ
you PRON
can VERB
decide VERB
that DET
value NOUN
it PRON
is AUX
fifty NUM

ten NUM

five NUM
whatever DET

----------------
But CCONJ
here ADV
the DET
difference NOUN
is AUX
that SCONJ
it PRON

look VERB

not PART
one NUM
current ADJ

previous ADJ
percepts NOUN

well ADV
as SCONJ
well ADV
and CCONJ
that DET

called VERB
percept NOUN
sequence NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
So CCONJ
… PUNCT
so ADV
agent NOUN
can VERB
take VERB
decision NOUN
based VERB

current ADJ
percept NOUN
which DET

simpler ADJ
agent NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
Agent NOUN
may VERB
take VERB

. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
and CCONJ
conventional ADJ
old ADJ
intrusion NOUN

you PRON
… PUNCT
were AUX
like SCONJ
virus NOUN

. PUNCT
----------------
You PRON
just ADV
look VERB
at ADP
the DET

and CCONJ
it PRON
finds VERB
that SCONJ
the DET
… PUNCT
the DET
packet NOUN
contains VERB
something PRON
which DET
raises VERB
the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
It PRON
says VERB
that SCONJ
suspiciousness NOUN
and CCONJ
then ADV
it PRON
just ADV
pick VERB
up ADP
that DET
thing NOUN
and CCONJ
drop VERB
it PRON
. PUNCT
----------------
Okay INTJ
so ADV
just ADV
looking VERB
at ADP
the DET
current ADJ
percept NOUN
it PRON
decides VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
it PRON
is AUX
not PART
found VERB
that DET
let VERB
it PRON
go VERB
. PUNCT
----------------
But CCONJ
then ADV
as SCONJ
I PRON
said VERB
there PRON
's AUX
a DET
simpler ADJ
methods NOUN
. PUNCT
----------------
The DET
signature NOUN
recognition NOUN
is AUX
… PUNCT
is AUX
always ADV
based VERB
on ADP
current ADJ
percept NOUN
but CCONJ
then ADV
there PRON

a DET
state NOUN
full ADJ
kind NOUN

a DET

where ADV
it PRON

multiple ADJ

, PUNCT
knows VERB
what PRON

happened VERB
before ADV
and CCONJ
all DET
that DET
. PUNCT
----------------
So SCONJ
it PRON
remembers VERB
all DET
that DET
percept VERB
sequence NOUN
and CCONJ
take VERB
a DET
decision NOUN
is AUX
a DET
complex ADJ
case NOUN
and CCONJ
sometimes ADV
you PRON
… PUNCT
you PRON

make VERB
sure ADJ
that SCONJ

the DET

. PUNCT
----------------
If SCONJ
there PRON

inconsistency NOUN
you PRON
just ADV
report VERB

----------------
For ADP
example NOUN
, PUNCT
as SCONJ
a DET
normal ADJ

I PRON

I PRON
just ADV

all DET

and CCONJ
that DET

something PRON

. PUNCT
----------------
So ADV
, PUNCT
that DET
kind NOUN
of ADP
thing NOUN
also ADV
can VERB
be AUX
looked VERB
at ADP
, PUNCT
but CCONJ
for ADP
that DET
I PRON
need VERB

find VERB
out ADP
the DET
normal ADJ

  SPACE
so ADV
for ADP
which DET

probably ADV
a DET

sometimes ADV
even ADV
a DET

to PART
figure VERB
out ADP
what PRON
the DET

----------------
So ADV
for ADP
that DET
this DET

----------------
There PRON

Now ADV

how ADV
