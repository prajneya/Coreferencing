Hello NNP
friends NNS
, ,
welcome JJ
to IN
Module NNP
Five CD
, ,
Heuristic NNP
Search NNP
Methods NNPS
in IN
Artificial NNP
Intelligence NNP
studies NNS
of IN
modules NNS
. .
----------------
We PRP
’ve VB
already RB
seen VBN
that IN
it PRP
is VBZ
possible JJ
to TO
represent VB
the DT
problem NN
using VBG
state NN
space NN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’ve VB
already RB
seen VBN
that IN
there EX
is VBZ
possibility NN
of IN
using VBG
something NN
called VBN
blind JJ
search NN
methods NNS
like IN
kit NN
generate NN
and CC
test NN
, ,
breadth NN
- HYPH
first JJ
search NN
, ,
depth NN
- HYPH
first JJ
search NN
to TO
handle VB
the DT
search NN
problem NN
. .
----------------
But CC
the DT
problem NN
with IN
these DT
methods NNS
that WDT
is RB
, ,
is VBZ
going VBG
to TO
enter VB
into IN
entangled VBN
into IN
something NN
called VBN
combinatorial JJ
explosion NN
. .
----------------
Combinatorial JJ
explosion NN
is VBZ
number NN
of IN
options NNS
that WDT
you PRP
have VBP
. .
----------------
In IN
the DT
previous JJ
module NN
, ,
we PRP
have VBP
seen VBN
simple JJ
eight CD
, ,
five CD
, ,
three CD
gallon NN
water NN
jug NN
problem NN
where WRB
we PRP
have VBP
only RB
few JJ
nodes NNS
to TO
explore VB
and CC
we PRP
could MD
get VB
the DT
answer NN
. .
----------------
But CC
let VB
us PRP
again RB
pick VB
up RP
a DT
problem NN
like IN
chess NN
and CC
it PRP
becomes VBZ
impossible JJ
for IN
us PRP
to TO
get VB
an DT
answer NN
. .
----------------
There EX
are VBP
so RB
many JJ
other JJ
problems NNS
which WDT
we PRP
can MD
talk VB
about IN
where WRB
we PRP
can MD
see VB
that IN
even RB
a DT
trivial JJ
problem NN
like IN
traveling VBG
salesman NN
result VB
into IN
a DT
serious JJ
combinatorial JJ
explosion NN
. .
----------------
You PRP
can MD
not RB
solve VB
the DT
problem NN
in IN
real JJ
time NN
. .
----------------
And CC
we PRP
have VBP
already RB
seen VBN
that IN
it PRP
is VBZ
possible JJ
to TO
learn VB
from IN
the DT
domain NN
which WDT
moves NNS
are VBP
better JJR
than IN
others NNS
. .
----------------
And CC
if IN
you PRP
can MD
somehow RB
manage VB
that IN
it PRP
becomes VBZ
easier JJR
for IN
us PRP
to TO
choose VB
moves NNS
which WDT
are VBP
better JJR
and CC
complete VB
the DT
search NN
process NN
in IN
real JJ
time NN
. .
----------------
So RB
that DT
’s VBZ
precisely RB
the DT
theme NN
of IN
this DT
particular JJ
module NN
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
so RB
let VB
us PRP
see VB
what WP
heuristic JJ
search NN
methods NNS
have VBP
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
let VB
us PRP
begin VB
with IN
the DT
introduction NN
of IN
something NN
called VBN
heuristic JJ
function NN
is VBZ
a DT
function NN
which WDT
is VBZ
applied VBN
to IN
a DT
state NN
. .
----------------
Now RB
, ,
if IN
you PRP
ask VBP
a DT
chess NN
player NN
given VBN
a DT
board NN
position NN
, ,
two CD
board NN
positions NNS
which WDT
one PRP
is VBZ
better JJR
, ,
he PRP
would MD
say VB
this DT
is VBZ
better JJR
or CC
that DT
is VBZ
better JJR
. .
----------------
Well UH
, ,
how WRB
better RBR
, ,
how WRB
much JJ
there RB
the DT
quantitative JJ
representation NN
then RB
they PRP
’re VBP
not RB
be VB
able JJ
to TO
view VB
but CC
here RB
we PRP
’re VBP
thinking VBG
that DT
way NN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’re VBP
going VBG
to TO
have VB
a DT
quantitative JJ
representation NN
of IN
goodness NN
of IN
the DT
state NN
. .
----------------
We PRP
call VBP
it PRP
the DT
heuristic JJ
function NN
response NN
or CC
the DT
answer NN
. .
----------------
So RB
what WP
does VBZ
that DT
mean VB
? .
----------------
I PRP
’m VBP
given VBN
a DT
chess NN
board NN
position NN
, ,
I PRP
apply VBP
that IN
heuristic JJ
function NN
, ,
that IN
heuristic JJ
function NN
will MD
give VB
you PRP
– :
give VB
me PRP
a DT
value NN
between IN
minus CC
ten CD
and CC
ten CD
. .
----------------
Minus CC
ten CD
is VBZ
a DT
defeat NN
from IN
me PRP
, ,
ten NN
is VBZ
a DT
win NN
for IN
me PRP
and CC
the DT
value NN
between IN
minus CC
ten CD
to IN
ten CD
indicates VBZ
the DT
merit NN
of IN
that DT
particular JJ
state NN
, ,
how WRB
good JJ
or CC
bad JJ
that IN
state NN
is VBZ
. .
----------------
So RB
you PRP
can MD
see VB
. .
----------------
It PRP
is VBZ
about RB
using VBG
domain NN
knowledge NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
What WP
the DT
heuristic JJ
function NN
take VBP
as IN
an DT
input NN
? .
----------------
The DT
problem NN
state NN
. .
----------------
And CC
what WP
it PRP
comes VBZ
out RP
with IN
is VBZ
the DT
value NN
, ,
okay UH
, ,
how WRB
good JJ
or CC
bad JJ
but CC
ten CD
, ,
minus CC
ten CD
to IN
ten CD
in IN
conventional JJ
way NN
but CC
you PRP
can MD
design VB
your PRP$
own JJ
way NN
. .
----------------
There EX
is VBZ
no DT
standard NN
as IN
such JJ
. .
----------------
And CC
here RB
Farmer NNP
Fox NNP
Chicken NNP
Grain NNP
problem NN
. .
----------------
Suppose VB
if IN
I PRP
design VBP
a DT
heuristic JJ
function NN
for IN
Farmer NNP
Fox NNP
Chicken NNP
Grain NNP
problem NN
for IN
this DT
assume NN
that IN
there EX
is VBZ
a DT
function NN
exist VB
. .
----------------
It PRP
says VBZ
everybody NN
is VBZ
on IN
the DT
left JJ
hand NN
side NN
, ,
nothing NN
, ,
nobody NN
is VBZ
on IN
the DT
left JJ
hand NN
side NN
, ,
everybody NN
is VBZ
on IN
the DT
right JJ
hand NN
side NN
. .
----------------
And CC
what WP
does VBZ
that DT
mean VB
? .
----------------
That DT
means VBZ
that IN
it PRP
is VBZ
ten CD
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
win NN
for IN
us PRP
, ,
the DT
problem NN
is VBZ
solved VBN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
In IN
missionary JJ
cannibal JJ
case NN
sorry UH
it PRP
’s VBZ
milk NN
jug NN
problem NN
sorry UH
it PRP
’s VBZ
zero CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
zero CD
minus NN
ten CD
. .
----------------
What WP
does VBZ
that DT
mean VB
? .
----------------
If IN
I PRP
have VBP
nothing NN
left VBN
in IN
all DT
jugs NNS
then RB
something NN
terribly RB
wrong JJ
. .
----------------
Minus CC
ten CD
, ,
I PRP
’ll MD
not RB
[ -LRB-
Indiscernible JJ
] -RRB-
[ -LRB-
00:03:33 NNP
] -RRB-
solution NN
after IN
this DT
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So CC
is VBZ
it PRP
kind RB
of RB
a DT
dead JJ
end NN
or CC
loss NN
, ,
okay UH
, ,
a DT
failure NN
. .
----------------
So RB
these DT
are VBP
examples NNS
. .
----------------
But CC
a DT
more RBR
important JJ
thing NN
is VBZ
I PRP
must MD
have VB
some DT
clear JJ
means NNS
of IN
telling VBG
which WDT
move NN
is VBZ
better JJR
. .
----------------
For IN
example NN
, ,
we PRP
have VBP
assumed VBN
that IN
eight CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
zero CD
is VBZ
the DT
beginning NN
this DT
thing NN
a DT
move NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
For IN
example NN
, ,
I PRP
’m VBP
at IN
a DT
typical JJ
place NN
in IN
eight CD
, ,
zero CD
– :
eight CD
, ,
five CD
, ,
three CD
gallon NN
water NN
jug NN
problem NN
. .
----------------
I PRP
have VBP
few JJ
moves NNS
possible JJ
. .
----------------
I PRP
can MD
move VB
to IN
eight CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
zero CD
. .
----------------
I PRP
can MD
move VB
to IN
six CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
two CD
. .
----------------
I PRP
can MD
move VB
to IN
three CD
, ,
five CD
, ,
zero CD
and CC
I PRP
can MD
move VB
to IN
three CD
, ,
two CD
, ,
three CD
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
And CC
suppose VB
if IN
my PRP$
heuristic JJ
function NN
says VBZ
that IN
eight CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
zero CD
’s POS
heuristic JJ
value NN
is VBZ
minus RB
five CD
, ,
eight CD
, ,
six CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
two CD
is VBZ
five CD
. .
----------------
Three CD
, ,
five CD
, ,
zero CD
is VBZ
three CD
and CC
three CD
, ,
two CD
, ,
three CD
is VBZ
four CD
. .
----------------
Now RB
, ,
it PRP
clearly RB
indicates VBZ
that IN
six CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
two CD
is VBZ
better JJR
than IN
others NNS
. .
----------------
So RB
what WP
should MD
I PRP
choose VB
? .
----------------
I PRP
just RB
choose VBP
six CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
two CD
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So CC
this DT
is VBZ
how WRB
I PRP
can MD
apply VB
heuristic JJ
function NN
and CC
get VB
the DT
move NN
that WDT
I PRP
should MD
choose VB
rather RB
than IN
exploring VBG
all DT
of IN
them PRP
like IN
breadth NN
- HYPH
first JJ
or CC
exploring VBG
one CD
branch NN
and CC
then RB
the DT
second JJ
branch NN
and CC
the DT
third JJ
branch NN
like IN
DFS NNP
. .
----------------
I PRP
’m VBP
not RB
doing VBG
it PRP
blindly RB
and CC
that DT
’s VBZ
why WRB
this DT
is VBZ
called VBN
guided VBN
search NN
and CC
not RB
blind JJ
search NN
or CC
unguided JJ
search NN
. .
----------------
Anyway UH
, ,
there EX
are VBP
two CD
problems NNS
. .
----------------
And CC
there EX
is VBZ
two CD
questions NNS
that WDT
you PRP
’d MD
probably RB
ask VB
before IN
we PRP
proceed VBP
further RB
. .
----------------
First RB
, ,
how WRB
to TO
write VB
this DT
function NN
? .
----------------
Important JJ
one CD
. .
----------------
Second RB
, ,
if IN
this DT
function NN
, ,
suppose VB
if IN
you PRP
know VBP
how WRB
to TO
write VB
this DT
for IN
them PRP
, ,
how WRB
you PRP
put VBP
this DT
function NN
to TO
use VB
. .
----------------
In IN
fact NN
, ,
the DT
second JJ
answer NN
is VBZ
easy JJ
to TO
– :
the DT
second JJ
question NN
is VBZ
easy JJ
to TO
answer VB
. .
----------------
If IN
I PRP
have VBP
this DT
function NN
I PRP
can MD
just RB
apply VB
to IN
a DT
state NN
and CC
get VB
that DT
value NN
and CC
get VB
that DT
value NN
between IN
minus CC
ten CD
and CC
ten CD
and CC
I PRP
’ll MD
look VB
at IN
all DT
possible JJ
alternatives NNS
. .
----------------
Suppose VB
, ,
if IN
I PRP
’m VBP
here RB
and CC
I PRP
have VBP
five CD
different JJ
moves NNS
from IN
this DT
I PRP
’ll MD
apply VB
this DT
function NN
to IN
all DT
of IN
them PRP
. .
----------------
The DT
side NN
which WDT
one PRP
gives VBZ
me PRP
the DT
better RBR
heuristic JJ
value NN
and CC
we PRP
’ll MD
choose VB
that DT
, ,
that DT
’s VBZ
simple JJ
and CC
okay UH
. .
----------------
But CC
that DT
’s VBZ
not RB
that RB
simple JJ
, ,
we PRP
’ll MD
see VB
how WRB
, ,
how WRB
, ,
how WRB
to TO
proceed VB
using VBG
that DT
. .
----------------
But CC
that DT
is VBZ
precisely RB
what WP
we PRP
’re VBP
supposed VBN
to TO
do VB
and CC
that DT
’s VBZ
the DT
theme NN
of IN
this DT
chapter NN
. .
----------------
The DT
first JJ
part NN
how WRB
to TO
write VB
this DT
function NN
actually RB
depends VBZ
on IN
the DT
domain NN
. .
----------------
And CC
that DT
’s VBZ
the DT
reason NN
why WRB
we PRP
’re VBP
not RB
going VBG
to TO
discuss VB
much JJ
about IN
this DT
. .
----------------
But CC
if IN
you PRP
know VBP
how WRB
to TO
and CC
there EX
are VBP
some DT
books NNS
available JJ
on IN
how WRB
to TO
write VB
heuristic JJ
function NN
for IN
a DT
given VBN
domain NN
like IN
chess NN
. .
----------------
So IN
we PRP
can MD
choose VB
the DT
book NN
that WDT
suits VBZ
your PRP$
domain NN
, ,
look VB
for IN
heuristic JJ
function NN
or CC
try VB
writing VBG
for IN
yourself PRP
but CC
otherwise RB
it PRP
’s VBZ
simple JJ
. .
----------------
If IN
you PRP
know VBP
how WRB
to TO
write VB
heuristic JJ
function NN
whatever WDT
we PRP
’re VBP
going VBG
to TO
talk VB
about IN
is VBZ
perfectly RB
all RB
right JJ
. .
----------------
Even RB
if IN
you PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
know VB
it PRP
’s VBZ
still RB
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
we PRP
’ll MD
look VB
at IN
the DT
first JJ
method NN
and CC
that DT
method NN
is VBZ
again RB
pretty RB
simple JJ
. .
----------------
What WP
I PRP
do VBP
is VBZ
I PRP
’m VBP
here RB
in IN
this DT
state NN
, ,
I PRP
just RB
apply VBP
one CD
rule NN
that WDT
is VBZ
possible JJ
to TO
be VB
applied VBN
in IN
this DT
generate NN
the DT
node NN
. .
----------------
If IN
this DT
node NN
is VBZ
better JJR
than IN
this DT
I PRP
’ll MD
just RB
go VB
, ,
that DT
’s VBZ
called VBN
hill NN
climbing NN
. .
----------------
Why WRB
it PRP
’s VBZ
called VBN
hill NN
climbing NN
? .
----------------
I PRP
’m VBP
actually RB
incrementing VBG
the DT
heuristic JJ
value NN
. .
----------------
If IN
my PRP$
current JJ
node NN
’s POS
heuristic JJ
value NN
is VBZ
three CD
, ,
I PRP
get VBP
a DT
node NN
with IN
heuristic JJ
value NN
five CD
I PRP
just RB
move VBP
. .
----------------
And CC
then RB
from IN
five CD
I PRP
get VBP
seven CD
, ,
I PRP
move VBP
, ,
a DT
seven CD
, ,
eight CD
I PRP
can MD
move VB
up RB
and CC
so RB
on RB
. .
----------------
What WP
my PRP$
requirement NN
is VBZ
to TO
reach VB
to IN
ten CD
. .
----------------
I PRP
’ve VB
already RB
told VBN
you PRP
ten NN
is VBZ
the DT
solution NN
, ,
okay UH
, ,
so IN
that DT
’s VBZ
why WRB
it PRP
’s VBZ
called VBN
hill NN
climbing NN
. .
----------------
So RB
the DT
algorithm NN
is VBZ
shown VBN
on IN
the DT
screen NN
, ,
pick VB
up RP
the DT
start NN
and CC
make VB
it PRP
current JJ
node RB
, ,
okay UH
, ,
so RB
it PRP
’s VBZ
simple JJ
. .
----------------
Pick VB
up RP
the DT
start NN
node RB
, ,
it PRP
’s VBZ
the DT
current JJ
node UH
if IN
it PRP
’s VBZ
the DT
goal NN
, ,
great JJ
, ,
you PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
need VB
to TO
do VB
anything NN
. .
----------------
It PRP
is VBZ
not RB
fine JJ
, ,
go VB
further RB
. .
----------------
Look VB
at IN
all DT
possible JJ
rules NNS
to TO
be VB
applied VBN
. .
----------------
Apply VB
the DT
first JJ
rule NN
, ,
if IN
it PRP
is VBZ
better RBR
go VB
to IN
that DT
node RB
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
Generate VB
new JJ
state NN
by IN
applying VBG
next JJ
rule NN
, ,
no DT
rule NN
is VBZ
left VBN
. .
----------------
If IN
you PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
have VB
from IN
this DT
particular JJ
state NN
there EX
are VBP
no DT
rules NNS
possible JJ
you PRP
ca MD
n’t RB
go VB
further RBR
is VBZ
a DT
dead JJ
end NN
. .
----------------
Say VB
, ,
you PRP
can MD
not RB
move VB
. .
----------------
Okay UH
. .
----------------
Apply VB
heuristic JJ
function NN
, ,
see VB
which WDT
one NN
is VBZ
better JJR
. .
----------------
If IN
it PRP
is VBZ
better RB
go VB
ahead RB
. .
----------------
Now RB
you PRP
can MD
see VB
this DT
example NN
. .
----------------
This DT
figure NN
actually RB
talks VBZ
about IN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’d MD
begin VB
with IN
a DT
state NN
with IN
heuristic JJ
value NN
minus NN
three CD
. .
----------------
We PRP
apply VBP
for IN
a DT
stool NN
, ,
we PRP
get VBP
minus RB
five CD
. .
----------------
Can MD
we PRP
move VB
? .
----------------
We PRP
can MD
not RB
because IN
this DT
particular JJ
node NN
has VBZ
lesser JJR
heuristic JJ
value NN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’d MD
like VB
to TO
have VB
a DT
better RBR
heuristic JJ
value NN
so IN
we PRP
’ll MD
not RB
move VB
further RB
. .
----------------
Next JJ
one CD
is VBZ
minus CC
four CD
. .
----------------
This DT
also RB
is VBZ
not RB
very RB
good JJ
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
This DT
is VBZ
not RB
better JJR
than IN
the DT
current JJ
one NN
so IN
we PRP
’ll MD
not RB
move VB
. .
----------------
Zero NNP
is VBZ
better JJR
than IN
minus RB
three CD
so RB
we PRP
’ll MD
pick VB
up RP
that DT
. .
----------------
Now RB
the DT
first JJ
node NN
that WDT
we PRP
generate VBP
is VBZ
minus RB
one CD
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
obviously RB
not RB
as RB
good JJ
. .
----------------
But CC
the DT
other JJ
one NN
when WRB
you PRP
apply VBP
the DT
second JJ
rule NN
, ,
the DT
state NN
that WDT
we PRP
get VBP
has VBZ
value NN
two CD
so RB
we PRP
move VBP
to IN
two CD
. .
----------------
Then RB
we PRP
apply VBP
the DT
first JJ
rule NN
which WDT
makes VBZ
it PRP
four CD
so RB
this DT
state NN
is VBZ
good JJ
so IN
we PRP
move VBP
to IN
four CD
. .
----------------
Then RB
we PRP
have VBP
two CD
options NNS
. .
----------------
One CD
is VBZ
four CD
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
same JJ
so IN
we PRP
’ll MD
not RB
go VB
for IN
that DT
. .
----------------
Next JJ
one CD
is VBZ
ten CD
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
so CC
what WP
we PRP
do VBP
now RB
. .
----------------
We PRP
’ll MD
jump VB
to IN
ten CD
and CC
we PRP
got VBD
a DT
solution NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
This DT
is VBZ
called VBN
hill NN
climbing NN
. .
----------------
Sounds VBZ
simple JJ
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
. .
----------------
But CC
then RB
there EX
is VBZ
a DT
problem NN
. .
----------------
Look VB
at IN
this DT
typical JJ
case NN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’d MD
start VB
with IN
minus RB
three CD
. .
----------------
The DT
first JJ
node NN
is VBZ
minus RB
five CD
, ,
not RB
very RB
good JJ
. .
----------------
We PRP
have VBP
zero CD
this DT
is VBZ
better JJR
so IN
we PRP
move VBP
there RB
then RB
minus VBZ
one NN
not RB
good JJ
, ,
two CD
, ,
better JJR
, ,
go VB
there RB
, ,
four CD
, ,
we PRP
’re VBP
moving VBG
along IN
quite RB
nice JJ
, ,
okay UH
, ,
four CD
. .
----------------
But CC
then RB
there EX
is VBZ
a DT
problem NN
. .
----------------
There EX
are VBP
two CD
children NNS
neither DT
of IN
them PRP
has VBZ
better JJR
value NN
and CC
we PRP
’re VBP
stuck JJ
. .
----------------
We PRP
’re VBP
stuck JJ
, ,
we PRP
can MD
not RB
move VB
forward RB
and CC
we PRP
’re VBP
not RB
at IN
the DT
solution NN
. .
----------------
Remember VB
when WRB
we PRP
’re VBP
at IN
the DT
solution NN
when WRB
we PRP
get VBP
value NN
ten CD
. .
----------------
We PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
have VB
the DT
value NN
ten CD
. .
----------------
We PRP
get VBP
three CD
and CC
two CD
. .
----------------
So RB
none NN
of IN
them PRP
is VBZ
a DT
solution NN
but CC
we PRP
can MD
not RB
go VB
. .
----------------
So RB
that DT
is VBZ
the DT
problem NN
with IN
hill NN
climbing VBG
that IN
’s VBZ
called VBN
local JJ
maxima NNP
. .
----------------
Why WRB
it PRP
’s VBZ
called VBN
local JJ
? .
----------------
Because IN
we PRP
’re VBP
not RB
reached VBN
to IN
the DT
final JJ
goal NN
state NN
that WDT
’s VBZ
a DT
local JJ
surrounding NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
And CC
maximum JJ
is VBZ
it PRP
is VBZ
three CD
and CC
two CD
are VBP
lesser JJR
value NN
. .
----------------
So RB
what WP
you PRP
’re VBP
doing VBG
? .
----------------
You PRP
’re VBP
actually RB
you PRP
start VBP
with IN
minus RB
three CD
then RB
zero CD
then RB
two CD
then RB
four CD
. .
----------------
You PRP
’d MD
reach VB
to IN
four CD
. .
----------------
But CC
then RB
you PRP
ca MD
n’t RB
move VB
further RB
. .
----------------
It PRP
is VBZ
actually RB
mini JJ
maxima NNP
, ,
it PRP
’s VBZ
kind RB
of RB
a DT
hill NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
You PRP
reached VBD
to IN
four CD
you PRP
ca MD
n’t RB
move VB
further RB
, ,
okay UH
that DT
is VBZ
called VBN
local JJ
maxima NNP
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
There EX
is VBZ
something NN
called VBN
dead JJ
end VB
also RB
. .
----------------
You PRP
can MD
look VB
at IN
this DT
example NN
. .
----------------
Same JJ
three CD
, ,
zero CD
, ,
two CD
, ,
four CD
, ,
four CD
and CC
six CD
. .
----------------
Now RB
you PRP
choose VBP
six CD
but CC
then RB
there EX
are VBP
no DT
rules NNS
possible JJ
in IN
this DT
case NN
. .
----------------
It PRP
is VBZ
very RB
good JJ
rule NN
six CD
, ,
if IN
it PRP
’s VBZ
not RB
solution NN
but CC
then RB
there EX
are VBP
no DT
possible JJ
rules NNS
to TO
be VB
applied VBN
. .
----------------
When WRB
there EX
are VBP
no DT
possibility NN
of IN
applying VBG
any DT
rules NNS
we PRP
ca MD
n’t RB
move VB
further RB
. .
----------------
So RB
six CD
is VBZ
a DT
dead JJ
end NN
in IN
this DT
case NN
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
there EX
is VBZ
something NN
called VBN
steepest NNP
ascent NNP
hill NNP
climbing NN
which WDT
is VBZ
a DT
little JJ
different JJ
than IN
the DT
hill NN
climbing NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
What WP
does VBZ
it PRP
do VB
? .
----------------
Instead RB
of IN
picking VBG
up RP
one CD
rule NN
and CC
find VB
out RP
if IN
the DT
node NN
is VBZ
better JJR
, ,
what WP
it PRP
does VBZ
it PRP
explores VBZ
everyone NN
and CC
pick VB
up RP
the DT
best JJS
one CD
. .
----------------
You PRP
see VBP
the DT
example NN
, ,
minus CC
five CD
, ,
four CD
and CC
zero CD
for IN
three CD
. .
----------------
So RB
you PRP
pick VBP
up RP
four CD
, ,
again RB
, ,
pick VB
up RP
all DT
children NNS
are VBP
four CD
, ,
five CD
, ,
six CD
and CC
four CD
. .
----------------
We PRP
pick VBP
up RP
six CD
which WDT
is VBZ
best JJS
, ,
okay UH
, ,
this DT
is VBZ
what WP
we PRP
’re VBP
doing VBG
. .
----------------
We PRP
’re VBP
picking VBG
up RP
the DT
best JJS
child NN
. .
----------------
And CC
then RB
eight CD
and CC
then RB
ten CD
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So CC
this DT
is VBZ
what WP
is VBZ
known VBN
as IN
steepest NNP
ascent NNP
hill NNP
climbing NN
. .
----------------
Why WRB
it PRP
is VBZ
called VBN
steepest NNP
ascent NN
because IN
we PRP
’re VBP
looking VBG
at IN
all DT
possible JJ
nodes NNS
and CC
we PRP
’ll MD
pick VB
up RP
the DT
node NN
which WDT
gives VBZ
us PRP
steepest NN
ascent NN
, ,
will MD
give VB
us PRP
highest JJS
value NN
of IN
the DT
heuristic JJ
value NN
of IN
the DT
children NNS
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So RB
we PRP
’ll MD
choose VB
the DT
child NN
with IN
highest JJS
heuristic JJ
value NN
that WDT
’s VBZ
why WRB
it PRP
’s VBZ
called VBN
steepest NNP
ascent NN
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
the DT
next JJ
search NN
method NN
that WDT
we PRP
’re VBP
going VBG
to TO
use VB
, ,
we PRP
’re VBP
going VBG
to TO
talk VB
about IN
is VBZ
called VBN
best RBS
first JJ
search NN
. .
----------------
Now RB
this DT
is VBZ
little RB
different JJ
than IN
hill NN
climbing NN
, ,
a DT
little JJ
better JJR
than IN
hill NN
climbing VBG
in IN
some DT
sense NN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’ve VB
seen VBN
that IN
we PRP
entangled VBD
into IN
local JJ
maxima NNP
. .
----------------
If IN
we PRP
find VBP
that IN
on IN
a DT
children NNS
do VBP
n’t RB
have VB
the DT
value NN
better RBR
than IN
us PRP
, ,
what WP
should MD
we PRP
do VB
? .
----------------
Hill NN
climbing VBG
stops VBZ
there RB
, ,
right UH
. .
----------------
It PRP
fails VBZ
there RB
and CC
in IN
case NN
of IN
best JJS
first JJ
search NN
we PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
do VB
it PRP
. .
----------------
In IN
fact NN
, ,
it PRP
allows VBZ
you PRP
to TO
pick VB
up RP
the DT
best JJS
child NN
, ,
not RB
only RB
that DT
irrespective RB
of IN
the DT
parents NNS
value NN
. .
----------------
And CC
like IN
the DT
previous JJ
case NN
we PRP
have VBP
four CD
which WDT
has VBZ
two CD
and CC
three CD
and CC
you PRP
can MD
not RB
go VB
because IN
it PRP
’s VBZ
worst JJS
. .
----------------
In IN
case NN
of IN
best RBS
first RB
, ,
you PRP
can MD
even RB
pick VB
up RP
three CD
. .
----------------
Not RB
only RB
that DT
, ,
you PRP
can MD
even RB
go VB
ahead RB
and CC
pick VB
up RP
some DT
other JJ
brands NNS
, ,
some DT
other JJ
node NN
which WDT
is VBZ
better JJR
than IN
three CD
, ,
you PRP
can MD
do VB
it PRP
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
so CC
that DT
is VBZ
what WP
best JJS
first JJ
search NN
is VBZ
. .
----------------
In IN
fact NN
, ,
best RBS
first JJ
search NN
you PRP
have VBP
three CD
different JJ
types NNS
of IN
nodes NNS
. .
----------------
First RB
, ,
which WDT
are VBP
already RB
explored VBN
. .
----------------
Second RB
, ,
which WDT
are VBP
yet RB
to TO
be VB
explored VBN
and CC
the DT
third JJ
which WDT
we PRP
’re VBP
considering VBG
right RB
now RB
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
The DT
candidates NNS
for IN
that DT
thing NN
so RB
they PRP
’re VBP
best RBS
actually RB
and CC
so RB
we PRP
’re VBP
always RB
looking VBG
at IN
best JJS
nodes NNS
. .
----------------
So RB
that IN
there EX
are VBP
three CD
one CD
is VBZ
listed VBN
on IN
the DT
slide NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So RB
what WP
we PRP
have VBP
is VBZ
this DT
. .
----------------
Pick VB
up RP
the DT
start NN
node RB
and CC
make VB
it PRP
current JJ
, ,
okay UH
, ,
the DT
start NN
node RB
and CC
take VB
up RP
all DT
nodes NNS
, ,
pick VB
and CC
store VB
them PRP
in IN
the DT
heuristic JJ
sorted JJ
order NN
of IN
heuristic JJ
value NN
. .
----------------
So RB
what WP
we PRP
have VBP
the DT
best JJS
node NN
on IN
the DT
top NN
. .
----------------
Now RB
we PRP
’re VBP
not RB
looking VBG
at IN
the DT
children NNS
. .
----------------
We PRP
’re VBP
looking VBG
at IN
just RB
all DT
nodes NNS
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
We PRP
explore VBP
the DT
top NN
when WRB
we PRP
get VBP
all DT
nodes NNS
, ,
we PRP
apply VBP
heuristic JJ
values NNS
to IN
them PRP
, ,
add VB
them PRP
in IN
the DT
array NN
and CC
again RB
pick VB
up RP
that IN
node RB
from IN
the DT
top NN
. .
----------------
All DT
explored VBN
nodes NNS
are VBP
kept VBN
in IN
the DT
other JJ
area NN
. .
----------------
You PRP
maybe RB
surprised VBD
. .
----------------
If IN
we PRP
’re VBP
only RB
picking VBG
up RP
unexplored JJ
node RB
what WP
’s VBZ
the DT
point NN
in IN
storing VBG
explored VBN
nodes NNS
, ,
quite RB
interesting JJ
. .
----------------
Obviously RB
they PRP
’re VBP
needed VBN
. .
----------------
Whenever WRB
you PRP
explore VBP
a DT
node NN
, ,
whenever WRB
you PRP
generate VBP
children NNS
for IN
a DT
node NN
what WP
if IN
the DT
child NN
is VBZ
already RB
explored VBN
. .
----------------
We PRP
’ve VB
seen VBN
the DT
earlier JJR
cases NNS
, ,
the DT
repeated VBN
nodes NNS
and CC
the DT
nodes NNS
which WDT
are VBP
already RB
explored VBN
. .
----------------
So CC
if IN
you PRP
look VBP
at IN
that DT
array NN
you PRP
can MD
easily RB
understand VB
the DT
children NNS
that WDT
you PRP
’re VBP
generating VBG
is VBZ
already RB
explored VBN
. .
----------------
So RB
you PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
add VB
them PRP
in IN
the DT
explored JJ
array NN
and CC
that DT
’s VBZ
why WRB
the DT
reason NN
we PRP
’re VBP
keeping VBG
that DT
array NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So CC
this DT
is VBZ
how WRB
we PRP
’re VBP
doing VBG
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So RB
the DT
beginning NN
you PRP
just RB
insert RB
all DT
nodes NNS
in IN
an DT
array NN
and CC
other JJ
unexplored JJ
node NN
in IN
the DT
other JJ
array NN
and CC
find VB
out RP
the DT
best JJS
node NN
from IN
the DT
array NN
. .
----------------
If IN
the DT
array NN
is VBZ
empty JJ
they PRP
report VBP
failure NN
. .
----------------
When WRB
the DT
array NN
becomes VBZ
empty JJ
because IN
there EX
is VBZ
no DT
node NN
to TO
explore VB
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
It PRP
is VBZ
impossible JJ
in IN
some DT
cases NNS
but CC
it PRP
is VBZ
possible JJ
in IN
some DT
cases NNS
as RB
well RB
. .
----------------
So RB
whenever WRB
there EX
is VBZ
no DT
node NN
to TO
explore VB
you PRP
can MD
not RB
go VB
further RB
and CC
there EX
is VBZ
no DT
end NN
, ,
there EX
is VBZ
no DT
this DT
thing NN
road NN
ahead RB
. .
----------------
Now RB
two CD
important JJ
characteristics NNS
of IN
best JJS
first JJ
search NN
. .
----------------
Best RBS
first RB
, ,
remember VB
the DT
word NN
best RBS
first JJ
means VBZ
that IN
we PRP
’re VBP
only RB
exploring VBG
best JJS
nodes NNS
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
So RB
obviously RB
we PRP
need VBP
to TO
have VB
unexplored JJ
nodes NNS
. .
----------------
I PRP
’ve VB
already RB
talked VBN
about IN
the DT
need NN
. .
----------------
The DT
other JJ
one NN
which WDT
is VBZ
also RB
quite RB
interesting JJ
is VBZ
that IN
we PRP
always RB
pick VBP
up RP
the DT
best JJS
node NN
irrespective NN
of IN
the DT
parent NN
value NN
. .
----------------
So RB
unlike IN
hill NN
climbing VBG
it PRP
does VBZ
not RB
get VB
stuck JJ
. .
----------------
It PRP
tries VBZ
all DT
possible JJ
way NN
to TO
explore VB
the DT
search NN
surface NN
and CC
get VB
the DT
solution NN
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
the DT
heuristic JJ
search NN
process NN
. .
----------------
If IN
you PRP
look VBP
at IN
the DT
search NN
process NN
that WDT
is VBZ
described VBN
earlier RBR
you PRP
move VBP
in IN
this DT
direction NN
and CC
this DT
direction NN
and CC
this DT
direction NN
you PRP
may MD
feel VB
that IN
it PRP
’s VBZ
called VBN
jittery JJ
. .
----------------
It PRP
moves VBZ
to IN
and CC
fro VB
and CC
it PRP
’s VBZ
not RB
going VBG
directly RB
to IN
the DT
solution NN
. .
----------------
But CC
that DT
is VBZ
quite RB
acceptable JJ
. .
----------------
Why WRB
? .
----------------
Because IN
if IN
there EX
is VBZ
– :
if IN
you PRP
have VBP
a DT
formula NN
which WDT
can MD
directly RB
lead VB
to IN
a DT
solution NN
then RB
it PRP
’s VBZ
not RB
an DT
AI NNP
problem NN
. .
----------------
There EX
is VBZ
a DT
formula NN
you PRP
just RB
apply VBP
if IN
the DT
heuristic JJ
function NN
gives VBZ
you PRP
exact JJ
measure NN
of IN
how WRB
far RB
the DT
goal NN
node RB
is VBZ
you PRP
do VBP
n’t RB
need VB
to TO
do VB
. .
----------------
There EX
is VBZ
no DT
search NN
. .
----------------
The DT
heuristic JJ
function NN
exactly RB
tells VBZ
you PRP
the DT
value NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
In IN
most JJS
cases NNS
, ,
heuristic JJ
function NN
will MD
not RB
give VB
you PRP
exact JJ
value NN
. .
----------------
It PRP
just RB
gives VBZ
you PRP
an DT
estimate NN
, ,
okay UH
and CC
there EX
are VBP
some DT
mathematical JJ
ways NNS
of IN
judging VBG
how WRB
estimate NN
is VBZ
near JJ
to IN
the DT
correct JJ
value NN
and CC
so RB
and CC
so RB
forth RB
. .
----------------
But CC
eventually RB
what WP
we PRP
get VBP
when WRB
we PRP
use VBP
heuristic JJ
is VBZ
the DT
estimate NN
of IN
how WRB
far RB
we PRP
are VBP
from IN
the DT
goal NN
node NN
. .
----------------
And CC
when WRB
we PRP
only RB
have VBP
an DT
estimate NN
it PRP
is VBZ
likely JJ
that IN
we PRP
try VBP
in IN
one CD
direction NN
, ,
we PRP
may MD
fail VB
, ,
we PRP
have VBP
to TO
try VB
in IN
the DT
other JJ
direction NN
and CC
so RB
and CC
so RB
forth RB
. .
----------------
So CC
it PRP
has VBZ
to TO
be VB
that DT
way NN
. .
----------------
Okay UH
and CC
I PRP
’ve VB
already RB
talked VBN
about IN
the DT
chess NN
playing NN
programs NNS
use VBP
serious JJ
heuristics NNS
and CC
sometimes RB
the DT
chess NN
playing NN
programs NNS
use VBP
heuristics NNS
based VBN
on IN
the DT
opponent NN
. .
----------------
For IN
example NN
, ,
Garry NNP
Kasparov NNP
, ,
the DT
Deep JJ
Blue JJ
machine NN
which WDT
IBM NNP
built VBD
which WDT
has VBZ
beaten VBN
Garry NNP
Kasparov NNP
three CD
, ,
two CD
if IN
you PRP
remember VBP
that DT
was VBD
it PRP
was VBD
there RB
in IN
news NN
for IN
quite PDT
some DT
time NN
. .
----------------
So IN
it PRP
could MD
do VB
it PRP
because IN
the DT
chess NN
playing NN
programs NNS
use VBP
heuristics NNS
based VBN
on IN
the DT
way NN
the DT
Garry NNP
Kasparov NNP
used VBD
to TO
play VB
chess NN
. .
----------------
And CC
you PRP
can MD
see VB
the DT
best JJS
first JJ
search NN
the DT
next JJ
figure NN
in IN
the DT
slide NN
shows VBZ
how WRB
best RBS
first JJ
search NN
works NNS
. .
----------------
You PRP
have VBP
minus RB
three CD
, ,
then RB
minus CC
five CD
, ,
minus CC
two CD
and CC
three CD
are VBP
the DT
children NNS
. .
----------------
Now RB
you PRP
can MD
see VB
that IN
there EX
is VBZ
a DT
node JJ
minus RB
three CD
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
explored VBN
three CD
, ,
which WDT
is VBZ
also RB
explored VBN
now RB
which WDT
is VBZ
being VBG
explored VBN
right RB
now RB
. .
----------------
Minus CC
five CD
, ,
two CD
, ,
minus CC
one CD
and CC
two CD
are VBP
yet RB
to TO
be VB
explored VBN
. .
----------------
So RB
they PRP
are VBP
part NN
of IN
the DT
unexplored JJ
nodes NNS
. .
----------------
Minus CC
three CD
and CC
two CD
now RB
they PRP
’re VBP
explored VBN
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
we PRP
’re VBP
only RB
taking VBG
a DT
small JJ
segment NN
of IN
this DT
thing NN
. .
----------------
You PRP
can MD
see VB
that IN
now RB
two CD
is VBZ
the DT
best JJS
this DT
thing NN
. .
----------------
So RB
out IN
of IN
minus NN
five CD
, ,
two CD
, ,
minus CC
one NN
and CC
minus RB
two CD
, ,
two CD
is VBZ
the DT
best JJS
node NN
. .
----------------
See VB
, ,
we PRP
’re VBP
not RB
doing VBG
exploring VBG
it PRP
like IN
hill NN
climbing NN
, ,
okay UH
. .
----------------
If IN
we PRP
’re VBP
exploring VBG
like IN
hill NN
climbing VBG
we PRP
’ve VB
come VBN
to IN
a DT
dead JJ
end NN
actually RB
because IN
three CD
only RB
two CD
children NNS
minus CC
one NN
and CC
minus RB
two CD
both DT
of IN
them PRP
are VBP
having VBG
less JJR
value NN
so IN
we PRP
’ll MD
not RB
be VB
going VBG
forward RB
. .
----------------
But CC
here RB
in IN
this DT
case NN
, ,
two CD
is VBZ
the DT
best JJS
node NN
, ,
so RB
we PRP
’ll MD
explore VB
two CD
. .
----------------
So CC
if IN
two CD
is VBZ
explored VBN
we PRP
get VBP
minus RB
three CD
, ,
minus CC
two CD
and CC
one CD
. .
----------------
So RB
we PRP
’ll MD
explore VB
one CD
. .
----------------
Okay UH
, ,
this DT
is VBZ
again RB
different JJ
than IN
the DT
hill NN
climbing VBG
because IN
if IN
this DT
where WRB
hill NN
climbing VBG
one PRP
can MD
not RB
be VB
explored VBN
it PRP
has VBZ
lesser JJR
value NN
than IN
two CD
. .
