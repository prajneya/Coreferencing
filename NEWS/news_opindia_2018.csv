Congress released its manifesto [pdf ] for the poll-bound Rajasthan on Thursday, which had soft-Hindutva undertones. Other than the promises of loan waiver to farmers other populist promises like unemployment allowance for educated unemployed, Congress manifesto also promises establishment of go-char (grazing) land development board. It also promises upgradation of the existing gau shala which “might have been ignored by the BJP government”. The manifesto also promises a revival of Sanskrit language by encouraging the same in schools. Rajasthan Congress has also promised ‘Vedic Sanskar’ as well as establishment of education board for the same. Congress has also made quite a few promises to people belonging to minority religions. Among other perks, the madarsas to have more computers and internet connection. Congress’ Rajasthan manifesto with the soft-Hindutva approach is in line with the manifesto the grand old party released in Madhya Pradesh . In its ‘vachan patra’ released for Madhya Pradesh earlier this month, Congress promised setting up of Gaushalas at all village panchayats. It also promises construction of Ram Path and a Narmada Parikrama route. Congress has also promised to promote Sanskrit. Rajasthan, along with Telangana, goes to polls on 7th December.

1,OpIndia Staff,"Sidhu had earlier stoked a controversy when he was spotted hugging Pakistani army chief Shiromani Akali Dal National spokesperson and Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa has condemned  Navjot Singh Sidhu for his conduct in Pakistan and criticised Congress for not taking any action for the same. He called this act a planned conspiracy sketched out by Pakistan. “We have been saying since the beginning, Sidhu is being used by the Pakistan government. I don’t know if he’s in agreement with them or is it unintentional. But yes, there is a well-planned strategy of Pakistan’s ISI to use Sidhu as a tool,” the Akali Dal leader said. Sirsa confirmed that when he went to Pakistan he too was persuaded by them to support Khalistan and Pakistan, but Sirsa had turned down the proposal then and had responded by saying that “I am loyal to my country”. He further  said that Pakistan is scheming something big against India. He said, “This is a strategised case, it should not be viewed in isolation. The way Pakistan stop Indian High Commissions from entering Gurudwaras, Khalistan slogans, and posters are carried in Pakistan.” “There is some kind of hidden agenda by ISI and Bajwa. It is a collective attack on India using a different angle,” he added. Speaking of Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s decision to reject the invitation to Pakistan he said, “Captain Amarinder took a stand but what’s the point if there is no action. Just saying on a TV channel is a different thing and doing something is a different thing. A member from his Cabinet is going to Pakistan, praising the Army chief Bajwa who is responsible for killing innocent people of our country. But Sidhu is not condemning his actions, and now he’s joining hands with Gopal Singh Chawla and denying it now.” Punjab Chief Minister, Amarinder Singh had earlier  turned down Pakistan’s invitation saying that due to continued terrorist attacks in Punjab, killings of Indian soldiers by armed forces of Pakistan, he will not be attending the event. He said, “not a day passes when Indian soldiers are not killed or wounded on the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir,” adding that “rather than moving towards normalcy these incidents are escalating.” He had also accused ISI of starting its “nefarious activities within Punjab.” Congress Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had keenly accepted the invitation extended towards him by Pakistan Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Though recently, Army Chief Bipin Rawat had stated  that external forces are attempting to revive the Khalistani insurgency in Punjab and the US government had recently declared  Babbar Khalsa, the Sikh terror group as a threat to American interests, Siddhu, during his visit was seen posing  with Kalistani terrorist Gopal Chawla. He was also seen smiling when Pakistan Prime minister, Imran Khan invited  Sidhu to contest elections in Pakistan, saying that he would surely win if he did. On this, Sirsa added that Sidhu hurt Indian sentiments and proved where his loyalties stand, by not voicing his disapproval, “When Imran Khan asked Sidhu to stand for elections from Pakistan, in no way did he say that he’s a proud India and even though he’s friends with them his loyalties are with his country. And he’s smiling there.” Sidhu had earlier stoked a controversy  when he was spotted hugging Pakistani army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa during his Islamabad visit to attend the oath taking ceremony of his cricket-ground rival Imran Khan. What is shocking here is that the Congress party, who otherwise leaves no opportunity to take a jibe at others has been tongue-tied during this entire episode. In fact, on several occasions, members of the Congress have been seen defending Sidhu for his ill-advised actions. Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa on Wednesday defended  Sidhu’s visit to Pakistan for the groundbreaking ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor, saying that Sidhu visited Pakistan in his personal capacity and the onus of what he says there lies on him alone.",2018-11-30,"Congress,imran khan,Kartarpur,Khalistan,Khalistan sikhs,khalistani terrorists,navjot singh sidhu,Pakistan,pakistan sponsored terrorism,pro-khalistani","Manjinder Sirsa of Akali Dal says Pakistan’s ISI is using Sidhu as a tool, blames Congress for inaction",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/manjinder-sirsa-of-akali-dal-says-pakistans-isi-is-using-sidhu-as-a-tool-blames-congress-for-inaction/
2,Rahul Raj,"Most of the Biharis would have their share of stories under Lalu in which their relatives were looted, their friends were kidnapped or their knowns were murdered. It was only after Nitish became the CM that Biharis stopped hiding their state identity. On one lazy evening of June 2006, Subhas Yadav, the brother-in-law of the then Railway Minister Lalu Prasad was boarding Rajdhani Express from Patna Junction. He found it inconvenient to cross an overbridge to board the train, so he ordered train officials to change the platform of the train, for which hundreds of passengers were waiting at specified platforms. Subhash Yadav got it done. The very next day, his other brother-in-law got Sampoorna Kranti to change the platform. A year later, Subhash Yadav created a ruckus at Patna Junction by getting Rajdhani Express detained for 20 minutes because he couldn’t get a ticket for the train. The train only moved when Subhash Yadav was provided accommodation in the AC first class of train. This was the kind of lawlessness which Lalu’s kin was exercising when Lalu Yadav was not in power. Imagine what would be the case before that. In 1973-74, young Lalu entered active politics by becoming one of the key figures in the JP-led student movement. For the next 15 years, he saw many ups and downs in his career, and then came 1990! 1990 brought an unprecedented change in his career graph. First, political equations and political ego clashes favoured Lalu to become the CM of Bihar, and then, in the same year, Lalu did something which gave him prominence at the national level. Lalu arrested L.K.Advani during Rath Yatra and blamed him of spreading communal tensions. Thus gave him a huge visibility and made him the secular star of the nation. What happened to Bihar after this is something which changed the state forever. Let’s start with the good part first. Lalu played a very crucial role in raising the stature of lower castes in Bihar. Casteism was so dominant in Bihar that from the employment of a peon to the selection of BPSC top officials, lower caste had to face discrimination. Even in top colleges like PMCH, Engineering College Patna or Engineering College Muzaffarpur, students were divided into caste brackets or xylem/phloem on the very first day. The extreme discrimination also led to the disappearance of caste-based surnames and birth of surnames like Raj, Prakash, Roushan, Kumar, Ranjan, Rani, etc. — a phenomenon which amuses Indian belonging to different states. He did empower lower castes people and gave them entry into the mainstream. This gave Lalu such a strong vote bank that even now BJP, JDU, LJP, Congress couldn’t breach. Now comes the haunting part. While Lalu did work towards the upliftment of the lower castes, this resulted also in a sort of reserve casteism where the upper caste Bhumihars and Rajputs started fearing from Lalu. In fact, from the lower castes, it was now the upper castes who started changing their surnames to hide their identity. Under Lalu, every form of crime was institutionalized. “Rangdaari tax” became an official term in Bihar. Extortion, kidnapping, murders, booth capturing became so common that Biharis changed their lifestyles to cope with it. Even in the capital city, people stopped roaming after 8 in the night. While other stated were constructing roads, hospitals, schools, colleges, institutes, Bihar was feeding crores of fodder to animals. Many companies fled away from Bihar and never returned. The dilapidated Gandhi Setu built between Patna and Hajipur soon became the real imagery of Bihar. People were paying tax for a shaky bridge which was fighting to survive and the tax money never reached it. This was not the worst thing under Lalu. The more unfortunate part was that Lalu cracked public jokes on the plight of the state and the most unfortunate part was that people laughed at those jokes. When India was gearing up for computer revolution, Lalu was asking, “yeh IT YT kya hai, kya computer doodh deta hai?” Just a sweet coincidence that while many Biharis are working in IT sectors of Bangalore, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Mysore or Chennai, Bihar doesn’t have any large IT firm. When more than 5 lakh people were affected by the flood levels in the Ganga, Lalu Prasad was telling people that “it’s a fortunate and welcome sight to find the Ganga at one’s doorsteps”. In other depressing flood situation, Lalu entertained the media by enlightening them that flood is good for the poor as they can have fish in their meal now. When Lalu was paralyzing railways by fudging data, his followers were not worried about their future, but they were happy that Lalu is able to fool the international media. It is a big irony that Lalu became a secular hero by making a mockery of secularism. Lalu publicly boasted his famous M-Y (Muslim Yadav) theory meant to exclusively woo Muslims and Yadavs. Bihar was becoming a priority destination of ISI infiltrators, but instead of controlling it, Lalu promoted Bahubalis like Shahabuddin. A brief reading about Shahabuddin will send a chill down your spine. If that was not enough, Lalu used of a look-alike of Osama Bin Laden in the 2005 Bihar election to woo Muslims. Most of the Biharis would have their share of stories under Lalu in which their relatives were looted, their friends were kidnapped or their knowns were murdered. It was only after Nitish became the CM that Biharis stopped hiding their state identity.",2018-11-30,"Appeasement politics,Bihar,Lalu Prasad Yadav,Lutyens,Pseudo-secularism",I don’t care whether politicians fear the rise of Lalu or not.

5,Jinit Jain,"It is becoming increasingly difficult for Congress and Rahul Gandhi to maintain that Sidhu's visit to Pakistan and his shenanigans while in Pakistan did not have the sanction of the highest leadership of Congress including Rahul Gandhi.  Amidst under severe fire from all quarters, Congress minister Sidhu appeared to brazen it out his decision of visiting Pakistan. We had earlier reported  how Sidhu was heard talking about the special plane that was arranged by Rahul Gandhi for him, days before he left for Pakistan. Now, speaking to ANI, Sidhu has reiterated that he was granted the nod of approval to visit Pakistan from the Congress central leadership. Sidhu said this in response to questions about Punjab Chief Minister saying that Sidhu should have refrained from going to Pakistan. However, this comes in sharp contrast to the Congress party’s claim that Siddhu went to attend Kartarpur Corridor’s groundbreaking ceremony on the basis of his personal friendship with Pak PM Imran Khan. Congress had earlier claimed  that Sidhu had gone to Pakistan in his ‘personal capacity’. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh had already expressed his displeasure on Siddhu’s visit to the ceremony. CM Amarinder Singh said, “ I asked him to reconsider his decision to visit Pakistan but yet he went.” Blaming Pakistan for sponsoring terrorism in India, CM Singh said , “I will not allow terrorism to grow in Punjab. For the first time, there were some terrorists from Kashmir trying to establish logistics base in Punjab. Pakistan is using these terrorists to execute their nefarious plans, but we won’t permit it.” CM Amarinder Singh rejected the invite citing continuous occurrence of terror activities sponsored by Pakistan in India. Facing flak for being snapped  with a known Khalistani terrorist Gopal Singh Chawla, Siddhu appeared in a defensive mode to justify his visit. He said, “ thousands of photos were clicked in Pakistan, I don’t know who is a Khalistani terrorist and who is not.” On one hand, Congress ministers claim that Sidhu went in the Kartarpur corridor ceremony in his personal capacity. On the other hand, Sidhu was heard claiming  that Rahul Gandhi had sent him a personal plane to aid his visit to Pakistan. Amid such contrasting claims, it’s hard to interpret Congress’ true stance and it is becoming increasingly difficult for Congress and Rahul Gandhi to maintain that Sidhu’s visit to Pakistan and his shenanigans while in Pakistan did not have the sanction of the highest leadership of Congress including Rahul Gandhi.",2018-11-30,"Captain Amarinder Singh,Congress lies,Kartarpur,navjot singh sidhu,Rahul Gandhi lies",Congress cannot distance itself from Sidhu’s shenanigans after he said Rahul Gandhi wanted him to visit Pakistan,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/congress-navjot-singh-sidhu-pakistan-kartarpur-rahul-gandhi-wanted-him-to-go/
6,OpIndia Staff,"TRS has promised that if they win, the party will ensure a 12% quota for Muslims in the state. The incumbent CM of Telangana K Chandrasekhar Rao was seen losing his cool again yesterday when he spoke rudely to a man who had asked him a question on reservation quota for minorities. As per reports , the caretaker CM was addressing a public meeting in Kagazangar in Komaram Bheem Asifabad. During his interaction with the people, a man stood up to ask him a question about the proposed 12% reservation to minorities. KCR was seen replying to the man,”Baat karte baitho, baitho khamosh baitho” (I am speaking, sit silently). He showed irritation when the man apparently did not sit down and went on to say, ” Cheptha kadha ra bhai, thondara endhuku padthunavu” (i am going to speak, why are you in such a hurry). He further added, “baitho khamosh baitho. Bolraha hun na baitho, kya tumhare baap ko bolun kya baatein? (sit silently, I am telling you to sit, shall I tell your father?) Some volunteers reportedly rushed towards the man asking questions but KCR stopped them. KCR’s party TRS has long been promising 12% quota for Muslims in the state. He had recently announced  in poll rallies that his party will give 12% reservation to Muslims and it is the NDA government at the centre which is obstructing the proposal. BJP President Amit Shah had slammed KCR for his Muslim quota claim and stated that religion-based reservations are unconstitutional . He had added that as the SC had made it clear that there is a 50% ceiling on total reservations, KCR should make it clear that among the SC, ST and OBCs, from whose reservation cap his TRS government is going to carve out a quota for Muslims. He had added that the BJP will never allow a religion based quota in the country.

7,Nirwa Mehta,"Yet again the politicians have used a cause to play politics and lay their pitch for the upcoming general elections As the 2019 general election draws closer, the Opposition parties have scrambled together to put up a united front to beat the BJP, by hook or by crook. This includes hijacking the farmers’ cause and using it as a platform to further their agenda, all the while, pretending to care for their plight. We had already reported that the farmers’ march  to the national capital demanding a minimum support price for their crops and freedom from debt was led by the front with affiliation with various communist and leftist parties. The march, organised by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a rather spontaneous front which has  Jai Kisan Andolan (JKA) and former AAP politician Yogendra Yadav’s Swaraj Abhiyan as its members. All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), another communist  frontal organization affiliated to attached to communist political parties, All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha (AIKMS), associated  with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), All India Kisan Mahasabha (AIKM), All India Khet Mazdoor Kisan Sabha (AIKMKS), AIKS (Canning Street) which are Left  organizations – all constitute the AIKSCC. So needless to say that the farmers’ march appeared as politically motivated as the ‘Kisan Long March ‘ held earlier this year in March. Considering the entire march was spearheaded by Communists and supported by Rahul Gandhi, who in Karnataka, in alliance with Kumaraswamy has failed to keep their promise to the farmers’, for them to pretend to care for the farmers’ and gift wrapping this political rally as a spontaneous farmers’ rally is disingenuous, to say the least. Today, when the march, organised by communists leaders reached Jantar Mantar in Delhi, politicians across party lines got together and held hands on stage to show their strength. Congress President Rahul Gandhi, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury and Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal joined hands and tried to score their political points. Rahul Gandhi repeated  his usual lie  that loan of industrialists are waived off (while in reality they are written off, there is a difference ) and hence the farmers’ loans should also be waived off. Rahul was joined on stage by CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury  and AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal , both of whom pitched for the upcoming 2019 elections. Farooq Abdullah, too, used the platform to make a nationalist pitch by asking the crowd to chant ‘Jai Hind’. There certainly must have been farmers in that rally, but the organisation and spearheading of it by politicians desperate to hold on to, or regain power was a well-crafted rhetoric. The most tragic part of the entire affair was two-fold. One, the media refused to acknowledge that this was a Communist organised political rally and second, the farmers cause got lost in political lies and rhetoric. The politics behind the ‘solidarity with farmers’ was not lost on twitterati, who were quick to call out the facade. Some even pointed out the high profile ‘farmers’ who were missing from the frame. And some rightly pointed out the irony. This just goes out to show that the said march was nothing bit a political gimmick. That while there might be real farmers in the march, it was more of a tool for the opposition parties to show their strength against Modi. With general elections just a few months away the political landscape is all set to get murkier. We had earlier seen how the same set of politicians  had come together and made merry while ‘protesting’ against the Bihar rape cases. In August this year, fodder scam convict  Lalu Yadav’s MLA son Tejashwi Yadav had called for a protest against the rapes for ‘dignity of Bharat Mata’s daughters’ at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar. Sharing a stage there, AAP Supremo Arvind Kejriwal was caught smiling and sharing a joke with Tejashwi as well as student leaders. This just goes out to show that the ‘Game of Throne’ has just begun.

8,Sambit Nayak,"Systematic targeting and muzzling of media by state, which is not to be conflated with a political party, does not augur very well in a democracy. May better sense prevail soon. The bitter spat and ugly fallout of longtime BJD MP Baijayant Panda with his party became a public spectacle earlier this year. Simmering tensions between Baijayant and Naveen Patnaik were no secret earlier as well. Naveen is not known to be very benevolent to his detractors. However, recent events suggest that the fallout now has ramifications in how the government formulates its public policy vis-a-vis the press, which is rather tragic and dangerous. Odisha’s largest news media channel OTV is owned by Baijayant Panda’s family. On 20th November, OTV ran a story showing how honourable speaker Pradip Amat was acting on behest of Assembly secretary Amiya Kumar Sarangi after the latter whispered in his ear to adjourn the house. Immediately after this, the speaker is seen to be adjourning the house. To translate it for our non-Odia readers, the assembly secretary is first seen talking to parliamentary affairs minister Shri Bikram Keshari Arukh. Later, he is whispering “ Right after the story was reported, a privilege motion was moved against OTV by Congress MLA Taraprasad Bahinipati which was accepted by the speaker. It is interesting to note here that, Prameya News 7, 2nd in the BARC rating among Odia news channels, ran the same story but no such notice was issued against them. This privilege notice was only for OTV. A quick note on privilege motion. Members of the house enjoy certain privileges to discharge their duty effectively. When any of these rights or immunities are disregarded, it amounts to a breach of privilege and a notice is moved in form of a motion. However, in the last 2 occasions in the case of Abhijit Iyer  and OTV, the state assembly seems to move such motion, which is to be used rather judiciously, at its whims. Abhijit passed in some very unsavoury remarks against the Chief Minister and the legislators as well. Sure, it may amount defamation if one may think so and it remains for the courts to decide, it surely doesn’t breach the privilege of members, neither it restricts them to effectively discharge their duties. OTV’s broadcast doesn’t even amount to any kind of defamatory Odisha is hosting the ongoing Hockey world cup, 2018. The capital is all decked up for this added to the frenzied media and enthusiastic and Hockey loving denizens. There is a huge facelift given to public spaces and facade of Bhubaneswar and state government has done a tremendous job readying the city in time to host the grand event. With respect to this, the secretary of Department of Sports and Youth Services (DSY), Mr Vishal Dev called a few press members to brief them about how the preparations for the world cup is going on. DSY maintains that it was not a press briefing but the secretary only called a selected few press members while OTV “barged in”. Whatever the case may be, Vishal Dev refused to speak while OTV boom was on his table. He asked the OTV reporter to get out of his room as it’s not a “public park” that anyone can come visiting without an invitation. He started the briefing only after OTV representative left the scene. Vishal Dev’s grouse was that OTV broadcasted some adverse report regarding online ticket sales and insinuated that government officers didn’t handle it properly. Government targeting OTV didn’t end there. Just before the opening ceremony, the press accreditation of OTV’s sports bureau chief was cancelled. When cornered, the government clarified that it’s Hockey India’s prerogative on which press to be allowed and who is not. The state government has no role to play. It’s amusing that Hockey India will cancel press accreditation of the sports bureau chief of the leading Odia Channel, which has more than double the viewership  than its nearest competitor while hosting the most important event of Hockey in the state of Odisha. This animosity with OTV isn’t new. Early in March this year, BJD boycotted OTV  and stopped sending it’s representative or spokespersons to OTV alleging that it has lost its neutrality. This is fair though. Boycotting a channel or a commercial establishment is a democratic right and any party or individual is well within his own entitlement to boycott anything they deem fit. However, systematic targeting and muzzling of media by state, which is not to be conflated with a political party, does not augur very well in a democracy.

9,OpIndia Staff,"Satyendra Jain will be prosecuted in disproportionate asset and money laundering cases The Ministry of Home Affairs has sanctioned  prosecution of Delhi minister Satyendra Jain in a disproportionate asset and money laundering case. In August last year, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a case against the AAP leader accusing him of acquiring assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. It is alleged that Jain floated several shell companies in Delhi which did not have any real business. Some of these companies are  M/s Akichan Developers Private Limited, M/s Indo Metal Impex Private Limited, M/s Paryas Infosolutions Private Limited and M/s Manglayatan Projects Private Limited, which were launched between 2009 and 2011. Jain had laundered black money of ₹16.39 crore from hawala operators through 54 shell companies, according to the case. Jain is alleged to have laundered unaccounted cash through the hawala operators and received cheques of an equal amount from them. He also purchased land in the name companies owned by him including black money. It is alleged that he purchased lands near unauthorised colonies in Delhi. Jain was also prosecuted  under Prohibition of Benami Property Transaction Act, 1988 (PBPT Act), and after the investigation was over and it was established that Satyendra Jain was the owner of the shell companies, the shares of the companies and the land owned by them was attached. After that, Jain had declared an income of ₹16.39 crore under the Income Declaration Scheme and had paid the tax on it. While investigating the source of this black money, hawala operations and use of cash for land purchase were detected, and cases were registered by CBI accordingly. Reacting to this development, Satyendra Jain tried to suggest that he was being prosecuted for regularising unauthorised colonies, and not for money laundering allegations.

11,Editorial Desk,"Chandorkar also believes that Fadnavis hasn't received the credit he deserves. He says that if BJP goes on to win perform well in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a lot of the credit should go to Fadnavis.  Editor of OpIndia.com, Nupur Sharma, recently interviewed Ashish Chandorkar, author of the newly released book, ‘The Fadnavis Years’. The book, ‘The Fadnavis Years’, focuses on Devendra Fadnavis’ rise to power and his tenure thus far as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Chandorkar says that he was motivated by the urge to describe things as they are happening currently. He says, “We are pretty bad at documenting contemporary history. People who are even politically aware, their knowledge of what has happened in recent years, what drives politics in each state, the idea of politics for them is very abstract.” He goes on to say that a lot of things has changed in recent years and that there was a need for a contemporary perspective. It is that sentiment that emerged in the form of his book, ‘The Fadnavis Years’. The author also elaborates on the increasing differences between the Shiv Sena and the BJP. Bal Thackeray’s death was a critical moment in the relationship between the two parties as until then, his towering leadership bound both parties together. From Sena’s perspective, he says, they have been traditionally strong in certain pockets of the state. Combined with the personal ambitions of the leadership of the party to grow their base and the credible threat mounted by the BJP to dislodge it from the stature of the senior partner in the alliance, they ended up taking some decisions which have resulted in a fallout. The 2014 Assembly elections in the state saw 4 parties contesting for power individually. Chandorkar asserts that the reason for this was that every party wanted to figure out where they stand individually with the Modi factor kicking in. Moreover, the BJP was also more confident about their chances than ever after the Lok Sabha elections. He says, “The BJP’s perspective changed, it was they who were in the lead and they were no longer the smaller party. Because of the Lok Sabha success, the BJP thought why should it compromise when the seat-sharing talks were going on.” He also says that multiple rounds of talks were held where the BJP wanted to continue with the alliance but with the added clause of having the upper hand. Fadnavis was chosen as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on the basis a combination of factors. Contrary to popular claims, Chandorkar insists that Fadnavis was not ‘airdropped’ into the national scene after the election. He documents that Fadnavis rose to the position he is in today by rising meticulously through the ranks. Fadnavis’ image as a clean politician worked in his favour, claims Chandorkar. “He is someone people could relate to.” The second factor that works in his favour is his focus on infrastructure and the ‘no-nonsense’ manner in which he has gone about his work. Agricultural marketing is one of the areas where Fadnavis has significantly improved things. His policy reforms in the agricultural sector have improved things for the better significantly. The infrastructure projects initiated by Fadnavis is another great achievement of his, claims Chandorkar. The metro projects and highway projects he has initiated have made an immediate impact. His communication strategy has also helped him convey his message significantly. Our Editor also asked Chandorkar about Fadnavis’ perceived lack of support for ‘core’ Hindu issues. He says that he made a conscious decision to not focus too much attention on ‘core’ as he was focused on Fadnavis’ work on policies. According to him, ‘core’ voter is someone who votes unconditionally. He says that he does not dismiss the ‘core’ issues but these are not issues that people vote on. “If these issues had great political relevance, BJP would have already lost several elections.” “If people were actually voting on what people on Twitter call ‘core’ issues, then BJP would have already been nonexistent in the state. What has happened is exactly the opposite,” Chandorkar says. Chandorkar also believes that Fadnavis hasn’t received the credit he deserves. He says that if BJP goes on to perform well in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a lot of the credit should go to Fadnavis. The book ‘The Fadnavis Years’ focuses greatly on Fadnavis’ policy reforms and how he has strengthened BJP’s position in the state and has navigated through a highly complicated political scene to only emerge stronger than before.

12,Ullas,"At best, Imran Khan is trying to get good PR going from a global perspective. Especially, in light of PM Modi's global campaign for India, Imran has realized that he needs to up his game to stand a chance. In light of stinging attacks by Trump, especially in the recent past, Pakistan already is on the back foot. Religions have been instruments to heal differences and also to increase tensions in many instances. So, when Modi government gave approval for the Kartarpur corridor, many felt it was a step forward by the Indian government. This especially when terror activities continue unabated in the Kashmir region. Many who support the government welcomed the move. However, when Pakistan planned to have its own groundbreaking ceremony for the corridor and the Modi government decided to send representatives for the event, the outrage started. The outrage was justified too. Instead of the understanding the reasons for this difference of opinion by the ardent Modi supporters, media, as usual, went about giving them names and mocking them. Let’s get to the facts. It was not as if Congress leader Navjot Singh Siddhu came up with this brilliant idea of opening the Kartarpur corridor for the Sikh pilgrims from India during the oath-taking ceremony of Imran Khan. This has been a long pending demand by successive Indian governments. This was never heeded to by the Pakistani government and its controllers. In fact, India had long back taken the first step in granting a visa to Pakistani pilgrims to visit Ajmer Sharif. There was no policy difference on this matter between different political parties at all (political posturing is a different matter). In fact, when he was still the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Prime Minister Modi himself had supported  extending visas to Pakistani citizens who visit India to watch cricket matches to get the opportunity to visit Ajmer Sharif. Cut to today. The headlines in various newspapers is nauseating. In fact, if you try to find the difference between Indian and Pakistani newspapers, we would be shocked to see the similarity in narratives.   Headlines are not meant just to quote statements by various leaders. They also serve as a guide to the reader about the general direction of the story. None of the above headlines is critical of Imran Khan for not mentioning anything about “terror” in Kashmir. I would guess that a section of the Indian population would have agreed with him, or even supported him if he had at least talked about his helplessness in addressing the terror activities. The paeans being sung by the mainstream media  that Imran Khan has taken a historic step is highly misplaced. This was at best a good reciprocatory step. If it is historic or not will be determined, after a period of five years at least – when all Sikh pilgrims return to India alive after their pilgrimage visiting Kartarpur. When a visiting cricket team is not spared  of attacks, it would be prudent to wait and see if pilgrims are spared. Never discount the fact that ‘Taliban Khan’ is still openly hobnobbing with the Chinese against India. Have mainstream Indian journalists forgotten Imran Khan’s tweet  to Modi mocking him? How can any foreign policy expert expect India to reciprocate when he calls the Prime Minister a “small man”? In fact, it is not even about the fact that it is Modi who is the Prime Minister right now. Any head of India being mocked in this manner must not be tolerated. However, on second thoughts, this may be precisely the reason the Lutyens based Indian journalists  are enamoured by Imran as the man to stop Modi in his tracks. Imran had effectively closed all doors for resolutions after this sham tweet. The opening of the Kartarpur corridor was more of a political stunt to attract Nawaz Sharif’s base in Pakistan – who had elected Sharif the previous time on his call to resolve issues with India. Of course, along with military support, he has to get a chunk of votes to stay in power. At best, Imran Khan is trying to get good PR going from a global perspective. Especially, in light of PM Modi’s global campaign for India, Imran Khan has realized that he needs to up his game to stand a chance. In light of stinging attacks  by Trump, especially in the recent past , Pakistan already is on the back foot. After going with begging bowl to China for funds and returning  empty-handed, Imran Khan has realized that he needs to broaden support globally to attract more financial support. With this being the financial reality, Imran dare not any misadventure with India – even a small one. It is quite natural for the Pakistani media to hide this. What is really unfortunate is that Indian media playing chorus to the same tune.",2018-11-29,"imran khan,India,Kartarpur,Lutyens media,mainstream media,media bias,Modi,Narendra Modi,Pakistan","Dear Indian journalists, don’t go gaga over Kartarpur corridor, for Pakistan and Imran Khan it is a matter of survival",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/dear-indian-journalists-dont-go-gaga-over-kartarpur-corridor-for-pakistan-and-imran-khan-it-is-a-matter-of-survival/
13,OpIndia Staff,"The Devendra Fadnavis government had on 18 November approved the SBCC panel's recommendation on Maratha reservation. The Maharashtra Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed  a Bill proposing 16 per cent reservation for Marathas under socially and educationally backward category. The bill has now gone to the Upper House. The Bill provides  for reservation of seats for admission in educational institutions and posts in public services to the Marathas who have been declared as socially and educationally backward and under-represented. The Fadnavis government had on November 18 approved  the SBCC panel’s recommendation for a 16% quota for Marathas. The SBCC panel had suggested  that looking at exceptional circumstances and extraordinary situations generated on declaring Marathas as socially and educationally backwards and their consequential entitlement to reservation benefits, the government may take appropriate decision within constitutional provision to address the emerging scenario in the state. The panel report said that Marathas have inadequate representation in services under the state and they are entitled to reservation benefits and advantages enshrined in the Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution. Chief Minister Fadnavis had earlier hinted at the government’s decision to table the Maratha reservation bill in the state assembly. “I request all of you to prepare to celebrate on December 1,” he said while addressing a gathering in Ahmednagar.

14,OpIndia Staff,"In its latest gimmick, the Congress has been seen using the slain's daughter to further their agenda, which thrives on dividing people on the basis of caste, against the BJP. As the Rajasthan’s state assembly election  campaign reaches its last leg with all the political parties fighting it out till their last breath, the Congress, who has a penchant to indulge in caste-based politics , is trying to use the death of Anandpal Singh, the most wanted gangster, who was celebrated among Rajputs and considered their ‘messiah’ (redeemer). Reports have emerged  that the mother of the slain gangster, Nirmala Kanwar is likely to contest either as a Congress candidate or an independent candidate supported by the Congress in the Rajasthan Assembly elections. In its latest gimmick , the Congress has also been seen using the slain’s daughter to further their agenda, which thrives on dividing people on the basis of caste, against the BJP. The Congress strategises to use Yogita Singh, slain Anandpal Singh’s daughter as a sympathy card to woo Rajput voters. Yogita Singh, while addressing a program under the chairmanship of District President Keshar Singh, Ravana Rajput, in Sujangarh Ravana Rajput Sabha building on Sunday, blamed the BJP government for the death of her father. This program was attended by various Congress leaders, including Congress nominee Bhawarlal Meghwal. In many such gatherings addressed by the slain gangster’s family, especially his daughter, Congress supporters have raised slogans in gangster’s favour in presence of party candidates. The gatherings see appeal made to the Rajput society to take ‘revenge’ from the BJP government by voting in favour of Congress. This caste-based campaigning, which the Congress is maliciously using to gain popularity in BJPs’ predominant domain, Rajasthan, was earlier also used to belittle the incumbent government. Congress carrying on their age old tradition of playing caste-based politics, instead of condemning the protest, in which at least one person was killed and 32 people, including 20 policemen, were injured, latched on to this opportunity to belittle Congress’ biggest threat, the BJP. Eluding the police for almost two years, the dreaded Rajasthan gangster, Anandpal Singh (47), wanted in 37 cases including murder, finally met his end in a police encounter  on June 24, 2017. Anandpal Singh was arrested in 2012 for murder from a farmhouse in Jaipur. In 2015, he dramatically escaped from police custody on his way back from court to a prison in Ajmer. Belonging to Rajasthan’s Ravana Rajput community, Singh came from a small village in Saawad in Ladon tehsil of Nagaur district in Rajasthan. One of the most dreaded gangsters was, however, hailed by the people of his community for having created employment opportunities for them. His killing had stirred a controversy  with people of the Rajput community protesting, alleging, that the gangster wanted to surrender but was shot dead by the police in cold blood. The protestors and his family had then demanded  a CBI probe in the case. Congress’ controversial leader Digvijaya Singh had jumped  into the controversy surrounding the death of Anandpal Singh, saying Rajasthan’s Rajput ministers should resign if Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje does not order CBI probe into the encounter of the gangster. In fact, it has been recently reported  that the SOG involved in Anandpal Singh’s encounter is still getting death threats from the gangster’s brothers and close aides. The state government has decided to beef up the security of these police personnel in lieu of the continuous threats being received by them. This is, however, not the first time Congress has taken recourse  to caste-based politics. During the buildup to the Gujarat elections, the Congress party had surprised  many by openly declaring its intention to woo Hindus, with Rahul Gandhi going on a literal “temple run” during the state’s campaign. The party further ‘saffronised’ Rahul as a Janeu-dhari Shiv Bhakt’ when rumours spread  about his name being registered in the non-Hindu register of the Somnath temple. We have seen Congress supporting  Bhim Army in Uttar Pradesh. They fanned the Bhima-Koregaon violence hailing the protests and blaming BJP for ignoring Dalits. While playing these caste-based politics the party has methodically used  the Rohit Vemula suicide case, extended support to people like Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani in their attempt to appease the Dalits. They have also tried to encash the ‘Lingayat ‘ card prior to the Karnataka elections. In fact, the deep-rooted, horrendous, casteist bias of the Congress Party was boldly out in the open when their loyalist Mani Shankar Aiyer had audaciously passed a casteist remark  calling PM Modi a ‘neech’ aadmi. The Congress subsequently revoking Mani Shankar’s suspension, which had come in lieu of his ‘neech’ comment furthered  the parties penchant. Sonia Gandhi, the party supremo, reportedly too had used  the same word to describe Modi in 2014, at a rally in Kushinagar (UP). Recently, the Congress’ effort to come across as a pro-Hindutva party fell flat when Congress veterans were seen taking a u-turn trying to woo  the minority community. While the Congress desperately tries to prove itself to be a secular party, comments coming from party veterans like Ghulam Nabi Azad referring to Modi as a “Gangu Teli” (Modi comes from the Teli caste) itself proves the deep-seated casteist mindset of the party. Congress’ desperate attempt to ride two horses at the same time laid exposed several times. What is appalling is that one of the oldest party, rather than addressing issues of development has been resorting to such shallow tactics. As the 2019 general elections draw close, the once grand party of India’s politics seems to be fighting a desperate battle.",2018-11-29,"Anti-Hindu Congress,BJP,Caste Divide,caste politics,Casteism,Congress,Congress lies,Digvijay Singh,Rajasthan Assembly Election,vasundhara raje",Congress using slain gangster’s family to appeal for Rajput votes in Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/congress-using-slain-gangsters-family-to-appeal-for-rajput-votes-in-rajasthan/

BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Bagga, who was invited to a debate last night to discuss the Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, refused to criticise Sidhu in front of Pakistani guest saying that it is our internal matter and he would not be critical of Sidhu in front of Pakistani guest. In the above video, during the debate, Bagga could be heard saying he would not like to discuss grievances he has with Sidhu in front of the Pakistani guest. He added that this is an internal matter of our country and that he would speak up and criticise Sidhu, but not in front of a Pakistani guest. Speaking to OpIndia, Bagga said that he refuses to indulge Pakistan because of the duality it shows on issue of terrorism. “On one side they are saying if India takes one step forward, we will take two steps for peace, on the other side Pakistan hosts the Khalistan Referendum 2020. And this is just one example, Pakistan has been sponsoring terrorism while talking of making peace effort,” said Bagga. Khalistan Referendum 2020 is a movement by Sikh separatist groups to influence Sikhs to ‘liberate Punjab from India’s occupation’ through a referendum. A convention is planned  in Pakistan in November 2019 to influence Sikhs who visit Kartarpur Sahib Gurudwara who visit the shrine to commemorate Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary.

Harsimrat Kaur had visited Pakistan to attend the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Pakistan side of the Kartarpur Corridor, where Sidhu was also invited. Harsimrat Badal’s dig at Congress leader Sidhu comes after Imran Khan showered  praises on him saying that Sidhu will win even if he contests an election in Pakistan. Imran Khan had stood in support  of Navjot Singh Sidhu after he was severely criticised in India for visiting Pakistan to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Imran Khan, where he had hugged  Pakistan Army General Bajwa. “He (Imran Khan) offered him (Navjot Singh Sidhu) to fight elections from Pakistan.

Ahead of Telangana assembly polls, the BJP on Wednesday alleged  that names of illegal Rohingya Muslims  have been included  in the voters’ list of 15 constituencies of Hyderabad. The party sought a probe by the Election Commission (EC) on this joint conspiracy of the Congress, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and the ruling party the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). BJP further accused  the parties of deleting names from Telangana voters’ list on grounds of their community. A delegation comprising Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, party general secretary Arun Singh and BJP’s national media head Anil Baluni met top EC officials to submit their memorandum in this regard. After the meeting, Naqvi told  reporters that though the Union Home Ministry had given clear instructions  that Rohingya Muslims are not Indian citizens, they have been registered as voters in Telangana. “The registration of Rohingya Muslims as voters is a clear violation of laws of the land. The Election Commission may institute a special investigation team to probe the matter,” the BJP said in its memorandum to the Commission. The BJP alleging that there has been an exceptional increase in the number of voters as names of several fake voters and Rohingyas’ have illegally been included in the list,  demanded  that electoral rolls of 15 assembly constituencies in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation be rectified before the assembly election. Speaking to the media, Naqvi said, “Genuine voters from a particular community and supporting a specific party have been deleted under a planned conspiracy. Names of several fake voters have been included in the list. Around 700-800 voters have the same address. Names of Rohingyas have also been included in the list. They should not be allowed to cast votes. We demanded the Election Commission to look into the loopholes before the election and take action against officers involved.” On November 28, it has come to light, that while names of Rohingyas have been deleted from Ranga Reddy and Medak districts, 71 out of 189 names still exist in the electoral rolls of the Hyderabad district. All these illegal voters are registered  under the Chandrayangutta constituency, where Akbaruddin Owaisi from the AIMIM party has been an MLA since 1999. This pinpoints a major lapse by the Telangana Election Commission.

18,Abhishek Banerjee,"Remember that the one lakh vocal Communists on the streets of Delhi today are here to silence the democratic mandate of 17 crore people who voted for BJP and PM Modi in the last election. Today in Delhi, Communist organizations  have put together a massive rally with over one lakh people. The media are calling this a “farmers rally” instead of a Communist rally as it should rightly be called. Let’s dissect this. In the last General Election, Communist Parties together polled only around 4% of the vote. Although the Communist Parties started out in 1952 as the largest opposition bloc, their electoral fortunes kept declining. After a few election cycles, they became confined only to Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. The last 10 years have seen the Communists routed from both Bengal and Tripura. They are ruling in Kerala at the moment but, by multiple accounts, they won’t be seen ever again in that state. The Communists still have JNU. But any person who lives in the world of reality will admit that Communists have reached the end of their road in India as far as elections are concerned. They are down to 4%. Chances are that more people believe in a flat earth than in Communism. So how are the Communists making themselves count? By subverting democracy instead of participating in it. Fundamentally, there are two ways for them to achieve this despite their meagre 4% support base. And they are trying both. The first is outright terrorism, which is carried out by Communists operating in the deep forests of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Now, Communists operating above ground insist that they have absolutely nothing to do with those operating underground. They insist that CPI(XY) is different from CPI(XX) or CPI(YY) because of one letter here and there, even though the parties are descended from the same source, often founded by the same leaders/ideologues, have the same heroes and subscribe to the same set of beliefs. They even use variations of each other’s flags to show how close they are to each other. In election after election, people living in villages most affected by Communist terror vote in huge numbers to show their support for democracy. But a small number of Communists manage to stay relevant through sheer violence. The second way in which Communists make themselves count is by concentrating and taking advantage of absolute numbers instead of percentages. So what if their electoral support base is barely 4%? If you take 4% of India’s 125 crore people, that’s still 5 crore people! And yes, if you concentrate all your supporters and bring them out into the streets of *one* city, you can bring Delhi or Mumbai to a halt. This is exactly what is happening in Delhi today. A similar thing happened in Mumbai a few months ago. And it doesn’t help that media deliberately refuse to see the Communist colours of these marches. In Mumbai, the marchers carried a sea of red flags with the dreaded hammer and sickle symbol, but the media refused to see it and call it like it is. They called it a “farmers protest”. This is a common template. If ABVP were to protest it would be called an “ABVP protest” because that’s exactly what it is. But if a Communist students group were to protest, it is more likely to be simply called a “students protest” in the media. The same goes for “women’s protests”. The reason is that you would find that most journalists of today have roots in Communist student unions in college. But we have to call it what it is:  The Communists are trying to dictate terms by bringing all their supporters on the streets. What if a mainstream party like BJP or Congress tried something similar? About 30% of the Indians support the BJP. You can’t let 5 crore Communist supporters dictate terms just because 30 crore BJP supporters are not on the streets. That’s not a democracy. That’s  Are there no farmers, students, youths and women who vote for BJP? Or even for Congress?  And today as Communists again spill out in lakhs on Delhi streets, we the people need to identify their trick and recognize it. We have to promise ourselves not to fall for the emotional blackmail. Remember that the one lakh vocal Communists on the streets of Delhi today are here to silence the democratic mandate of 17 crore people who voted for BJP and PM Modi in the last election. 1 lakh vs 17 crores. Which is more democratic now? We cannot let the blackmail of the 1 lakh work its way through our collective consciousness. If Communists want their agenda to be followed, they have to do it the right way. They have to go to the people and make their case and get actual votes. But Communists know they can’t win that way. So they take the path of subversion. One person who is prominently leading the protests today came fourth or fifth in his seat when he tried to fight a Lok Sabha election. People don’t want them. We can’t let them impose themselves on our democracy simply because they know too many people who work in television. If we fall for blackmail today, we are setting ourselves up for more such subversion in the future.

19,OpIndia Staff,"This could now stoke a political slugfest, especially because the Sudipto Mundle panel, whose rosier estimates of the UPA-era growth has now been junked by the current government According to the revised GDP numbers released  by the government on Wednesday, India’s economic growth under the previous Congress-led coalition government was slower than estimated earlier and was never in double digits. The Central statistical office re-calibrated  the data to establish a better picture of the economy and thus lowered the GDP growth rates  for a majority of the previous 10 years of the UPA regime. According to the back-series data, by the NITI Aayog and the government’s statistical office, the Indian economy grew at an average of 6.67 per cent in the nine years ended March 31, 2014, when UPA was in power, slower than the 7.35 per cent achieved in the four years ended March 31, 2018, with Modi as the prime minister. It also shows that the highest growth rate the Indian economy has so far achieved is 8.5 per cent in 2010-11, against the 10.3 per cent which the Congress claimed using the older base.

Congress all this while has been repeatedly raising the issue of “mismanagement of the economy” and has been keen on using this point as its trump card in the campaign leading up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Owaisi was reacting  to reports of BJP President’s comment where the latter had claimed KC Rao was providing biryani to MIM men. Addressing a rally in Kukatpally, Owaisi said that he will immediately call KC Rao and ask him to send at least kalyani biryani (beef biryani) to Amit Shah. Kalyani biryani is another of the famous biryanis from Hyderabad made with either beef or buff. “Amit Shah said that KC Rao is sending biryani to Majlis men. We didn’t know that Amit Shah also liked biryani. If he is jealous that he as not fed biryani, then I would immediately call KC Rao that at least send him (Shah) a parcel of kalyani biryani,” Owaisi said to a cheering audience. Taking a dig at Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Nawaz Sharif’s residence, Owaisi even questioned Shah on what was Modi offered to eat at Sharif’s daughter’s wedding reception in Pakistan. “If someone is eating, why is your stomach aching? You can eat too,” Owaisi said. Owaisi is known for making such controversial statements. Earlier he had mocked  BJP’s Telangana manifesto proposal of distributing 1 lakh cows every year. A report by Times Now claimed that Owaisi stated that what he does with his cow is his choice. While other media reports claimed that Owaisi had stated  that he will keep his cow with the utmost respect, but the question is whether the BJP will give him one. Owaisi has often claimed that the BJP is anti-Muslim. He had recently stirred up a controversy implying that the government does not hire Muslims  for serving in the security forces. During the demonetisation in 2016, Owaisi had claimed  that the BJP government in the centre is not providing enough cash in the ATMs located in Muslim dominated areas.

I do not know what it is about this place that it produces people similar to Baghdadi (Islamic State founder) and Hafiz Saeed (Mumbai terror nattack mastermind and JuD chief). This place is not a seat of learning. It is a hub of terrorism,” he said . Singh made the remarks during his visit to Devikund to meet Seer Swami Brhmananand Saraswati at his ashram. He also visited a gurukul (Vedic school) in the town and said that the children, who received education at such institutions, never thought of violence and served the humanity after graduating from those great institutions. Singh said that no student from the Gurukul in Deoband has ever become a terrorist but it is difficult to state whether Darul Uloom is an institution of education or terrorism. He claimed  that terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Baghdadi both are alumni of Darul Uloom. He asked whether the Islamic school offers education about the betterment of human race or about the devastation of the race, because both its alumni Baghdadi and Saeed are killing humans. The Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Minister also appealed to the Muslims not to create obstacles in the construction of Ram temple. “I want to make an appeal to Muslims that these 100 crore Hindus are also their brothers. You erected three lakh mosques here and no one stopped you. But now don’t test Hindus’ patience. Lord Ram is my faith and his temple will be made in Ayodhya,” he added . Singh’s remarks have drawn flak from the Muslim clerics. Deobandi Ulema Qari Sayyid Ishaq Gora condemned his statement and demanded an immediate apology. “The statement by Giriraj Singh is baseless and unfortunate. He should take back his comment and apologise not only to a particular community but to the whole nation. The way he has given the baseless statement shows his wrong thinking.

As the election season begins in the country, the leftist propaganda website,  The Wire seems to be back to its usual propaganda of publishing fake news. The Wire, which has a complicated relationship with the truth has now published another report, where it invents fake data from a CSDS-Lokniti survey to claim that Congress President Rahul Gandhi is more liked than Narendra Modi in the Madhya Pradesh. The Wire, in its dishonest article , has claimed that the recently conducted Lokniti-CSDS Pre Election Surveys has pointed out that Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s likeability in Madhya Pradesh is much higher than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Wire in an urgency to invent new narrative right before the state goes to polls seems to have found it tough to comprehend the data published by the CSDS-Lokniti. It has used the data of these pre-election surveys and blatantly misused the data to propagate Rahul Gandhi’s fake ratings, while the actual survey predicts the opposite. The pre-election survey conducted  by Lokniti-CSDS in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh suggest completely opposite of what controversial website, The Wire claims in its report. The survey suggests that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was found to be highly liked in all three states. It must be mentioned here the CSDS does not have a very good track record  of predicting elections and has often been highly skewed towards the Congress and its allies. In fact, Yogendra Yadav is himself seen as an anti-Modi public figure. The Lokniti-CSDS survey predicts that PM Narendra Modi’s popularity is high in Madhya Pradesh compared to Rahul Gandhi, opposite to what The Wire suggests. In the survey, 39%  and 25% of the respondents have either “highly liked Modi” or “somewhat like Modi” respectively compared to 33% and 30% to Rahul Gandhi in the same criteria. The data shows that Narendra Modi is leading Rahul Gandhi against the narrative published by the website, which says “Gandhi is liked more than Prime Minister Narendra Modi” in Madhya Pradesh. The Lokniti-CSDS suggests that Prime Minister Modi’s popularity might be slightly lesser than Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, but its higher than the likeability of the Congress President Rahul Gandhi. Interestingly, for the post of Chief Minister, Shivraj Singh Chauhan despite facing anti-incumbency of 15 years rule in the state tops the list of preference for the post of chief minister with 37% compared to 24% for Scindia.

BJP President Amit Shah yesterday compared  the Mahagathbandhan, the proposed alliance of opposition parties against the BJP, with a band of thieves. He said that the Opposition accuses Prime Minister Modi of corruption while actually, it is the Opposition partied that looted the wealth of the country. Addressing an election rally in Rajasthan, Shah labelled the Mahagathbandhan as a band of 40 thieves, who were thrown out of the villages they looted by a newly-appointed ‘chowkidar’ (Prime Minister Modi). “All of them united and told the villagers that the chowkidar is the thief. The villagers beat them up and banished them from the village. On the one hand, this Mahagathbandhan is a unity of those who loot the wealth of the public through corrupt means. On the other hand, there is the Narendra Modi government that has safeguarded the nation,” Shah said . Shah attacked the Congress Party for indulging in corruption that spanned from outer space to below the earth. “In space they did the 2G scam, in the skies they did the AgustaWestland helicopter scam, on land they did the Adarsh Society scam, the scam involving the purchase of submarines spread their corruption to the seas and they stole coal from below the earth. Their corruption can be seen everywhere, today they are questioning us?” Shah said . “During his 10-year term, intruders would enter the country from all fronts and carry out their acts of terrorism and no one used to do anything. During Modi ji’s government, after terrorists killed and burnt our soldiers alive in Uri, he directed the Army to carry out surgical strikes. Our Army exacted revenge for our soldiers’ deaths by carrying out that operation in Pakistan,” said  Shah criticising Congress for their poor handling of terrorist activities during former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government. Shah spoke about how Modi-led government’s initiative to introduce the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam led to over 40 lakh immigrants being recognised as immigrants and promised to cleanse the entire nation of such illegal immigrants if BJP is elected to power in Rajasthan.

35,OpIndia Staff,"The poster features Congress President Rahul Gandhi, senior Congress leaders Sachin Pilot, Ashok Gehlot and other Congress leaders but, ironically, not a single woman. In poll-bound Rajasthan, Congress has tried to take the ‘respect women’ route. A poster has gone viral on social media which claims that if Congress comes to power, women will get respect. The poster features Congress President Rahul Gandhi, senior Congress leaders Sachin Pilot, Ashok Gehlot and other Congress leaders but, ironically, not a single woman. We’ve earlier pointed out how women empowerment is a mere propaganda  tool for Congress. While most arguments of Congress regarding their contribution to women empowerment are centred around Indira Gandhi, her cabinet never had any notable women as a cabinet minister. There have been some Ministers of States but her regime did not see another major female political leader emerging or given a substantial role of a Union Minister. Sushila Nayyar was health minister for a year, but she was sacked soon. In fact, it was Congress which punched the biggest hole in women empowerment with overturning the Shah Bano case. While the Supreme Court of India had granted Shah Bano the right to maintenance, the Rajiv Gandhi led Congress government in the centre succumbed  to the possible confrontations from the Muslim Personal Law Board. Rajiv Gandhi’s government passed a law in the name of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 and basically reversed the Supreme Court Verdict. The SC verdict that could have been the harbinger of equal rights to all Muslim Women as the rest of the women of this country was overturned in the name of Muslim appeasement. Moving on to more recent times, when the Narendra Modi led government batted for the abolition of Triple Talaaq in a bid to empower Muslim women who were being given triple talaq for frivolous reasons and being rendered homeless, Congress not only tried to stall the bill and often displayed  double standards, senior Congress leaders even tried  to justify their opposition to the bill in ridiculous ways. Last year, during the run-up to the Gujarat elections, Rahul Gandhi had made sexist comments  saying that women associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) do not “wear shorts”. Because only by “wearing shorts” does a woman get empowered. And Rahul Gandhi and his party talking about women empowerment and respecting women across as a bit of an irony. Recently, NSUI President Fairoz Khan, who was recently accused  by a woman member of NSUI of abetting female members of the organisation to make sexual relationship with him in lieu of political posts, was seen on the posters  of a ‘Girls’ Convention’ held in Indore. Earlier, when allegations of sexual harassment against Congress IT cell member Chirag Patnaik had emerged, Congress IT cell head Divya Spandana had expressed ‘full support’  to Patnaik.

36,OpIndia Staff,"The ACB has asked for more time to further probe the inconsistencies and begin criminal action. The Anti Corruption Bureau has laid  incriminating charges against the ex-deputy CM Ajit Pawar in the Maharashtra irrigation scam. The ACB has highlighted gross lapses on the part of Pawar and other officials which lead to the scam, as per reports. Estimated to be around Rs 70,000 crore, the scam is associated to the purported corruption in approval and implementation of disparate irrigation projects in Maharashtra during the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) rule. Pawar was at the helm of the irrigation department on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2014 during the Congress-NCP coalition rule in Maharashtra. The ACB has filed  24 FIRs against the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) officials, contractors and their power of attorney holders. Sanjay Barve, Director General, ACB, filed an affidavit before the Nagpur bench of the high court on Tuesday in response to an appeal filed by an NGO, Janmanch. The NGO raised grave concerns over glaring inconsistencies in irrigation projects managed by the Vidharba and Konkan Irrigation Development Corporations. The scam was described as a “weird case of conspiracy” in the affidavit. “Those involved in the corruption who caused a great dent to public exchequer are simply hiding behind the framework and relaying their blame on others,” it said. The affidavit also leveled serious charges of inordinate delays, cost escalations and non-realisation of projects undertaken by the Vidarbha and Konkan irrigation development corporations under the tenure of Ajit Pawar as minister for water resources department. “The ACB has noticed that large irregularities have been perpetrated in many of these tenders with shocking similarity,” Barve said in his affidavit. During inquisition, Pawar blamed secretary-level officers for their recommendations. He said that most of the decisions were taken at field level. “It is observed that the minister in chargee of the water resources department passes the buck on to the officers,” the affidavit said. The ACB further stated that it had solicited the views of the water resources department’s principal secretary about Pawar’s role as the minister. In his response to the ACB, the secretary said Rule 10 of the Maharashtra Government Rules of Business and Instructions was self-explanatory and that nothing can be added. Responsibility, according to the Rule 10 of the Maharashtra Government Rules of Business and Instructions lies squarely on the minister in-charge of the department for ‘all the business and disposal thereof appertaining to the said department’. The ACB also said that officials of the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) received graft and monetary rewards for contractors.The affidavit alleged that VIDC’s officials flouted the procedures, acted against the government’s interest, extended patronage to a select group of contractors and ensured that they got monetary benefits. The ACB has asked for more time to further probe the inconsitencies and begin criminal action. The affidavit described the perpetrators as ‘musicians’ playing a symphony in perfect harmony with each other.

37,OpIndia Staff,"BJP and Congress came together earlier this year to form the Chakma Autonomous District Council in Mizoram Mizoram goes to poll today to elect its next government. The main contest is expected between incumbent Congress and Mizo National Front (MNF), but Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) and BJP are also important players in the elections. None of these parties has any pre-poll alliance. Unlike other states in North East where BJP had formed pre-poll alliances and won elections, BJP has decided to go alone in Mizoram. Although Congress won 34 out of 40 seats in 2013 elections, this time it is expected to come down substantially, due to anti-incumbency factor and the cascading effect of declining fortune of the Congress party at the national level. Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla has said that Congress is open form post-poll alliance with like-minded parties excluding BJP and MNF. On the other hand, North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma has made a very significant comment by saying  that BJP has worked with all other three parties in the state and there is nothing to hide in that. According to Sarma, Mizoram Congress is a different entity separate from the Congress party, and since the time of Indira Gandhi, Mizoram Congress is considered different from All India Congress Committee (AICC). This may like a strange comment coming from the Congress leader turned staunch critic of Rahul Gandhi, but politics in northeastern states is different from the national level. In the region, politics is more personality driven rather than party driven. In the states of the northeast, it is regular to merge an entire party unit into another one, and parties form alliances which seems impossible, like a BJP-Congress alliance. There is a BJP-Congress alliance in the state, although not for the assembly election, its there for an autonomous council. In April this year, the election for the 20 seats of Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) took place in the state. In the election, MNF won eight seats, Congress won six seats and BJP won five seats. Thus, no party won a majority to form the council, and an alliance was necessary between any two parties. And in an unusual political equation formed by local leaders, the elected council members of Congress and BJP came together. BJP leader Santi Jiban Chakma became  the chief executive member (CEM) of the council, with the support of the Congress councillors. Mizoram is a Christian majority state with Church having a considerable influence in politics of the state. The Church has openly taken an anti-BJP stand in the elections, even expelling  its members for joining BJP. That is the reason other parties are not willing to form any pre-poll alliance in the state. Mizo National Front is a member of NDA in the national level, but even they don’t want to be seen with BJP in the state. BJP is in power in six of the seven states in the northeast, Mizoram being the exception. There are four BJP chief ministers in the region, in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Tripura, while BJP is part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya.

38,OpIndia Staff,"Income Tax officer SK Srivastava told CBI that P Chidambaram routed the bribe in Aircel-Maxi deal through NDTV With CBI getting sanction  to prosecute former union minister P Chidambaram in the Aircel-Maxis case, the investigation into the case has entered its final phase. P Chidambaram and his son Karti are accused of receiving a bribe in exchange for illegal approval to the Aircel-Maxis deal granted by the then finance minister. With the case finally gaining momentum, it is time to revisit some other aspects of the case. One of that is the alleged involvement of NDTV. Income Tax officer Sanjay Kumar Srivastava, who has been exposing  financial irregularities by NDTV, had made a sensational claim that P Chidambaram had parked his bribe money in the controversial media house. In an 88 page letter written to the CBI chief in April this year, Srivastava had said that “NDTV Ltd. needs to be investigated over parking of bribe of US $40 million by Maxis and its owner T. Ananda Krishnan (accused in the Aircel-Maxis case) on behalf of P Chidambaram and Karti P. Chidambaram for obtaining FIPB approval in Rs.3500 crores. Aircel-Maxis deal fraudulently claiming the proposal for Rs.180 crores only when gross value of the proposal was to be considered and which has been hushed up by certain IRS officers in lieu of bribe paid by NDTV Ltd.” As per FDI policy in force at that time, FDI proposals above ₹600 crore needed to be cleared by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), while FDI below this amount could be approved by the finance ministry. According to allegations, the Aircel-Maxis deal was for ₹3,500 crores, but it was shown as the share price of ₹180 crore and share premium of ₹3320 crore, and approval was sought for only the ₹180 crore part. As it was below the limit for CCEA approval, finance minister P Chidambaram had sanctioned the approval. In return for this favour, Karti Chidambaram was paid $40 million, which was routed through NDTV Ltd, Srivastava alleges. He has written that the transaction was “disguised as a purchase of shares (49% indirect stake whatever that may mean) of NDTV Lifestyle Holdings Pvt. Ltd wholly owned by NDTV Networks Plc, UK which was wholly owned by NDTV Networks BV, Holland and which in turn was wholly owned by NDTV Ltd, India and all of which were sham letterbox companies owned and floated by NDTV Ltd to launder the proceeds of crime bring the bribe paid to the Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram and Karti by various entities by All Astro Asia Networks Plc, UK wholly owned subsidiary of the Maxis Ltd an T Ananda Krishnan.” The Income Tax officer goes on to add that “the fraudulent nature of the transaction between NDTV and Maxis is borne out from the fact that Maxis Ltd never cared to carry its investment or seek any return on that or get involved in the affairs of the company which was 49% owned by Maxis Ltd & had just forgotten their huge investment of about Rs.200 crores with NDTV Ltd and its subsidiaries. The case was hushed up by the NDTV Ltd by paying a bribe to the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers.” Srivastava has noted that CBI is investigating multiple cases of bribes paid by NDTV to Income Tax officers and embezzlement of ₹1,46,82,836 from government account by NDTV. According to him, these cases and the case of bribe received by Karti Chidambaram are interrelated and interconnected. Because P Chidambaram was the final authority involved to grant necessary approvals and he is the common thread in all criminal conspiracies and bribe transactions, says the letter. Srivastava attached many internal documents of NDTV in his 88-page letter in support of his allegations. He had requested CBI that the cases of bribes paid by NDTV to I-T officers and bribe received by Karti should be handled by the same division of CBI, as they are related to each other.

42,Sambit Nayak,"While Syed Modi and his family never got justice, the nation lost a bright star in the field of Badminton.  Badminton World Federation (BWF) just concluded the last marquee tournament of the year, Syed Modi International Badminton Tournament at Lucknow, before world tour finals to be held at Guangzhou. Indians had a fabulous run at the tournament with 4 out of 5 finals having Indian representation. India’s final score at Syed Modi stands as 3 Silver and 1 Gold. Definitely, a smashing way to end an otherwise disappointing year for Indian Badminton. Syed Modi tournament started as a national level tournament in 1991. It got BWF recognition in 2004. From 2009, it got Grand Prix status and has been witnessing participation from eminent players from China, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Denmark among others. However, do we know who Syed Modi was and why we have a BWF tournament named after him? Probably the only person who has a BWF tournament named after him until 2017 when the Indian Open got renamed to Dr Akhilesh Das Gupta Indian Open. Syed Modi was one of the most promising players of India hailing from Uttar Pradesh. Few of his biggest laurels include Gold at CWG in 1982 at Australia and Bronze at Asiad in 1982 held at Delhi at the mere age of 20. He has won several European circuit championship as well. An Arjuna Awardee, Syed Modi was 8 times national champion consecutively from 1980 to 1987. On the evening of 28 July 1988, at the age of 26, Modi was shot dead as he was coming out of KD Singh Babu stadium, Lucknow after a practice session. A brilliant career was cut short as Syed Modi, hailed as the next Prakash Padukone of India , died an unfortunate and untimely death. Soon after the murder, UP police arrested 7 persons including Modi’s wife Ameeta Singh, Congress leader Sanjay Singh who was a close friend and classmate of Rajiv Gandhi and another Congress leader outlaw-turned-politician, former MLA from Rae Bareli Akhilesh Singh for criminal conspiracy and murder. As it was a high profile murder case where the accused were powerful politicians, for the fear of scuttling the investigation, the case got shifted to CBI. CBI charge sheet named all 3 along with few others and hinted at the extra marital affair of Ameeta with Sanjay Singh to be the root cause of the murder. However, they denied all such charges. Later, Rajiv’s friend Sanjay Singh got his name as well as Ameeta’s name dropped from CBI charge sheet and went on to marry Ameeta in 1990 while still being legally married to Garima Singh, a relative of VP Singh. Garima filed a case alleging polygamy to which Sanjay replied that he had sent divorce notice to Garima’s address to which Garima never replied. Hence court granted him an ex-parte divorce. The case has been dragging on to this date with Sanjay still legally married to Garima but lives with Ameeta. Marital discord started in Modi’s life soon after the marriage. Ameeta and Syed belonged to a different religion, social strata and culture. Despite strong opposition from both families, they got married in 1984. However, differences soon started cropping up owning to professional jealousy and adulterous nature of Ameeta. While Modi went on to win several national championships, Ameeta had to take a break as she was expecting their first child in 1987. The gaps widened to a point where Syed Modi suspected that the child is not his. Marital discord affected his game as well and he lost his first ever senior nationals title in 1988. Soon they started living separately. On 28th of July 1988, Modi was shot dead in front of the stadium as he was coming out after a practice session. So what happened to Rajiv’s friend and his new wife after being charged with heinous crimes such as criminal conspiracy and murder? Of course, Congress rewarded him with Rajya Sabha nomination in 1990 while the wife got an MLA ticket from Amethi assembly constituency. Sanjay Singh has been a Lok Sabha member in 1998 and 2009. He is incumbent RS MP from Assam. Ameeta contested UP assembly elections in 2017 from Amethi on an INC ticket against estranged wife of Sanjay, Garima Singh who was contesting as a BJP nominee. Both declared Sanjay Singh to be their husband in respective election affidavits. Garima won the elections by a margin of 5065 votes. While Syed Modi and his family never got justice, the nation lost a bright star in the field of Badminton. The perpetrators were never brought to book because they knew all the right people. While Badminton Authority of India, in memory of the legend, started Syed Modi Championships which has now become an international BWF event, one should draw solace from the fact that Congress party has not renamed it as Rajiv Gandhi memorial Badminton tournament.",2018-11-27,"Badminton,Congress,INC,Murder,Syed Modi,UPA","As Syed Modi tournament draws to a close, here is who Syed Modi was and what Congress did to him",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/as-syed-modi-tournament-draws-to-a-close-here-is-who-syed-modi-was-and-what-congress-did-to-him/
43,Jhankar Mohta,"Imran Khan has been a terror apologist and had been sympathetic to the Taliban in the past. On the day India reminisced the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, wherein 166 people were killed by 10 Pakistani terrorists, the Congress Minister, Navjot Singh Sidhu, once again brandishing his admiration for Pakistan, called  the Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan a ‘Farishta’ (angel). While yesterday, Punjab Chief Minister, Captain Amarinder Singh declined  Pakistan’s invitation for Kartarpur corridor foundation stone laying ceremony citing continued terror attacks in Punjab, his minister Navjot Singh Siddhu not only accepted  the invitation but also called Imran Khan an angel. He also went on to say  that the “real credit” for initiation of the Kartarpur corridor goes to the Pakistan PM. “The real credit for the corridor goes to Imran Khan, and also to the people, who prayed for several years for its construction,” Sidhu told  While Sidhu thanked the Indian Government for its initiative he went on to applaud the Pakistani government giving them the “real credit”. India and Pakistan announced  on Thursday that they will build a corridor on their respective sides to let Sikh pilgrims visit the iconic Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur on the banks of the river Ravi in the neighbouring country. The plan to build a corridor on the Indian side leading to the border near the gurdwara was among a slew of proposals cleared during a Cabinet meeting to mark Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary in 2019. While Sidhu was busy applauding Pakistan, the Sikhs in America have hailed the Indian government’s decision  to build a religious corridor linking border district of Gurdaspur with historic Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara in Pakistan. Earlier too the Congress minister of tourism and cultural affairs in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu had bagged  a lot of criticism when he, disregarding the Indian sentiments had gone and attended the oath-taking ceremony of Imran Khan. Though Sidhu’s controversial hug to the Pakistan Army Chief had created a tremendous uproar, the consternation left him unfazed. He even promised to throw in a kiss  next time if the corridor was opened. Justifying his acts, Sidhu was also quick to grab the opportunity  to credit the Kartarpur corridor development to this controversial hug. Though the Pakistan government had earlier discredited  his claim. It is worthy to note here that Imran Khan has been a terror apologist and had been sympathetic to the Taliban  in the past. Pakistan has been long known to help spread terrorism  in India and kills hundreds of Indians every year. While India remembers the 26/11 Mumbai attacks with pain, Pakistan has not only been aiding terrorists to wage war against India, the Imran Khan government has now allowed the sanctions against UN-designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed  to lapse. Saeed is considered the mastermind of the 26/11 attacks. Congress’ fondness for Pakistan has many a time laid exposed. Congress ministers on many occasions in the past have praised Pakistan. Pakistanis have also on one occasion reverted  back by praising Congress President Rahul Gandhi for slamming PM Modi. Not to forget how senior Congress leader, Mani Shankar Aiyar while expressing his love for Pakistan, had blamed  India for stopping the dialogue between the two nations. He also went on to say in an interview that to start a dialogue between to nations, Prime Minister Modi needs to be removed  from his post. He said, “Pakistan ke saath acche rishte banane hain toh inhe (Modi government) hataiye, humko leke aiye”. Moreover, in February 2012 Mani Shankar Aiyer had gone on to refer Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Sahid as ‘Saahab’. Former Union Minister of External Affairs, Salman Khurshid, too, on his visit  to Pakistan, had hailed Pakistan as a democratic country and slammed Modi government. Congress veteran leader P Chidambaram, last year created a stir by reiterating Pakistan’s stance by backing  greater autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir. He had in 2016, also raised  serious doubts over the degree of involvement of the hanged Pakistani terrorist, Afzal Guru, in the 2001 Parliament attacks. Recently, Congress was found promoting  a ‘Modi hatao desh bachao’ ad on Facebook in Pakistan. When Congress was called out on the same, the party decided to blatantly lie  after quietly deleting the post. Congress’ crush over Pakistan was further uncovered last year when Congress after an initial denial, accepted  Modi’s direct allegation that a secret meeting took place involving certain Pakistani and Congresspeople, during the height of the Gujarat elections. What is actually interesting here is that even though Pakistan PM Imran Khan called the Prime Minister of India ‘a small man in big office’, Congress minister Sidhu is head over heels praising the Pakistani PM with words like ‘an angel’.",2018-11-27,"BJP,Congress,Kartarpur,navjot singh sidhu,Pakistan,pakistan government,pakistan sponsored terrorism","On 26/11 anniversary, Congress’ Navjot Sidhu calls Imran Khan ‘an angel’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/on-26-11-anniversary-congress-navjot-sidhu-calls-imran-khan-an-angel/
44,OpIndia Staff,"PM Modi responded to personal attacks launched against him by Congress leaders. As the state of Rajasthan gears up to vote for the state Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a massive rally  in Alwar, Rajasthan today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his campaign speech, came down heavily on Congress Party for not only resorting to casteist slur  against him but also for dragging his family  to politically attack him. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Congress for its dubious stand on Ayodhya issue and he continued by describing how the Congress has created an atmosphere of fear  for the judiciary in the country by threatening Chief Justice of India with an impeachment motion  whenever one of them wants to hear the Ayodhya case. “The Congress creates an atmosphere of fear for the judiciary. They tell the Supreme Court to delay the Ayodhya hearing due to 2019 elections. They do everything possible to impeach the Chief Justice. How can such things be accepted,” PM Modi said with a reference to the opposition attempt  to impeach former Chief Justice Dipak Misra earlier this year. The Prime Minister also attacked the Congress for indulging in caste politics and said the party has touched a “new low”, as PM Modi referred to the series of casteist slurs  and personal abuse he received from senior Congress leaders. He went on to say that Congress party resorted to caste politics since country’s independence and said that Congress party deliberately sidelined B R Ambedkar but presented  Bharat Ratna to themselves, especially to one family. PM Modi also said that former Congress Dalit leader Babu Jagjeevan Ram was humiliated by the Congress party after he stood against Indira Gandhi for imposing emergency. During his speech, the PM never missed a chance to attack the Congress for indulging in hate politics. He said that Congress leaders resort to personal abuse when they do not have any positive agenda to discuss the development. He challenged Congress party to debate him on policies and developmental issue rather than indulging in derogatory attacks. He slammed  senior Congress leader Raj Babbar for referring left-wing terrorists as ‘Revolutionaries’. Expressing disappointed over deaths of security officials in Chattisgarh due to Naxal attacks, the Prime Minister said that Congress party terming Naxalites as ‘Revolutionaries’ should be a shame for the party and its leaders. In his speech, he also referred to the recent bizarre incident  which took place in Rajasthan, when a senior Congress leader not only stopped a party worker from chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ but forced him to chant slogans praising Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. “For the Congress party, there is a  PM Modi concluded his speech by mentioning the major developmental schemes initiated by the BJP government in the Centre and in Rajasthan led by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. He said the only mantra that his party fights its elections on, is ‘Vikas’ (development) and so the people must vote to keep in mind the future of their kids.

45,OpIndia Staff,"One user on Wikipedia is vandalising articles and declaring Arvind Kejriwal as PM 2019 In the 2014 general elections, Arvind Kejriwal was supposed to be the biggest hurdle in the way of Narendra Modi becoming prime minister. When Modi chose to contest from Varanasi, Kejriwal also filed nomination from that Lok Sabha seat, with various AAP leaders declaring that Kejriwal winning the seat was a foregone conclusion. In a similar case of high expectation, someone has gone ahead and declared that Arvind Kejriwal will be the Prime Minister. Not on some official platform, but on Wikipedia. Today at 1:48 PM, the Wikipedia page of Arvind Kejriwal was altered , and the words  On 19 November, this same user had edited the page and inserted the line “Also PM 2019 watch An Insignificant man movie on YouTube on kejriwal ji” in the first paragraph of the article. He had added the same line in the Wiki page of Aam Admi Party also. These edits were removed by master editors of Wikipedia, but the latest edit on the Arvind Kejriwal page remains. Looking into the profile of the user named Amayvijay, it can be seen  that the account is active on Wikipedia since 6 On 6th November, the user attacked the wiki page of Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium several times, changing the name to Ekana International Cricket Stadium. On 6th November, Uttar Pradesh government had renamed the stadium to Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium. Accordingly, the wiki page was updated to reflect the new name. But the user Amayvijay was obviously not happy with this renaming, because he kept renaming the name of the stadium back to its original name, which was corrected by other editors every time he did it. In a few edits, the user also added the words “by Akhilesh Yadav” after the name of the stadium in the article, which was subsequently removed by others. This user had also edited the page for Ahmedabad, and inserted  Ahmed as the city’s other name, removing Amdavad. After declaring Arvind Kejriwal the PM in 2019, Amayvijay proceeded to vandalise the wiki page for 2019 general elections. The page contained results of various opinion polls for the 2019 election, and the sidebar had 2014 results of BJP and Congress with photos of Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. This is a big injustice to Arvind Kejriwal, thought Amayvijay, and inserted detail of the Delhi CM there. These were the insertions in the page: leader name: Arvind Kejriwal PM 2019, party name: Aam Aadmi party Honest, and alliance name: Most Honest Alliance.

46,OpIndia Staff,"The Congress party has been alleging possible EVM tampering and have also claimed that professional hackers have been employed to influence the poll results.  A Congress worker has reportedly  died after being outdoors for long hours guarding the strong room in Kunkuri district, Jashpur, Chhattisgarh, where the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were kept after Chhattisgarh completed its two-phase voting here on November 20. According to reports, a room in a Government high school, which is situated 4 km away from the main city has been converted into strong room where the machines are securely kept post polls. Fearing machine tampering, Congress worker Pankaj Minj, a resident of Kaliba, along with few other Congress workers were reportedly guarding the room. Pankaj was taken to the district hospital after he suddenly fell sick on Saturday. After reaching the hospital his condition deteriorated and later he died. It is believed that Pankaj died because of the cold. The Congress party has been alleging possible EVM tampering and have also claimed  that professional hackers have been employed to influence the poll results. Adding further to these allegations, Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) Chief Bhupesh Baghel instructed the workers to monitor EVMs outside the Strong Room on Thursday. BJP hit out at Congress for this ludicrous remark saying that these were all excuses of the Congress party who are fearing their possible defeat in the elections. State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Dharamlal Kaushik said, “By making such baseless allegations they (Congress) have accepted their defeat even before the result was out”. Since last year, after the five state assembly elections concluded, various political parties accompanied by several media houses have maliciously built up this paranoia and propaganda about the alleged tampered EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). On 11th March 2017, as the election results were being declared and the BJP alliance swept the Uttar Pradesh polls, Mayawati was the first politician who had come out and blamed  the EVMs for BJP’s victory. Slowly, other political parties too started raking up the EVM issue and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal took it to the next level after spreading an outright  lie about the machines that were equipped with the VVPAT system. Congress soon joined the bandwagon and created the controversy about EVMs in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, which turned out to be a lie . However, that did not deter the party, which went ahead and demanded  an immediate ban on the EVMs. However, many Congress leaders have also come out and spoken against  its own party’s malicious attempt to weave such conspiracy theories and even the Election commission had explained in detail  why EVMs can’t be hacked. A general consensus on the use of EVMs was arrived at twenty years ago in 1998. The Congress party was an integral part of this process throughout. Today when it is retracting  its own support to EVMs, and continuously building false agenda’s over tampering of EVM’s, one can probably understand, that this is only due to its failure in successive assembly elections. Unfortunately, now these conspiracy theories have claimed a life.",2018-11-25,"2018 Assembly Elections,Arvind Kejriwal,BJP,Chhatisgarh elections 2018,Congress,Conspiracy theory,election commission,EVM,EVM tampering,mayawati,Sanjay Nirupam",Congress worker dies of cold after being outdoors for hours ‘protecting EVMs’,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/congress-worker-dies-of-cold-after-being-outdoors-for-hours-protecting-evms/
47,OpIndia Staff,"Reddy blamed the TRS supremo claiming that because he was a strong contender, the Chief Minister was instigating the police to harass him mentally and physically. Amidst the Telangana assembly election pressure, it was reported  that Congress candidate for Gajwel assembly constituency, Vanteru Pratap Reddy allegedly made a futile self-immolation attempt to prevent the police from conducting a search in his house at Kompally on the outskirts of Hyderabad late on Monday night. Vanteru Pratap Reddy, who is contesting against Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president and chief minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, was later arrested  for obstructing the police from discharging their duties. The police informed that a case of attempted suicide, obstructing public servants in discharge of their duty and other charges under relevant sections have been registered against Reddy. According to Cyberabad Police, the Election Commission had received a complaint from TRS leaders earlier in the day that Reddy and his followers were distributing money to people at his Kompally residence. A flying squad comprising election officials along with a team led by Balanagar deputy commissioner of police, Padmaja, reached Reddy’s house late on Monday to conduct searches in his house following an instruction from the poll body. Reddy, along with his family members and supporters reportedly resisted  the team’s entry, alleging that the police was trying to intimidate him and his workers in the name of such search operations. While the team was executing the task, Reddy immediately doused himself with petrol and tried to set himself on fire, however, the police managed to thwart the attempt. Though nothing substantial was found during the search, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Balanagar Zone) PV Padmaja told PTI that “Reddy along with his supporters misbehaved with the officials on duty and also with police.” Meanwhile Reddy blamed  the TRS supremo claiming that because he was a strong contender, the Chief Minister was instigating the police to harass him mentally and physically. Supporters of the Congress candidate gathered near his house and started shouting slogans against the TRS government and the chief minister. As the situation turned tense, police took Reddy into custody and warned the party workers against coming in there way while they were performing their duty. After an intense search for over an hour, the police left saying they did not find any money or valuables at the house. A day before this incident Reddy held a hunger strike in front of the office of the Election Returning Officer in Gajwel. He had alleged that his phones were being tapped and that his supporters were being harassed by the TRS leaders. Gajwel Police arrested him and took him away though they let him off later. But Reddy got himself admitted to a corporate hospital in Secunderabad complaining of low blood pressure.

48,K Bhattacharjee,"The fact that the mainstream media allows the Left to get away by proclaiming protests like Kisan Mukti March to be ""Farmers' protests"" instead of calling it ""Left protests for farmers' rights"" as it quite clearly is, only goes on to show that the media is party to the Left agenda. As per reports , thousands of farmers shall march to the capital this week in a Kisan Mukti March demanding a minimum support price for their crops and freedom from debt. The march to be held on November 29 and 30 is being organized by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). Mainstream media reports conveniently fail to mention the political affiliation of the AIKSSC. One glimpse at their website, however, makes it abundantly clear that they are merely a front for communist politics. Even the ‘about us’ section of AIKSCC’s website fails to mention their political leanings. It says , “All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) was formed in late June 2017, in response to the spontaneous struggles of farmers in different states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, for debt relief and remunerative prices. This is the first such broad-based alliance in India at the national level, for securing farmers’ rights on two fronts to begin with.” Then a separate section lists its constituent organizations . It’s these constituent organizations that make their political affiliation abundantly clear. Jai Kisan Andolan (JKA) and former AAP politician Yogendra Yadav’s Swaraj Abhiyan are two of them. It’s unclear why the two have been listed as different entities when the former is an initiative  of the latter. The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) is another communist  frontal organization affiliated to attached to communist political parties. The All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha (AIKMS) is associated  with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Akhil Gogoi’s Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) is also a member organization of the AIKSCC. The All India Kisan Mahasabha (AIKM), All India Khet Mazdoor Kisan Sabha (AIKMKS), AIKS (Canning Street) are Left  organizations. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana (SSS) was open to allying  with the Shiv Sena if it pulled out of the alliance with the BJP in Maharashtra. The AIKSCC has over a hundred constituent members and a good portion of them appear to be directly associated with the Left. The working group of the AIKSCC, which has 20 members, provides a clearer picture of its political leanings. Akhil Gogoi, Dr Ashish Mittal of AIKMS, Atul Kumar Anjaan of AIKS, who is also a prominent leader of the CPI, Raja Ram Singh of AIKM, Hannan Nollah from AKIS (Canning Street) all align towards the Left. Avik Saha and Yogendra Yadav from Swaraj Abhiyan also have left political leanings although they aren’t associated with any communist parties. Medha Patkar from the National Alliance of People’s Movements (NAPM), a vocal opponent  of Prime Minister and founder of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, is also a member of the working group of AIKSCC. Raju Shetti is from SSS, another anti-BJP front. Thus we have 9 of the 20 members with very prominent anti-Modi political leanings. And among those 9, apart from the SSS, the rest have very strong Leftist political inclinations. There are several others who are related to the Left too. The CPIM’s role in protests in Maharashtra is also well known. As per Financial Express , the Kisan March saw “thousands of protesting farmers led by CPI(M)-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (AIKS) walked 180 km for six days to reach Mumbai to press for their demands.” Interestingly, an October 15 report on CPIM’s website mentions  that “Fresh round of kisan agitational movements are in the offing”. Therefore, the protests to be held on November 29 and 30 appear clearly to be protests by leftists. Every political party has the right to protest on behalf of an aggrieved community. That is the essence of democratic politics. But to pretend as if the protests are not motivated by politics is dishonest. The fact that the mainstream media allows the Left to get away by proclaiming it to be “Farmers’ protests” instead of calling it “Left protests for farmers’ rights” as it quite clearly it only goes on to show that the media is party to the Left agenda. In the same manner, the media allows Leftists to get away with dishonesty by labelling Pride Marches  as events organized by the LGBT community when in reality, those are events are organized by leftists to further their own political agenda.",2018-11-27,"CPI,CPIM,Kisan Long march,Left propaganda,mainstream media",Leftists to protest against Modi government under the garb of ‘Farmer rights’ in Kisan Mukti March,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/leftists-to-protest-against-modi-government-under-the-garb-of-farmer-rights-in-kisan-mukti-march/
49,Nirwa Mehta,"AAP has ended up being exactly what they promised they won't be, sometimes even surpassing the existing political parties in setting a lower bar.  As Aam Aadmi Party completes six years of existence today, the party which came to power on the non-corruption plank has morphed into its own parody. A party which started off on the plank of anti-corruption initially saw the most dynamic citizens associate themselves with the lofty ideals espoused by it, but soon, the charm withered. Aam Aadmi Party is now associated with unending theatrics and a lust for power that it fails to get beyond Delhi. The feeling that anti-corruption was only a ploy to get power grew and peaked when AAP allied with Congress, the very party whose leaders, Kejriwal said, should be jailed for corruption. With no underlying ideology except deceit and drama, the party has started to disintegrate only six years into its existence. While AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal kicked out founding members like Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav, few other staunch supporters like Ashutosh  and Ashish Khetan  too quit the political outfit. While rumours were rife that the duo quit the outfit because they were denied the Rajya Sabha tickets, Khetan clarified his stand on Twitter. He said that he wanted to go back to his legal practice and not stay involved in active politics. AAP senior leader Kumar Vishwas, too, has let his displeasure known , quite publicly. AAP rebel leader Kapil Mishra  has turned into a very vocal critic and quite a pain for the Aam Aadmi Party by taking on the CM. AAP Punjab unit is also going through a crisis  of its own after their Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly was removed from the post leading to a sense of discontent growing within the party. In September, AAP dissolved  its overseas outfits with immediate effect, much to the dismay of Punjabi NRI supporters who felt that dissent was muzzled in the party. They had accused that the party wants to keep only ‘yes-men’ around who owe allegiance to Bhagwant Mann, comedian turned politician from Sangrur and Delhi. The party has also been losing out on its very vocal supporters. In 2014, Gul Panag, had fought on AAP ticket from Chandigarh. However, in February this year, she had revealed AAP’s dangerous pandering to Khalistanis . She had said how AAP had allegedly courted Khalistanis, despite her warnings. Recently, former BJP leader Harmohan Dhawan joined Aam Aadmi Party and it is believed  he is one of the frontrunners for the Chandigarh seat for the upcoming general elections. AAP leaders’ disappointment with the party is not the only thing that is troubling AAP. Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal has created an army of crass zombies who think they’re being disruptive in the Indian political landscape when they’re actually just being a nuisance. AAP supporters, as well as leaders, have been caught making insensitive remarks  on various leaders including Delhi LG Anil Baijal, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. The insensitivity at display is alarming. While AAP leader Alka Lamba has displayed lack of remorse  after stalling rescue operations during a fire at Chandni Chowk, Delhi, by laughing about it on Twitter, Arvind Kejriwal’s wife, Sunita Kejriwal had given a veiled threat  to the Delhi LG Anil Baijal on Twitter. After her nephew Vinay Bansal was arrested in the PWD scam , Sunita Kejriwal had hit out on Baijal and asked him to stop ‘harassing’ her widow sister ‘besides the constant harassment of AAP government’ as the former Delhi LG Najeeb Jung is ‘suffering from severe illness and he regretted what he did with AAP government’. She had said that karma never leaves the karta. Within six years of its formation as a political outfit from a bunch of activists, the party appears to have failed to evolve as a responsible political party. That they are no longer activists, and actually answerable to people who elect them and that not everyone who questions or asks them to be accountable are trolls. That people are perhaps questioning them more because as compared to the other political parties in India, AAP came with a promise, a promise of change. That they are going to fight corruption, that they will not play by the rulebook which involved division on caste and religious lines. But they did. AAP has ended up being exactly what they promised they won’t be, sometimes even surpassing the existing political parties in setting a lower bar.",2018-11-26,"Aam Aadmi Party,Arvind Kejriwal,ashutosh,Kumar Vishwas,prashant bhushan,Yogendra yadav",Aam Aadmi Party: Six years and distintegrating,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/aam-aadmi-party-six-years/
50,Abhishek Banerjee,"The secular ecosystem at the time had floated numerous conspiracy theories at the time about the death of ATS Chief Hemant Karkare in the terror attack. In 2013, when farmers were facing a severe drought, then Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar famously offered  to urinate in the dams if people were running out of the water. That has nothing to do with 26/11. It is just an anecdote that characterizes the arrogance and insensitivity of the misrule during the Sonia Gandhi years. Today the secular establishment, humbled in the 2014 election, stands before the Indian people with hands folded, heads bowed and with a tilak on their foreheads. But when the terror attack of 26/11 happened at the height of their power in 2008, we saw a very different, or should we say the real face of both Indian secularism and global liberalism. India is a young country. We must have hundreds of millions of people who were just kids at the time of the attacks in 2008. There’s no better time to tell these stories than today. The attacks began on the night of Nov 26 and continued for nearly 60 hours. Counter-terrorist operations by security forces concluded somewhere around 8 am on Nov 29, which was a Saturday. Our people were mopping up the blood for days afterwards. As the nation mourned, where was “youth icon” Rahul Gandhiji that weekend? He spent  the weekend partying at a farmhouse with friends. They say that the party lasted till 5 am in the morning. Must have been real fun. So what if 166 innocent people have been killed, hundreds of families are in tatters and India’s security and prestige have been torn to shreds? For India’s most powerful people, the party must go on. Please remember that this is the same Rahul Gandhi that media and intellectuals want to pass off as India’s greatest humanitarian. The prince’s party mood after 26/11 stands in sharp contrast to his reaction after India carried out surgical strikes in Sept 2016. That’s when Rahul ji got really angry, blew a fuse and ended up calling PM Modi a “khoon ka dalal”. We know that Rahul Gandhiji went out to party. What was Maharashtra CM Vilasrao Deshmukh doing? Well, on Saturday, Nov 29 morning soon after security forces concluded operations, Vilasrao Deshmukh personally gave a tour of the battered Taj Hotel to his actor son Riteish and Director Ram Gopal Varma. At the time there were murmurs that Ram Gopal Varma was considering making a movie on 26/11. And what could possibly have been more important than that for the Chief Minister of Maharashtra? It’s not like he had something more significant to do at the moment. Some were partying, some were giving tours to Bollywood actors and directors. After all, the show must go on. India’s Communists have never really liked our country and have definitely never been a fan of our security forces. They have always been more likely to be favourable towards the enemy. Whether in the 1962 war or during the long-running Maoist insurgency in several states. But seeing the overwhelming public sympathy for slain NSG commando Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, the martyred son of Kerala, the Communist Chief Minister of the state felt compelled to make a show of visiting the family. But then, some grieving people at the house of Major Unnikrishnan expressed some dislike towards politicians. The arrogant Kerala CM V S Achuthanandan left in a huff, telling the bereaved family that “not even a dog” would have visited their house. Keeping it classy as always. This is exactly what we would expect from Communists. Drunk on power and full of hatred towards India and our valiant troops. In fact, I would have been surprised if they had managed to say anything even slightly more sensitive. Once the Congress leaders had finished attending to more important business, such as attending parties and giving tours to Bollywood actors and directors, did they finally get to the serious stuff? Could they come together and focus the world’s attention to Pakistan’s terrorist activities? Of course not. This is Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh at the release of the book “26/11: An RSS conspiracy?” at the India Islamic Cultural Centre. It wasn’t just this. The secular ecosystem at the time had floated numerous conspiracy theories at the time about the death of ATS Chief Hemant Karkare in the terror attack. They cared about parties, tours for Bollywood folks and spreading rumours about their domestic political opponents. Who had the time to put up a united front against Pakistan? To this day, I shudder to think what would have happened if Ajmal Kasab had not been captured alive. Would the secular ecosystem have fixed the blame for 26/11 attacks on the “Hindu terror”? Amar Balidani Tukaram Omble saved us all many more times than we might realize. Here are three headlines from three major “liberal” global outlets. Notice anything? Not “terrorist” but “gunman”. The global liberal outlets didn’t want to sound too “judgmental” by calling them, terrorists. Even though some of them were trying to murder sick babies in their sleep at the Cama Hospital in Mumbai, which caters to women and children. Still not “terrorists”. That kind of label would be too “judgmental” for Kasab and his friends. They didn’t want to stick a label on Kasab. Not just when he carried out those attacks. Not just when we saw a video of him murdering people. Not even after he was tried and convicted. Try to remember this when one of these outlets like BBC comes calling with a piece of shoddy “research”  that tries to label people as producers of “fake news”  and tries to label nationalism as the “driving force” behind the fake news. There is so much depressing content above that I wanted to end on a note of hope. This is Baby Moshe today. The terrorists tried to snuff out his life when he was just a baby. But in a triumph of human spirit, Baby Moshe survived and he has become a lasting symbol of the bond between India and Israel, two nations suffering the scourge of jihadi terrorism. Live long Baby Moshe. Live long and prosper. When will jihadi terror come to an end? Will it last our whole lifetime? Will it last for the whole lifetime of our children? I have no idea. But let me tell you what legendary Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir is believed to have said. The conflict will come to an end when they love their children more than they hate ours.",2018-11-26,"26/11,Congress,Counter terrorism,Digvijay Singh,Mumbai attacks,Mumbai Terror Attacks,Pakistan,rahul gandhi,RSS",Tales of betrayal and Congress’ insensitivity as the 26/11 terror attack left 166 dead,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/tales-of-betrayal-and-congress-insensitivity-as-the-26-11-terror-attack-left-166-dead/
51,OpIndia Staff,"Last year in a special session of Delhi Assembly, Kejriwal had famously described himself as 'Delhi ke maalik'. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has a penchant for skipping work  and not attending the Assembly  while in session, has called  a special session to discuss the ‘chilli powder attack’ on him. A one-day special session will be held today to discuss the ‘chilli powder attack’ as well as alleged ‘mass deletion’ of names from the voters’ list. The leader of Opposition in the Assembly, BJP’s Vijendra Gupta accused  the government of calling a special session to raise ‘fictitious political issues to bluff the public’. Gupta added that Kejriwal government is raising dust and storm over non-existent issues while it does not deem fit to deliberate over serious issues such as pollution control and providing basic civic amenities. The Congress, which does not  have a single member in the legislative assembly, too, has slammed AAP accusing the party of ‘lowering’ the dignity of the House for holding a ‘special session’ for a ‘trivial issue’ like the chilli powder attack. In a letter to the Speaker of Delhi Assembly, Delhi Pradesh Congress Chief Ajay Maken expressed his disbelief that pressing matters such as increasing pollution in Delhi, law and order situation and dengue epidemic gripping the state is ignored while a personal problem of the chief minister is discussed in special assembly session. Arvind Kejriwal led Delhi government has earlier held special sessions of the Assembly for issues such as demanding  a full statehood and to announce to the world that he is the ‘Delhi ke maalik ‘. It was also during a special session where BJP MLAs were marshalled  out for questioning the government over lack of water supply in the capital. As the party is known to have a penchant for tantrums that can put most toddlers to shame, guessing from the precedent set over past ‘special sessions’, it won’t be surprising if they pass a bill to declare chilli powder as an RSS proposed communal weapon being used by Modiji. The residents of Delhi should be prepared to beg for concessions to use Kashmiri Lal as Tikha Lal has no chances of surviving AAP’s wrath. We are guessing if a new anti-Mirchi bill is passed by the overwhelmingly AAP dominated Delhi assembly, no vehicles will be allowed to hang Nimbu-Mirchi garlands on the front henceforth. Playing the superhit Govinda song ‘Tujhko Mirchi lagi toh main kya karoon’ will be treated as a punishable offence. Households will have to apply for a government permit to use Tadka in their Dals, which can be applied online and will be home delivered after an inspection. Radio Mirchi will be ordered to undergo a name change if they want broadcasting rights in Delhi. It is also notable here that today, when the nation is mourning the 10th anniversary of the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, AAP has deemed it fit to call a special session for so trivial an issue. AAP and its MLAs have been trying to gather an unwarranted level of attention and victimhood after the chilli powder attack. They first tried unsuccessfully to pin the blame on BJP . The MLAs have even called to exclude the Delhi Police personnel from the scheme that awards compensation  to the families of martyrs because of their apparent ‘failure’ to protect their CM.",2018-11-26,"Aam Aadmi Party,ajay maken,Arvind Kejriwal,BJP,Delhi Assembly,Delhi Government","While the nation mourns 26/11, Arvind Kejriwal calls a special session to discuss the mirchi attack on him",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/while-the-nation-mourns-26-11-arvind-kejriwal-calls-a-special-session-to-discuss-the-mirchi-attack-on-him/
52,Jhankar Mohta,"These kinds of untimed statements from senior party members may cause troubles for the Congress party who has been lately trying its best to project its ‘soft-Hindutva’ image. The senior Congress leader, Digvijaya Singh has stoked a fresh controversy  ahead of Madhya Pradesh assembly polls. As per a report in Republic TV, while addressing a public rally in the state, the former MP Chief Minister made some objectionable statements, asserting that he had been receiving a bad name for helping the Muslims and Dalits because they are being constantly threatened from different sections of society. “Congress workers have been dying for 15 years. He has been receiving a bad name, he has been going to jail. He has been dragged into false cases and still, we(BJP) are working in the direction of defeating Congress? They should be ashamed. I am quite sad. I am in deep grief as I am making this speech in front of you. Dalits are being threatened. Muslims are being threatened. Why are you Muslims afraid when your leader Digvijaya Singh is here. I have been infamous for helping Dalits and Muslims,” said Digvijaya Singh during an election rally. The Congress has been busy dialling up  its Hindutva image in Madhya Pradesh before the state assembly elections. Retaliating to these statements former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and BJP leader Uma Bharti attacked the Congress party for always resorting to caste-based politics . “Congress has always been a party that plays the caste card. They have always indulged into communalism. It has divided the country in the name of religion. They have attacked the Sikhs in the name of caste. It is an opportunist party. It is a party that believes in superstitions. It has resulted in the degradation of the country. It has only divided the country in the name of caste and religion,” said Uma Bharti while speaking to reporters in the matter. Recently, a video had surfaced  where party veteran, Kamalnath was caught on camera resolving to use the Muslim card, weeks before the Madhya Pradesh state elections. In a ‘behind-closed-door-meeting’, Kamal Nath was perceived saying that ‘only the Muslim votes can make the Congress party win’. He is the same person who had promised  that a Gaushala will be built at every Panchayat in the state of Madhya Pradesh. These statements coming from a Congress veteran have exposed  the devious intent of the party which has made Soft Hindutva in public, minority appeasement in private and creating caste divide in secret its latest mantra. However, these kinds of untimed statements from senior party members may cause troubled predicaments for the Congress party who has been lately trying its best to project  its ‘soft-Hindutva’ image. Congress’ approach towards wooing voters always seem to be caste or community-based. It has earlier too projected its predisposition towards the minority community. So far so a decade ago the Congress-led UPA government had submitted  before the supreme court that “there was no historical proof of Lord Ram”. Continuing in this context, in December, the Congress party had decided  to maintain ambiguity over its stance on Ram Mandir by refraining from commenting on the matter. The explanation was given then, that it would be unfair to comment on a matter that is sub-judice. Its senior leader Kapil Sibal though was making other noises, with reports  claiming that he was trying to delay the verdict in the matter, by openly trying to push the issue beyond the 2019 elections. Rahul Gandhi furthering the anti-Hindu stance, which his party actually, fundamentally, believes in, had told  the US ambassador that Hindu extremists were a bigger threat to India in the context of the Lashkar-e-taiba. Besides this Hindu terror bogey, was the infamous communal violence bill which the Congress-led UPA government wanted to enact. All this is apart from the noise made by the state level leadership of the Congress, which includes Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah asking for the opinion  of district heads regarding withdrawal of cases lodged against people from the minority community. For a party that has been in power for the major part of India’s independent history, Congress’ tactic of bringing caste, religion, and communities rather than issues of development as their election agenda only exposes its own failure. As the 2019 general elections draw close, the once grand party of India’s politics seems to be fighting a desperate battle.",2018-11-26,"2018 Assembly Elections,BJP,Congress,Digvijay Singh,double standards,Kamalnath,madhya pradesh assembly elections,minority appeasement,Muslim Appeasement,Soft Hindutva",‘Why are you Muslims afraid when Digvijaya Singh is here’? says the veteran Congress leader,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/why-are-you-muslims-afraid-when-digvijaya-singh-is-here-says-the-veteran-congress-leader/

54,Neeraj Ashok,"For the betterment of the 1.3 billion people, let these harsh but beneficial tests continue. Cliché as it may sound, the first step to solving a problem is to see and accept it in its entirety Anyone who voted for Modi in 2014 imagined they are doing it for the betterment of the country. Economic growth was expected to grow multi-fold, the income distribution was to become even between various economic classes, corruption was to come to an end and so on. In a nutshell, all our problems were to come to an end as soon as the lotus lit up on the EVM machines (few non-“rigged” ones included). Many promises have been fulfilled and some, undoubtedly, haven’t. So, will this change depending on which way the elections go in 2019? Will the pace of the country’s growth and quality of common man’s life improve drastically? Unfortunately, no. If a non-BJP coalition government comes to power in 2019 , which would obviously be with the sole agenda to keep Modi away, things will get worse. But that is well-known, so the real question is why will the country not progress faster even if Modi returns in 2019? One recurring thing we have seen since Prime Minister Modi took the reigns in 2014 is while people voted Congress out from direct governance, it is far from eradicating their ideology and more importantly, their influence over institutions. Starting with bureaucrats, they were almost addicted to the free reign they had earlier. Right from their budgets, freebies, even the quid pro quo arrangements with various stakeholders, to them practically running the country. That is until the scams started making headlines at which point they decided to just excuse themselves from any decision-making and hence the virtual standstill in governance which we witnessed for most of UPA 2. Enough has been said and heard about how Prime Minister Modi has tried to change  the ‘chalta hai’ attitude within the bureaucracy of various ministries and how some of them have revolted quietly by ensuring many of the government’s measures do not see light of the day and even when they do, the impact is not as far-reaching as it ideally should have been. Then came the media houses. Never in the country’s history has the blatant bias  of most of the media houses come to the fore as it has since 2014. Even though the game is getting a little more balanced recently, overall the media is still a lot more critical of any shortcoming by anyone related to BJP then they are with their counterparts across the aisle. Most recently, the media was reporting and debating the ‘hate’ politics practiced by UP government by renaming Allahabad. While renaming cities might not be the most logical thing, it is surely not more illogical then it was when Madras was renamed Chennai or Bangalore was renamed Bengaluru. Such was the dishonesty of the Media, that they spoke as if Yogi Adityanath was the first to ever rename a city, forgetting, that most cities were renamed by Congress itself. While the advent of social media has made it difficult for media houses to peddle outright lies, we need to be mindful of the power the news still holds in our country where even today a decent portion of our population is not as tech-savvy to be using social media. The traditional news outlets still shape their views of the country and national politics. So, while one expects the government to take tough decisions  for the betterment of the country, a lot of their time and effort is spent on perception management. Another recurring nuisance we witnessed in the last 4 years was the forced holidays because of strikes, agitations, bandhs, etc. The minorities, be it based on religion, caste or anything at all apparently felt more unsafe in the last 4 years than since 1947. The narrative was so carefully crafted that even some Bollywood celebrities chanted the same tune. While the bandhs and the occasional mob violence might not be new for the country, one chain of incidents exposed a bone-chilling conspiracy and shed light on how Naxalites thrive in the country. The ultra-left wingers disguised as journalists, professors and in other respected professions were exposed to be responsible for hatching the violence which the country suffered in the first two weeks of 2018 starting with Bhima Koregaon violence  in Pune. Supporting the Naxalite movement to weaken the country from within was the main job description of these elites from our society. And while even this might not be an earth-shattering news for some as the red corridor and their urban sympathizers have been infamous for a while now, what was really alarming was the next conspiracy they were working on – to assassinate none other than the alleged poster boy of all the problems and nuisance we have looked at so far, PM Modi. In any democratic country, a plan to assassinate the leader of the government would be nothing short of treason and will be dealt with accordingly by the country’s law enforcement agencies and the courts. But in our country, while the agencies did their job in exposing this conspiracy and arresting the culprits, the courts were unhappy with the idea of these “distinguished” people of the society being in police custody. Thus, they only agreed to keep the individuals within the luxury of their homes in the form of house arrest initially. While for some of them they have now agreed to grant judicial custody, one of them has already walked out free and one other still remains arrested within the luxury of their house. At best, Modi’s tenure can be described as a nationwide diagnostic test since we do not even know the extent to which our institutions have been compromised. And until that is completed, initiating the correct treatment is a far-fetched dream. Make no mistake, this effort has not been limited to just some non-invasive minor scans and cuts but includes a major shot of radiation/chemotherapy in the form of demonetization. And what did that show us? The backbone of our economy, the banks (some of their employees) were working against the country’s immune system by helping the culprits launder their illicit wealth and camouflage them as healthy cells. Another pillar of democracy which has raised eyebrows over its conduct during Modi’s tenure is, unfortunately, the judiciary. It all started with the efforts of the Modi government in its very first year to bring in transparency in the process of appointment and promotion of judges, which despite being cleared in both the houses of Parliament was shot down  by the Supreme Court. Apparently, they did not see any issue with the opaque method of the collegium. This led to the initiation of the tug of war between the government and the court over the appointment of various judges in the last 4 years. Congress also attempt to impeach  the CJI. This brazen attempt was shot down by the Vice President, and rightly so. Irrespective of how objectively one tries to look at this, two issues stand out. Firstly, the fact that the trust in the Judiciary  is certainly wavering especially after some of the decisions  that concerned Hindu tradition Sabarimala decision, Ayodhya postponement and the Diwali cracker verdict to name the most prominent ones. Secondly, and probably more appalling thing is the statement from the CJI stating there are more important matters for the Supreme Court to look at other than Ayodhya. And if anyone is wondering what can be more important than an issue which has been lingering for more than a century, is associated with the religious beliefs of close to a billion people and has led to riots in the past, the very next day the SC dwelled into the pricing of the Rafale jets . Something which just a week earlier they had said they won’t get into. If one is looking for any common links between the two issues, look no further than the ultimate beneficiary in both these instances – Congress. Such instances make Harish Salve’s video from 2014 seem prophetic wherein he warned of situations where Congress would use the judiciary  to intervene in the governance. And while none of this might really be happening for the first time, what is really worrying is the possible intention and the final outcome of these moves. The government and the billion people, it seems are being told in virtually no uncertain terms to look for a different solution if a temple is to be constructed in its rightful place. Already the demand for an ordinance in this regard was being made as many felt the solution to this historic issue needs to be found outside the court, such voices have only got louder since the CJI’s 5-minute-long hearing. Now, if the government goes down the ordinance route, it risks creating a political storm. On the other hand, if they don’t bring an ordinance and wait for the Supreme Court which is now all but certain to not happen before the 2019 elections, they risk alienation from RSS and other supporters, allies and some part of the Hindu voter base. What this has essentially done is create a state of conflict where there ideally should have been none. This has been the Congress’ modus operandi all along. Create conflict where there should be none through beneficiaries it has inoculated for decades. Congress is a disruptive force which is more lethal when out of power than when in power. While all of this will unfold in the next few months before the 2019 elections, it leads us to one logical conclusion for now, irrespective of what and how hard the government tries, the influence and ideology inculcated by the Congress rule since independence will not allow India to realize its true potential. However, it took a Modi and his diagnostic tests for us to even just realize this, and as mentioned before, even now we are probably unaware of the extent to which our institutions are compromised. Thus, for the betterment of the 1.3 billion people, let these harsh but beneficial tests continue.

55,OpIndia Staff,"Congress leaders were involved in mass sexual exploitation of girls in Ajmer As a part of campaigning for assembly elections in Rajasthan, Congress president Rahul Gandhi visited and offered prayers at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah today. He was accompanied by Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot and former chief minister Ashok Gehlot. After that, he addressed a rally in Pokhran. As the Congress leaders visited the shrine, its dark past where Congress leaders were also associated, comes to mind. One recalls the mass rape and sexual exploitation that had happened  at Ajmer which was exposed in 1992. Several members of the ‘Khadim’ family, who are the traditional caretakers of the Dargah, were involved in the crime. The modus operandi of this crime was similar to what the Muslim grooming gangs  have been doing in the UK in recent times. They would trap one girl and manage to take obscene images. Then they would blackmail the girl into familiarising them to her classmates and friends. Eventually, other girls would be raped, sexually exploited and have their pictures taken. The cycle continued so forth. The gang continued to expand its operations and victimise an increasing number of girls. Local police were aware of this organised crime, but they turned a blind eye because the Khadims were powerful people with connections in high places. Even after a local newspaper exposed the crime, the prosecution was difficult as not many girls were ready to come forward and testify. One of the main accused  in the case was Farooq Chishty, president of Ajmer Congress. Other two persons accused in the case were vice-president and joint secretary of the city Congress unit. Initially, Farooq escaped prosecution by claiming to be mentally unstable. The defence was successful in proving that he had developed schizophrenia. He was convicted much later in 2007 by a fast track court. It was estimated that more 500 girls became victims of this gang, most of them Hindus, while the criminals were Muslims. Rapists were not the only people to have exploited the helpless girls, others also joined in harassing them. Many local papers and tabloids had got photographs clicked by rapists, and they used those photos to extort money from the girls by blackmailing them. Pokhran is the place where India has conducted its nuclear tests. And while Rahul Gandhi visits the place to campaign for election, the stand of the Congress party on the tests can’t be ignored. While the first nuclear test was done at the same location by Indira Gandhi government in 1974, Congress reaction to the second test by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1998 was dubious. While the tests were vital in building India’s nuclear weapons, the Congress party had actually opposed  the tests. Then Congress president Sonia Gandhi had said that “real strength lies in restraint, not in the display of shakti,” referring to Operation Shakti, the name given to the operation. Party spokesperson Salman Khurshid said that BJP had done the test for political reasons and not to enhance the security of the nation. India’s neighbouring enemies have nuclear weapons, despite that fact, the Congress party had opposed the nuclear tests.",2018-11-26,"2018 Assembly Elections,Ajmer dargah,Ajmer Sharif,rahul gandhi,rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election","As Rahul Gandhi prays at Ajmer Dargah before talking in Pokhran, here is Congress’ tarnished history with both places",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/as-rahul-gandhi-prays-at-ajmer-dargah-before-talking-in-pokhran-here-is-congress-tarnished-history-with-both-places/
56,OpIndia Staff,"The UP deputy CM also said that until the matter is in court, date of temple construction can't be specified Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Keshav Prasad Maurya today denied  the role of Shiva Sena in the Ram Temple Movement. The statement of Maurya comes a day after Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray along with scores of Shiv sainiks reached  Ayodhya to build pressure on the BJP to pass an ordinance for the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. “There is no problem in Uddhav Thackeray catching a glimpse of Ram Lalla… But, had Balasaheb Thackeray been alive, he would have prevented Uddhav from doing whatever he is doing,” Maurya remarked. “The Shiv Sena had no role in the temple movement or even in the Dharam Sabha, though Balasaheb Thackeray would support the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP),” he added. The Deputy Chief Minister, who was part of the VHP during the Ram Mandir movement, suggested that Uddhav Thackeray should take the Vishva Hindu Parishad along with his party instead of creating a divide. Another BJP MLA Surender Singh also criticised the Shiv Sena for hijacking the Ram Temple issue. Maurya also attacked Akhilesh Yadav who had asked for the deployment of Army in Ayodhya for the Dharm Sabha of the VHP and termed the remarks as Samajwadi party’s frustration. “If Akhilesh Yadav is thinking that a 1990-like situation will prevail, then this will not happen under the government headed by Yogi Adityanath. We will provide adequate security to all and take necessary action. This is a Dharam Sabha, and there is no need to deploy the Army, and Akhilesh Yadav must understand this,” he said .

For the BJP, Ram temple has never been an election issue, but has been a matter of faith and devotion. There is no point in deriving any electoral mileage from this issue”. When asked about giving a date of the Ram Mandir construction, he replied, “Till the time the matter is pending in the Supreme Court, neither the BJP nor other organisations associated with the temple movement can tell the dates.

57,OpIndia Staff,"It is interesting to note that the Congress' minority appeasement politics did not escape the eyes of even the U.S. ambassador to India. A leaked WikiLeaks document  reveals how the Congress party played politics over the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. It did not escape the notice of even the then U.S. ambassador to India, David Mulford. In the leaked memo, Mulford is seen talking about the Congress party’s politics over the 26/11 Mumbai tragedy. He mentions that P. Chidambaram officially denied any Hindutva link to the terror attacks after the UPA Minority Affairs Minister made outrageous claims. Antulay had claimed that Hindutva element was behind the death of Hemant Karkare. Antulay said ,  “Superficially speaking, they (terrorists) had no reason to kill Karkare. Whether he (Karkare) was a victim of terrorism or terrorism plus something I do not know.” “Karkare found that there are non-Muslims involved in acts of terrorism in some cases. Any person going to the roots of terrorism has always been the target,” Antulay had said, adding: “There is more than what meets the eye.” Soon after the initial denial of Antulay’s rhetoric, the party issued statements which “implicitly endorsed” the conspiracy theories, Mulford observed. “The Congress party, after first distancing itself from the comments (of Antulay, the then Minority Affairs Minister), two days later issued a contradictory statement which implicitly endorsed the conspiracy. During this time, Mr Antulay’s completely unsubstantiated claims gained support in the conspiracy-minded Indian—Muslim community,” Mulford wrote in his secret cable to the State Department on December 23, 2008. “Hoping to foster that support for upcoming national elections, the Congress Party cynically pulled back from its original dismissal and lent credence to the conspiracy,” he added. Mulford also observed that the Congress party chose to engage in dangerous identity politics for electoral benefits. He wrote, “The party chose to pander to Muslims’ fears, providing the impetus for those in the Muslim community who will continue to play up the conspiracy theory. While cooler heads eventually prevailed within the Congress leadership, It is interesting to note that the Congress’ minority appeasement politics did not escape the eyes of even the U.S. ambassador to India.

59,K Bhattacharjee,"Congress seems to be sacrificing national interest at the altar of petty politics by playing the game by the rules set by international players who would rather see India bend. While it might serve his politics, this misplaced political evangelism certainly doesn't serve the interests of the country.  In an earlier report,  we have elaborated on the controversial past of Sherpa, the NGO that has filed a complaint against the Rafale Deal  in France. The NGO and its head, William Bourdon, have been accused of meddling in the internal affairs of countries in Africa and filing corruption charges against the Mauritian President while being closely associated with the latter’s political opponent. Three relatives of the President are set to file a defamation suit against the NGO. A corporate giant, too, intends to file a defamation suit against them for the allegations they have levelled. Therefore, we decided to dig a little deeper into the NGO Sherpa’s background. We discovered that they are partners  with organizations such as Greenpeace, Open Society Foundation, Misereor, Oxfam, ActionAid among a host of others. All of these have been involved in a myriad of controversies in which we shall now delve into. As we have said in an earlier report , Misereor is a Christian organization that was one of the principal donors of Equations, the organization that published a report  demonizing the Amarnath Yatra in collaboration with a Kashmiri separatist organization. Misereor funds various Christian missionary organizations in India as well. George Soros’ Open Society Institute’s controversies  are quite well known. The nationalist government of Hungary that strongly opposes the influx of refugees into the European Union has been at war with George Soros for quite a while. Last year, the Hungarian government made it mandatory  for NGOs that received funding from abroad to register with the state, a move that was seen to be targeted towards Soros which did not go down well with the European Union. The Hungarian also passed  a legislation titled ‘Stop Soros’ in a crackdown on illegal immigration. In December 2015, Russia banned  two foundations funded by the progressive Jewish-American philanthropist George Soros, claiming they posed a “threat to national security” and were undermining the Russian constitution. In India as well, George Soros’ organization funds the Socio-Legal Information Center whose division Human Rights Law Network is involved in a campaign to abolish  sedition laws in India. The accomplishments of Oxfam have been well documented by us at OpIndia. One of the board members of Oxfam India, Gagan Sethi, was one of the members of the NAC that drafted  the wildly anti-Hindu Communal Violence Bill. Oxfam has also been involved  in a cover-up of sexual exploitation by its members in Haiti including the then country-director Ronald van Hauwermeiren. Oxfam is known to publish  absurd conclusions based on studies that employ questionable methodologies. Therefore, we have an NGO with a dubious reputation which is partners with other organizations with an extremely controversial past and have been known to meddle with the internal affairs of countries. Especially, Sherpa itself has been accused of meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore, the complaint filed by Sherpa against the Rafale deal should be treated with extreme caution. The Rafale deal  is, by all means, a deal of national importance for India. Congress is perhaps simply using dubious sources to further its own agenda of drumming up hysteria without realising that the elements who are opposing such steps of the Modi government today have always had an agenda which goes against the interests of the nation. Congress seems to be sacrificing national interest at the altar of petty politics by playing the game by the rules set by international players who would rather see India bend.

While BJP had the first movers advantage as far as using social media as an effective tool for political messages is concerned, Congress didn’t take too long to realise that they had to up their game. However, instead of using the platform to connect with its supporters, Congress has often misused this platform to spread ‘fake news’ and false narratives to malign the Bharatiya Janata Party, a party that has, by all standards become the political antidote to Congress. Congress’ “reinvigorated” social media presence, and Rahul Gandhi’s “coming of age” on social media, have been under scrutiny lately. From campaigns  which have backfired, frequent  goof ups, to Rahul using bots as virtual steroids  to boost his social media influence, we have seen it all. Congress and its coterie have on several occasions spread fake news and fabricated stories and often been caught in the act. Congress has developed a penchant to hold BJP responsible for anything and everything happening under the deep blue sky. Be it from lying over  LPG gas prices, or about Japan withdrawing  funding for bullet trains, Congress has not left any stone unturned. Rahul Gandhi led Congress has been random and sans merit in conjuring up scams by this government and BJP functionaries which have been summarily debunked. In their desperation, they did not even spare Amit Shah, the BJP president, and this time the accusations  are even more ludicrous and weak than before. Shekhar Gupta and his left- propaganda website, The Print, has almost played  a pivotal role, helping the so-called ‘liberal cabal’ to bolster the ‘Nehru-Gandhi dynasty’ crusade. Yet another leftist propaganda website, The Wire has been working hands in gloves with the Congress, helping them to conduct such hollow hitjobs. He had earlier shared The Wire’s comprehensively debunked hit job  on Piyush Goyal with some caustic comments without realising his self-goal perhaps . He is no stranger to self-goals too. In fact, not so long ago he had done exactly the same when we at OpIndia has preemptively busted an imminent hitjob against the Finance Minister , Arun Jaitley. After our article, ‘The Wire’ had conceded that “there was not much of a story to pursue after all” , which is why they had dropped the story after receiving a response from Jaitley and his daughter’s firm. Mr Rahul Gandhi had then proceeded to plug the very article where ‘The Wire’ had admitted to no impropriety on the part of Arun Jaitley, in a bid to tarnish his image. We had then also speculated whether Rahul Gandhi actually knew of the imminent hitjob . In their article, the Congress also mentions the Jay Shah hitjob which was debunked by us comprehensively  and the portal responsible for that hitjob is facing a 100 crore defamation suit, in which the court has already mentioned that a prima facie  case exists against the portal. Congress loyalists, in an attempt to belittle PM Modi, has gone to extreme lengths from spreading  sensational conspiracies, like the one involving Nirav Modi and the Income Tax department to sharing  fake news from an Islamist website to attack the Modi government. On the anniversary of demonetization, Congress launched  a barrage of data from its social media handle, to claim demonetization was a failure. The Congress party and its allies have been going hammer and tongs against the Modi led government alleging a scam  in the purchase of Dassault Rafale jets  despite several experts explaining  threadbare why no scam exists.  In its desperation to prove its point the Congress social media head, Divya Spandan and lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan kept the ball rolling by furthering  this lie on Twitter. In fact, in their rashness to do so, they even resorted  to a dubious website ‘IndiaScoops’, which is nothing but a scurvy propaganda site. Be it political or personal, Congress and its long journalist brigade have mastered the art of storytelling. Not very long back a video , emphasising on the importance of including Yoga in daily life released by PM Modi, had left the left-wing propagandists fluttering in their pants. They laboriously built up a false narrative using an article published by the same dubious website, ‘Indiascoops’, proofing  it yet again that deep inside, these ‘journalists’ and politicians are just rumour mongering trolls. These few incidents are just a lean example giving us a sneak peek into this artfully constructed web which the Congress and its machinery have practised over the years. As we move towards the 2019 general elections, the method of operation adopted by the Congress is almost identical to that of 2004. While many of us try to dissect these half-baked theories, a Twitter user who goes by the handle ‘@im_saiganesh’, gave us a reminder lesson on how Congress and its ecosystem used a similar method in 2004 to spread canards against Vajpayee led BJP. Following are a few examples: The ‘liberal’ cabal and their entire ecosystem not only has a habit to peddle fake news but also to indulge in misrepresenting facts, trying to belittle the good things the BJP government has been doing now and even then. Saiganesh further presented facts showcasing this typical tendency of the leftist media trying to detract the BJP government. In the current scenario, the way PM Modi’s ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna’ was called out  as being a scam by Congress veteran leader P Chidambaram, who himself is under the scanner for his involvement in various scams , Vajpayee was then targeted  for his proposal to expand the metro. During the Vajpayee era, fake ecosystem  told that Kargil war is for politics. Now during Modi era, they say surgical strikes is for politics. This bogus tactical plan to blame and shame BJP has become a penchant with the Congress and the Lutyen media. In their desperation to regain power, Congress has crossed the line of virtue on innumerable occasions. As the country heads towards the 2019 general elections it would be interesting to see to what level the entire Congress ecosystem would stoop to.",2018-11-24,"Amit Shah,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,BJP,Congress lies,Congress scams,congress social media,fake news,IndiaScoops,Lefti Liberals,leftist propaganda,liberal cabals,PM Narendra Modi,rafael deal,Rahul Gandhi lies",One trick pony: Rahul Gandhi led Congress spreads canards now just like the party did in 2004,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/one-trick-pony-rahul-gandhi-led-congress-spreads-canards-now-just-like-the-party-did-in-2004/

He said, “Sarbandana Sonowal has made this rule, he has not married, he is single, he does not have love for small children, he does not understand what is love for small kids”. After that, he added, “even Modi does not understand it. Because although Modi had married, six months after the marriage he had chased away his wife from his house. For the last 45 years, he is leading a life of a bachelor. Modi is single, how will he know the value of children in family”. Bora added, “government should supply water, they should build roads. But instead of doing these the government is going house to house counting children”. Then he dragged Ramdev into the debate, saying, “Sonowal follows Modi, and Modi follows Baba Ramdev, and that Ramdev is also a bachelor. Nobody is married, they don’t value the love of children”.

Arvind Kejriwal, the controversial Chief Minister of Delhi, who is often known to change his views in a short span of time has once again taken a similar U-turn. Kejriwal has now referred the Delhi police as his ‘family’ and claimed that he respect men in uniform, reported  ANI.

He further said that there may be some officers who are politically motivated, but that doesn’t mean that the Delhi Police is bad.

Amarinder Singh said that due to continued terrorist attacks in Punjab, killings of Indian soldiers by armed forces of Pakistan, he will not be attending the event. He said, “not a day passes when Indian soldiers are not killed or wounded on the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir,” adding that “rather than moving towards normalcy these incidents are escalating.” The Punjab chief minister also accused ISI of starting its “nefarious activities within Punjab.” He wrote  to Pakistan Foreign Minister, “I hope the Prime Minister will understand that under these circumstances it will not be possible for me to be present in Pakistan on this historic occasion, despite the fact that paying my respects at Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib has always been my cherished dream which will hopefully be fulfilled once these hostilities and killings are stopped.” Punjab minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu also has been invited by the Pakistan Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and Sidhu had happily accepted the invitation.

67,Rahul Roushan,"In past couple of days, there is a synchronized narrative going on where the question  ‘why does BJP fear Lalu so much?’ is being tossed around to make sure the hypothesis ‘BJP fears Lalu’ becomes an implied truth. Motley of journalists and trolls are repeating this, in an attempt to not only turn that hypothesis into truth, but to generate sympathy for Lalu Yadav, currently in hospital but under custody after being convicted in various corruption cases. This sympathy for Lalu was tried right at the time he was convicted in the corruption cases, with Shekhar Gupta, the senior journalist of ‘coup’ fame, peddling the theory that Lalu was convicted because he belonged to a ‘lower caste’. Obviously, within no time, his theory came crashing down  as the list of those convicted along with Lalu had many ‘upper caste’ accused too. But when has facts and data mattered for ‘liberals’? This desperation to paint Lalu Yadav some saint who was wronged actually begets the real question – why do the self-declared liberals love Lalu so much? The answer could appear simple. The ‘liberal’ crowd in India is basically a confused anti-BJP crowd, with most of them being anti-BJP because it’s not just ‘cool’ but rewarding to take an anti-BJP stand (or anti-Hindutva) in public life. Unfunny comedians become intellectuals while genocidal maniacs become artists , so a corrupt politician becoming a wronged saint is hardly surprising. Why does this crowd hates BJP or Hindutva is another issue, and well, I have to concede that BJP as well as Hindutva groups have to share some blame for it, though the main reason is relentless vilification for decades by a well-oiled propaganda machinery. However, Lalu is anti-BJP not due to some ideological commitment, but because of realpolitik. Just think of it; isn’t it rather strange that this cool liberal crowd doesn’t feel the same sympathy and loyalty for Mulayam Singh Yadav, who got dozens of (unofficial accounts putting the numbers in hundreds) Kar Sevaks killed to save the Babri Masjid (Taj Mahal of secularism) and who let go his ego to ally with Mayawati to end the BJP rule and influence in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest state of India that often decides balance of power? As compared to killing of Kar Sevaks, Lalu just got Advani arrested during the veteran BJP leader’s Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 – a ‘secular’ guy should give more numbers for the former act. Further, Lalu’s ego didn’t stop him from breaking Janta Dal, which was becoming a national force to reckon with. Lalu breaking Janta Dal and alienating the likes of Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan actually strengthened the BJP while Mulayam did everything to weaken the BJP in the neighbouring state. At one point of time, BJP was appearing weaker than an already hopeless Congress in Uttar Pradesh, before the 2014 miracle happened. Today, Mulayam Singh Yadav is isolated, is as much ‘victim’ of politics as Lalu, and is reportedly in bad health as well like Lalu, but the cool liberal dude doesn’t care about him. Because he suspects that Mulayam Singh Yadav (or his faction supposed to be led by Shivpal Yadav) may even align with the BJP. Netaji is unpredictable. On the other hand, Lalu and his family is considered pure and steadfast on this count. They will never align with the BJP. But as I put earlier, Lalu is anti-BJP not due to some ideological commitment, but because of realpolitik. Nitish Kumar could never really become a mass leader like Lalu and his charisma was limited to some selected circles – his own caste group and some allied groups, the urban crowd (thanks to improvement in law and order and some development), women (yes, he could create a new constituency), and in some Lutyens circles. Even Nitish Kumar realised his limitations, and that’s why he didn’t risk a three-cornered fight in the 2015 assembly elections. Had he become as powerful as charismatic in Bihar as Lalu, and had Bihar too got three or four major political players with distinct messaging and supporting social groups as one sees in Uttar Pradesh, you never know that maybe Lalu and BJP could have been forming an alliance too or at least flirting with each other. Therefore, to present Lalu as some committed soldier of secularism is as dishonest as anything the ‘liberal’ crowd does. However, beyond this anti-BJP/anti-Hindutva ‘commitment’ of Lalu, the reason why the self-declared liberals love Lalu so much is because consciously or accidentally, Lalu has been able to replicate the way Gandhi family functions. If you observe, the liberal love for Lalu is no different from the love they have for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. They try to make sure that the crimes by both are covered and the culprits are actually paraded as martyrs. As I had pointed briefly in an earlier article I wrote , Shabnam Hashmi, whose brother Safdar Hashmi – a communist playwright and theatre personality – was killed by Congress backed goons in broad daylight, but today she bats religiously for Congress even by spreading  fake news to benefit the party. Similarly, Kanhaiya Kumar, a JNU student ‘leader’ who has been giving hopes to some liberals as the next big thing, touches Lalu Yadav’s feet. The same Yadav, whose party goons killed Chandrashekhar Prasad, who was also a JNU student leader, in broad daylight. The ‘Jungle Raj’ of Lalu is given context of social revolution and social churn, just as some try to give context to Emergency and paint how it was not so bad, or more recently, the way scam tainted regime of UPA-2 is being whitewashed. The ecosystem appears almost full of guilt and desperate to undo the damage in both cases –  How could Lalu secure this support of ecosystem? With Congress, it was due to Indira Gandhi, who could work out a Faustian bargain with the leftists in the 70s, allowing them to control academia and media. In return, these ‘intellectuals’ made sure that the dynasty was always protected. They would pretend to fight with Congress, but make sure the dynasty is not blemished. Lalu too, in his later years, tried to please the same ecosystem. His ‘so-cute’ selfies with Lutyens journalists and his support to ideas that will have no resonance among his social base but will earn him brownie points among the ecosystem, bear testimony to that. And obviously, becoming an ally of the original dynasty came with the associated benefits. Coincidentally, both the dynasties are now led by ‘youth’ leaders who are goofy and are often object of mockery. But the ‘liberals’ have no option but to love them. Essentially, it’s the self-interest of the ‘liberals’ – to see those people calling shots who have fed them well all these years – that makes them love the ‘secularism’ of Lalu Yadav. And finally, this orchestrated attempt to paint Lalu as someone mighty whom the BJP fears no end, is actually manifestation of the fears of the ‘liberal’ crowd. They fear the BJP and they are now giving up on their hopes with new Lalus they created and flirted with – from Arvind Kejriwal to Kanhaiya Kumar.

71,OpIndia Staff,"Madhya Pradesh Congress has been in news because of infighting between leaders like Kamal Nath, Digvijaya Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia.  Many Twitter users today were tweeting with ‘#NaamBadloMaharaj ‘ hashtag and we got a little curious. Believing that Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who in popular parlance referred to as ‘Yuvraj’ has been elevated to Maharaj, we clicked on the tag. The top tweet was from BJP Madhya Pradesh official account. The video contained a clip from NDTV where the reporter is asking Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia’s comment on Kamal Nath’s communal statement. As per video that has gone viral on social media, Kamal Nath, while addressing a gathering had said that it will be a big loss to Congress if 90% of Muslims don’t vote for Congress . Scindia had refuted the claims that Kamal Nath would have never said such a thing. “If Kamal Nath ji has said this, that if 90% Muslims don’t vote for us, it will be a big loss to us, I am ready to change my name,” Scindia could be heard saying. He refused to believe that Kamal Nath had said the above words. In the video shared by BJP Madhya Pradesh, from 00:37 onward, Kamal Nath could be heard saying the exact thing. This is why twitterati wants Scindia to keep his promise and change his name. #NaamBadloMaharaj was a dig at his royalty roots since he is the grandson of Jivajirao Scindia, the last Maharaja of the princely state of Gwalior and son of Madhavrao Scindia, the last titular Maharaja of Gwalior. Amusingly, this is not the first time Scindia has been caught brimming with overconfidence. In 2015 interview after the Delhi Assembly elections, Scindia was speaking about how Rahul Gandhi has brought about a change. India TV’s Rajat Sharma pointed out how the then Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was caught  on camera copying the condolence message at the Nepal embassy when he went to express solidarity with the earthquake victims. In the above video, from 02:47 onward, Scindia says Rahul Gandhi is ready to bring about a change. When Sharma points out that he was copying the condolence message, Scindia brazens it out and asks for proof. He then claims how the media misinterprets things. Sharma, then shows him the clip. Despite the fact that Rahul Gandhi is seen touching his mobile phone screen so that it doesn’t get locked and he could copy the message easily, Scindia stood his ground.

The NGO was immediately hailed as an ‘anti-corruption’ crusader, which may as well be. However, William Bourdon hasn’t been an alien to his share of controversies in the past. Sherpa, headed by William Bourdon has been accused in the past of meddling in the affairs of African countries to get media coverage and funds in exchange. A detailed report  was published in International Policy Digest that detailed his exploits in Africa and termed him as a media hungry person. Reportedly, Bourdon was closely associated with Mohamad Ould Boumataou when he filed corruption charges against the Mauritian President, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, Bouamatou’s cousin and political opponent. Sherpa was also entirely funded by an organization both Bourdon and Bouamtou were board members of in 2015 and 2016. Three relatives of the Mauritian President are set to file a defamation suit  against the lawyer-businessman. Sherpa has also been involved in a number of failed corporate lawsuits. The NGO filed human rights charges against corporate giants like Samsung Electronics and Vinci Construction Company. The latter vigorously denied the allegations that it violated the rights of migrant workers in Qatar helping build the football stadiums for the 2022 World Cup and initiate defamation  proceedings against the NGO.

73,OpIndia Staff,"The report says the death squad of the LeT has penetrated into the Lutyen's zone and has been monitoring the movements of the PM. News channel Times Now has claimed  that they have accessed an intelligence report which says that the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba has been monitoring movements of PM Modi and the PM is being treated as the number 1 target of the dreaded terrorist group. The report claims that the channel has accessed an internal security note by the Intelligence Bureau which claims that a sleeper cell of the dreaded terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba has penetrated into Delhi’s Lutyens area where all the offices and residences of the ministers and top bureaucrats are located. The report claims that Lashkar has formed death squads and has been tracking the movements of PM Modi in and around the area. The document also reportedly says that the Lashkar sleeper cell has reconnoitred the route from 7, Lok Kalyan Marg (the PM’s residence) to his office in the South Block. It also says that the death squad has received orders from their commander Hafiz Saeed to assassinate PM Modi. The report goes ahead to state that before the 26/11 attacks, David Coleman Headly was given the exact same task of monitoring the important buildings and routes in specific locations. The report further states that the intelligence agencies have received several clues and important pieces of information over the last few months and the security around the Raisina Hill area has been tightened significantly. In the last few days, the security agencies have completely blocked off public access to the offices of ministers in the North and South blocks. Though there were displeasures and questions regarding the sudden change in security arrangements, Times Now claims that it is because of the recent information that the LeT has reconnoitred the PM’s travel route from his official residence to PMO. The report also claims that additional security cordons and outposts can now be seen on the route and also around the PM’s residence and office. In the past too, there have been numerous instances of terrorist attack threat to the PM’s life. In December 2015, a major plot to attack the PM  by LeT was foiled when the security agencies arrested the terrorists who had infiltrated into the Indian border through the LoC. In July this year too, there was a high alert  issued to intelligence agencies over a possible LeT plot to target the PM and the parliament.

74,Raju Das,"As per BARC data, BJP is not even in the top ten advertisers for the week ending November 16. On 23rd November, Economic Times ran a story  titled  The story said that BJP was ahead of other advertisers like Hindustan Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Amazon and others. The story mentions that BJP ranked as number one advertiser across all channels, up from number two in the previous week. The story was soon followed by other media  houses and all of them published  the same story. It soon became viral on Social Media, and leaders from opposition parties were quick to spread the same. As per some reports, the Congress party went ahead and demanded a probe by the Election Commission into BJP becoming ‘top advertiser’. The claim that BJP has surpassed traditional advertisers like HUL was a surprising news, so we decided to check the source of the news. The weekly television advertising and viewership data are uploaded on the BARC website , so we headed there to verify the report. When we selected to see the top 10 advertisers for the week ended November 16, we were presented with the following table. As you can see, forget being the number 1 advertiser for the week, BJP is not even in the top 10 list. As per the BARC data, Hindustan Lever Ltd (they are still using the old name for the company) is the top advertiser for the week ending November 16. HUL is followed by Reckitt Benckiser, ITC, Procter & Gamble, Ponds India, Wipro, Cadburys, Brook Bond Lipton, Godrej Consumer Products and Marico in the list of ten, all predictable top advertisers on television, with BJP nowhere to be seen. From the BARC website, it is clear that  But why a media house like Economic Times publish such a baseless news? On the BARC website, there is one more category for advertises on television, top 10 brands. And on that list, BJP is occupying the top place for the same week, followed by Netflix and Trivago. So, BJP is the top advertised brand on TV for the week, but it was not the top advertiser as media reports claiming. If companies like HUL are in top advertiser list, why they don’t feature in the top brand list, you may ask. The answer is simple, FMCG behemoths like HUL, ITC etc have dozens of products for which they advertise on TV. This means, although they spend the highest amount on advertisements, that amount is divided among various brands. For that simple reason, BJP has emerged as the top advertised brand as the party’s advertising is not divided among numerous brands like consumer goods companies. That is also the reason why Netflix and Trivago are on the list because these companies do not have multiple brands to divide their advertising. There is a fundamental difference between becoming a top advertiser and top advertised brand. And to claim one as the another is definitely a fake news. The BARC data is publicly available online, even then how and why the media houses spread this fake news, that is a big question. One media house may have done a mistake, but it can’t be believed other media houses covering the story didn’t check the source website even once. This must be a deliberate attempt at spreading misinformation regarding BJP ahead of elections. On this issue, Congress is perhaps right, Election Commission should inquire into the matter to find out the root of this fake news.",2018-11-23,"advertisements,Anti BJP,BJP,economic times,fact check,fake news,media lies,Media Lies List",Media peddles fake news about BJP becoming the top advertiser on television,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/media-peddles-fake-news-about-bjp-becoming-the-top-advertiser-on-television/
75,OpIndia Staff,"Congress maliciously compared subsidized prices during the Congress era to non-subsidized prices now. Congress seems to have run out of innovative poll strategies and like the quintessential one trick pony, it has resorted to blatant lying over and over again. This time, Congress took to Twitter to lie about LPG prices under the Congress regime and those under the Modi regime. After taking a juvenile dig saying Prime Minister Modi uses “Mitrogen” gas for cooking, Congress’ official handle on Twitter goes on to say LPG is selling at exorbitant prices, Rs. 1000 in some states. It then plugs a graphic that shows during Congress, LPG was being sold at Rs. 344.75 and now, the same gas cylinder is being sold for Rs. 942. Congress, rather craftily, misleads its voters thoroughly. LPG cylinders are sold at two different rates across the country. One, which is the subsidized rate, the other, is the non-subsidized rate where people have started giving up their subsidies voluntarily since the Prime Minister had urged people to do so. Congress has conflated the two to further their rhetoric. Following are the prices of non-subdized LPG cylinders across the four metropolitan cities as on November 7th 2018. It must be borne in mind that if someone avails the option of buying subsidized LPG cylinders, the difference of price between that and the non-subsidized cylinder is paid by the government. From the prices mentioned, it is evident that Congress is quoting the price of non-subsidized LPG cylinders. The Congress quoted the price as being Rs. 942, and on the Indane Gas website, as on 7th November 2018, the price of non-subsidized LPG cylinders in Delhi was Rs. 942.50. Now, if one goes by the graphic shared by Congress, one is to assume that the price of non-subsidised LPG cylinders in Delhi during the Congress regime was Rs. 344.75. This is however far from the truth. In December 2013, when the Congress government was in power, to May 2014, when the Congress’ regime ended, the price of LPG, the prices were well within the same range. In fact, it touched a record of Rs. 1241 in January 2014. It is thus evident that Congress was not comparing non-subsidised LPG prices during its own regime and Modi regime. The only logical explanation is that Congress maliciously compared subsidized prices during the Congress era to non-subsidized prices now. The prices of subsidized LPG’s as on 7th November 2018 were as following Since Congress took the non-subsidized price of Rs. 942 of Delhi, the subsidized price of LPG in Delhi as on 7th November 2018 is 507.42. Now, is this price astronomically higher than what it used to be during the Congress regime? If we look at more or less the same period in 2013, the prices of subsidized LPG in Delhi,  Interestingly, in the entire chart of subsidized LPG prices, right from January 2004 to today, we couldn’t find a single figure of Rs. 344.75 that has been quoted by the Congress. In fact, if one looks at the increase in prices of subsidized LPG cylinders, one realises that the increase in 10 years of Congress government and that of 4.5 years of Modi government are poles apart. The prices, in Mumbai for example increased by 66.4% during 10 years of Congress and has increased by 11.5% in 4.5 years of the Modi government. Here is how the price of subsidized cylinder grew when the Congress government was in power. Whereas, since the BJP has come to power, the increase in prices has halted substantially. Following is the chart for BJP. It is thus evident that Congress was wrong on several counts. Perhaps Congress would do well to get their information straight before making a mockery out of themselves by spreading lies that are so easily caught.",2018-11-24,"Congress,Congress lies,fact check,fake news,LPG,modi government,Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Subsidies,UPA","Congress lies yet again, this time about prices of LPG cylinders",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/rahul-gandhi-lies-fake-news-price-lpg-cylinder-during-congress-and-modi-government/

77,Nupur J Sharma,"If one bothers to look beyond the headline that almost reads like it has been written it caps with several exclamation points and prefixed with ""SHOCKING"", one realises the pointlessness and perhaps the viciousness of the story. There are certain cases which are eternal political gimmicks. Before every election, like clockwork, some new PIL will be filed or some “explosive” statement will be made that will be splashed all over “friendly” media so Congress can take potshots at BJP. The proof will be absent. The fact would be paltry. The article would not include vital elements of the case. But a good story is what sells sometimes especially when politicians have their friendly neighbourhood publications. “Friendly media” proceeded to do just that, today, with the Tulsi Prajapati encounter case of 2006. Evidently, Sandeep Tamgadge, the chief investigating officer in the 2006 Tulsiram Prajapati encounter case, has said that BJP president Amit Shah and IPS officers D.G. Vanzara, Dinesh M.N. and Rajkumar Pandiyan were the “principal conspirators” in the controversial killing. A shocking statement that would raise alarm bells in every citizen’s mind. The media has splashed this statement everywhere. “ If one bothers to look beyond the headline that almost reads like it has been written it caps with several exclamation points and prefixed with “SHOCKING”, one realises the pointlessness and perhaps the viciousness of the story. The Print, however, one has to concede was far more honest than The Wire. The Print ran the PTI copy that said (emphasis added): It is interesting that The Wire leaves out this aspect altogether. In their long report, not once do they mention that the CIO who is accusing Amit Shah and others of being “chief conspirators” does so right before conceding that he has no documentary evidence whatsoever to support the claims he made in the charge sheet filed by him. The Wire goes on to play up Sandeep Tamgadge’s statement, says that these revelations come at a “crucial time” since “witnesses” have been turning hostile. The article, however, fails to inform its readers that the court observed that political undertones  were attached to this case. When Amit Shah was exonerated in December 2014, judge MB Gosavi at a special court run by CBI had said: The other bit of “incriminating evidence” against Amit Shah was that there were several calls made during the time to DG Vanzara. It can only be called outlandish that “they talked many times” would be a pivotal piece of evidence, but it was. And as such, it was thrown out by the court summarily. In the revelations by Tamgadge, he says, “There was some incriminating material against the trio. But those statements were not filed in the charge sheet.” This is right after he said he had no documentary proof. The defence then moved an application, saying the CBI should produce these statements in the court. The court will hear the application Thursday. In fact, on April 8th, 2013 the Supreme Court had clubbed the Prajapati case with the Sohrabuddin case. Quoting from a The Wire article itself which was written by the same journalist on 20th November 2018: The Wire article excitedly goes on to claim that the court can still summon Amit Shah if it likes without invoking double jeopardy. It mentions in passing that Amit Shah was exonerated in the Sohrabuddin case as well. In fact, The Wire beautifully dons the role of the investigating officer themselves. In today’s article while reporting Tamgadge’s statements, other than leaving out the fact that he himself has admitted that he has no documentary evidence to back his claims, The Wire article says this: The Wire assumes that Amitabh Thakur, who was investigating the Sohrabuddin case had evidence from his investigation which he purposely failed to “reiterate” when he took the stand. However, as one recalls, Amitabh Thakur had himself proclaimed that none of the “accused” had a motive to carry out the killing. On what basis did The Wire draw the conclusion, one would never know. Here is another flimsy charge that The Wire drummed up as a sensational revelation. The Wire says: The keyword in this sentence is “EVEN WHEN”. Tamgadge says that Ashish Pandya shot himself in the arm to show that he was injured during the alleged encounter. The forensic report, however, does not conclusively say that the gunshot wound was indeed self-inflicted. It says that “such an injury is possible EVEN WHEN it is self-inflicted”. For anyone who knows the English language even remotely, it would be evident that this forensic report seems no proof at all if it says what Tamgadge is claiming it says. The observation clearly means that it could be inflicted by someone else, but, such an injury can also be self-inflicted. That is no proof. Coming to the other aspects which were conveniently left out by The Wire. Recently, Sohrabuddin’s brother had himself said that Amit Shah’s name was added  in the case as a conspiracy in 2010, under the Congress regime. Nayamuddin Shaikh, the youngest brother of Sohrabuddin Shaikh revealed  to a special CBI court that the CBI had on its own added the names of Gujarat police officer Abhay Chudasama and BJP President Amit Shah to his statement recorded in 2010 relating to the Sohrabuddin encounter. In fact, Arun Jaitley in 2014 had also spoken about  file notings that revealed  how the Congress government and CBI wanted to frame Amit Shah and ultimately, Narendra Modi in the case. It is worthy to recall here that Sohrabuddin Sheikh was accused of possessing 40 AK-47 assault rifles that were recovered from his house in 1995. Sheikh was a notorious underworld criminal with links to the Sharifkhan Pathan alias Chhota Dawood and Abdul Latif  gangs, and with Rasool Parti and Brajesh Singh, both known to be close to India’s underworld kingpin Dawood Ibrahim. Tulsiram Prajapati was Sohrabuddin Sheikh’s close aide. It is believed that Prajapati was an eyewitness in Sohrabuddin encounter case. Then, The Wire article brings up the Ishrat Jahan case. Tamgadge was also the officer overseeing the Ishrat investigation. The Wire tried to drag the names of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi into the case by saying that the people accused were close to the both of them. Some facts of this case, have been obviously left out by The Wire. Ishrat Jahan was an LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba) operative. This was a charge widely rejected by Congress and other politicians. Some even branded her ‘Bihar ki Beti’. Pakistani-American terrorist David Headley dropped a bombshell. Headley told the court  that Ishrat Jahan was a member of LeT. Headley said Lakhvi told him about the botched up operation in India by Muzzamil Butt. He was told that a woman named Ishrat Jahan was killed in the shootout. Headley had revealed this even to the FBI during his disclosures in the US. It was also revealed over and over again the Jahan and others had plans to assassinate Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat. Despite Congress’ efforts to implicate Amit Shah in the encounter of Ishrat Jahan, even in 2013 , under the Congress government, the CBI had decided to not include Amit Shah’s name in the charge sheet because there was just no evidence. CBI, under Congress, had said that there is no evidence to link Amit Shah to Ishrat Jahan encounter. In 2014 again, the CBI reiterated exactly the same . In fact, According to RVS Mani , Kamal Nath had met him in Urban Development Ministry, had allegedly asked RVS Mani to change the narrative of the Ishrat Jahan encounter case to implicate Narendra Modi, who at that time was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and further the Hindu terror narrative. He claims that there was pressure on him to declare Ishran Jahan as an innocent, so as to implicate Narendra Modi in her ‘encounter’. RVS Mani has claimed that Kamal Nath, who was accompanied by two other officers, requested him to alter the facts of the matter, but RVS Mani then had insisted to present the facts and refused to indulge in falsifying any evidence. The reply by Kamal Nath to RVS Mani’s statements, if believed to be true is rather shocking. According to the Mani, Kamal Nath offensively replied, “ There is another curious aspect of The Wire report. In their last paragraph, The Wire says,  To substantiate this charge, The Wire only refers to another The Wire article written by Ashish Khetan, the former leader of Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party. The Ashish Khetan report too gives no further references. This specific charge only appears in The Wire and we couldn’t find any other reference to substantiate this claim. This entire shoddily constructed article full of half-truth was plugged by Congress President Rahul Gandhi. He used this story to say that BJP should not have “such a man” as its President perhaps forgetting that Amit Shah has been exonerated and it is Rahul Gandhi, in fact, who is currently out on bail in corruption charges. It is evident that as these concocted cases breath their last with the Congress ecosystem that was used to frame the BJP leadership  slowly being dismantled, these utterings and intermittent screeches are merely an attempt to keep these issues alive for political gains. The truth, however, is far more complex and how the Congress misused state machinery to concoct Hindu terror and implicate Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, albeit unsuccessfully is for all to know. The friendly neighbourhood publication The Wire has often peddled half-truth that has then been latched on to by Rahul Gandhi to throw mud around hoping something hits the target.  There is perhaps a reason why Rahul Gandhi chose to plug friendly The Wire and not friendly The Print because the latter actually included the fact that Temgade himself conceded that he had absolutely no documentary proof to back his claims up.",2018-11-22,"Amit Shah,cbi,Central Bureau of Investigation,Encounter,Media,Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,sohrabuddin encounter,Special Court,supreme court,The Print,The Wire",Media spreads half truth on the Prajapati encounter case so that Rahul Gandhi can spread whole lies,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/tulsiram-prajapati-sohrabuddin-shaikh-amit-shah/

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is likely to address  at least 10 rallies from November 25 to December 4 in poll-bound Rajasthan. These rallies are being seen as a big boost for the BJP and would be instrumental in setting the public mood in Rajasthan. This is equal to the number of rallies scheduled for Madhya Pradesh where the PM is expected to address the people. On November 25, the PM will head to Rajasthan to address the first rally in the state in Alwar. He is scheduled to fly to Madhya Pradesh later to address the last two rallies of his schedule in Vidisha and Jabalpur. On the next day, the PM is scheduled to hold rallies in Kota, Bhilwara and Baneswar Dham. On November 28, he is expected to address public gatherings in Bharatpur and Nagaur. On the same night, PM Modi is scheduled  to leave for the G-20 summit in Argentina from Delhi. The PM will be away for the five-day summit returning only on December 2 night to the country. Once he comes back he will immediately hit the campaign trail again by returning to Jodhpur on December 3. The PM will finally wind up his campaign in Rajasthan on the next day on December 4, by doing three rallies in Sikar, Hanumangarh and the last rally of the campaign in the state capital of Jaipur. “Almost all divisions of Rajasthan are being covered by the PM rallies. We expected a massive change in the mood once the PM is here,” a senior BJP functionary in the state told the Economic Times. The PM is an accomplished orator and his speeches see massive gatherings during poll campaigns.

81,OpIndia Staff,"The report states that it was 'error in working by the public near the railway lines', it has added that the train was running at a speed well below the permissible limit and braking was not possible at such a short distance. The Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS) report investigating the Amritsar train tragedy in October has concluded that it was the negligence of people which led to the terrible incident. According to reports , the CCRS provisional report has the tragedy had happened due to “error in working by the public near railway line”. The CCRS has stated in its provisional report  on Thursday that it was the negligence of the people that led to the tragedy. Over 60 people were killed and several others were injured when a train had mauled down people gathered to watch the Dussehra celebrations near the Jaura Phatak area at Dhobi ghat grounds in Amritsar on October 19, 2018. The Commission of Railway Safety works under the ministry of civil aviation and deals with rail travel safety and investigates train accidents. Chief of the CCRS, SK Pathak has reportedly mentioned in the report that the spot of the accident was just 20 meters ahead of an S-curve and hence the train was not visible from a long distance. The report also adds that due to the firecrackers going off during Ravan Dahan, there was smoke in the are and it further brought down visibility. It also adds that though the permissible speed limit in the area was 100kmph the train was running at 82kmph and despite the driver of the locomotive applying brakes, the braking distance of the train was found to be 389 meters during trials. The report also states that 50 policemen were present at the site and though they had tried to move the people from the tracks, the people did not obey. The report also holds that the district administration and the organisers should have given a prior intimation about the event to the railways. It has urged the state police and Government Railway Police (GRP) and RPF to hold regular meetings for better coordination regarding the upcoming events. The report also urges state administration to organize awareness programmes for people living in the vicinity of railway tracks. It is notable here that soon after the incident was reported, many senior journalists and politicians had rushed to blame the railways for the incident. Well-known journalists  like Rajdeep Sardesai, Shekhar Gupta, Rohini Singh, and many others had immediately blamed the railways and even union minister Piyush Goyal for the incident. Even Congress minister Navjot Sidhu , whose wife Navjot Kaur  was present as the chief guest of the event and had reportedly fled from the site after the tragedy, were seen blaming the train driver and railways for the incident. The railways, from the beginning, had maintained that the incident had happened due to sheer negligence of the people trespassing the railway tracks and neither the driver nor the railways can be held responsible. Later, leftist propaganda website The Wire had shared a video by journalist Abhisar Sharma  where he had claimed that the tragedy had occurred because the train did not have a ‘top light’. When it was pointed out to him that most modern locomotives do not have a ‘top light’ but bus like front-lights below the windscreen, Sharma had again tried to deflect the blame claiming it was a design flaw. After widespread criticism over their half-baked data and gross misinformation in the video, The Wire had later deleted it.",2018-11-23,"Amritsar Train tragedy,Captain Amarinder Singh,Congress,Indian Railways,navjot singh sidhu,piyush goyal","Amritsar Train Tragedy: Railways get clean chit in CCRS report, negligence of people blamed",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/amritsar-train-tragedy-railways-get-clean-chit-in-ccrs-report-negligence-of-people-blamed/

After all the controversy surrounding the Mizoram Assembly polls, that led to the removal  of Chief Election Officer S B Shashank by the Election Commission on November 15 due to his support for the voting rights of Bru refugees, the ECI has finally allowed  Bru refugees to cast their votes in Mizoram polls. The polling for the Bru refugees, currently lodged in six relief camps of Tripura, will be held at the inter-state border village of Kanhmun in Mamit district of Mizoram. As told  by an officer in the CEO office, “We have been informed by the Election Commission  that the polling for the Brus must be arranged at Kanhmun village inside Mizoram territory. We have started our preparations for that.” “In the last three years, there was no revision of electoral rolls. This time we did that. The Bru refugees are registered in nine assembly constituencies and we will place different voting machines accordingly at the special booth in the village,” the officer said . “To smoothly carry out the entire exercise, we’ll take help from our counterpart in Tripura,” he added. According to the final electoral roll published on September 27 this year, Mizoram has 7,68,181 voters. “The Election Commission has issued necessary instructions in this regard and voting for people from North Tripura will take place in the 15 polling stations,” Chief Electoral Officer Ashish Kundra said. Bru organisations will be holding meetings to decide whether to participate in the polls. L Laldingliana, president of the Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Coordination Committee said they wanted the old system of voting in the refugee camps to continue as voting turnout would be low if people are made to travel. “If we have to come to an interstate polling station, transportation and food have to be arranged.

A local court in Jodhpur, Rajasthan on Thursday admitted a petition against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over the anti-Brahmin post shared by him on the Twitter which had resulted in massive uproar in the country, reported  Live Law. According to the reports , the petition was filed by Vice President of Vipra Foundation’s youth wing, Rajkumar Sharma, over a controversial photo shared by Dorsey in which he posed with some women journalists holding a placard reading ‘Smash Brahminical Patriarchy’. HM Saraswat, counsel for the petitioners said that Metropolitan Judge Rachan Bissa has admitted the petition and listed the matter for hearing on December 1. Sharma further added that the post was anti-Brahmin and used coarse language, which was humiliating and thus, intolerable for the community. HR Saraswat has reportedly said  that the petition has been filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), 500 (defamation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). “He (Dorsey) has committed the crime of triggering hatred for a community and we would proceed against him in the court,” he added. Meanwhile, Rajkumar Sharma has said that even though Twitter has issued an apology against its statements but Jack Dorsey has not issued an apology pertaining to the issue. Even if he apologises, it would not mitigate his crime, he added. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, during his visit to India, became a part of a bizarre incident after he endorsed  a far-left Hinduphobic slogan by holding a placard that said “Smash Brahminical Patriarchy”. This had caused a huge furor in the country after several people accused the Twitter CEO of promoting caste divide and attempting to incite people by showing its hatred towards one particular community. After a massive outcry over the social media, Twitter had issued a statement  regarding the shocking incident of Brahmin bashing and had to apologize to people profusely for hurting the sentiments. Twitter had also issued a statement  regarding its CEO posing for a photo with a placard  claiming that it was not a statement from their CEO but merely a reflection that they hear from all sides.

Congress friendly media is cute. In what appears to be the ‘fax’ moment  for Congress leaders and Congress-friendly media, journalist Pallavi Ghosh took it upon herself to convey it to Congress candidate from Nathdwara, Rajasthan, CP Joshi that Congress President Rahul Gandhi is upset with his comments  and wants him to “express regret”. CP Joshi, while addressing an election rally in Nathdwara had made a casteist comment on PM Modi suggesting that only people belonging to the Brahmin caste have the rights and knowledge to talk about Hinduism. After much outrage on social media, Congress President Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to condemn Joshi’s statement. At 10:39 am, Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Party leaders should refrain from making comments which could hurt any community in the society. Three minutes later, Pallavi Ghosh announced that Rahul Gandhi has stepped in to condemn CP Joshi. She even went on to cite sources who said that senior Congress leaders had conveyed it to Rahul Gandhi that Joshi’s statements may damage the party headed by a Janeu-dhaari Brahmin. She even complimented Rahul Gandhi of showing courage to pull up their erring colleague in public. After all, any such statements could damage to the dynasty, and in turn the party. Notice how Ghosh feels that such remarks ‘damage the party’ and not the society at large? Then, as if on cue, at 11:01, 20 minutes after party chief had ‘pulled up erring colleague in public’, Ghosh, too pulled up Joshi in public. She conveyed it to CP Joshi that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has asked him to express regret. Joshi, too, following instructions immediately, within 8 minutes of Ghosh’s tweet, expressed regret. Pallavi Ghosh has earlier quite a few times answered curious questions on behalf of Rahul Gandhi and Congress. Like, she knew the criteria  for inviting the ‘women journalists’ for a closed-door, off the record interaction with Rahul Gandhi in July this year. Amidst all the fawning over Rahul Gandhi, she often cites ‘sources’ for the things which Rahul Gandhi has planned to do, like more hugs . Pallavi Ghosh had also come to Congress IT cell head Divya Spandana’s rescue  when the latter had a Twitter meltdown recently over an image of PM Modi she tweeted. In the tweet, Divya had compared PM Modi with a bird dropping, but Ghosh’s source (it is always a source, hmm) had clarified that Divya didn’t mean the PM.

86,Abhishek Banerjee,"Everything they see makes them want to get up and “Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy” and burn Manusmriti. But the one time they hold their peace is when a Congress leader throws casteist slurs at Narendra Modi. No expressions of regret, no half measures can make up for the kind of casteist language  that Senior Congress leader C P Joshi has used yesterday. Absolutely unpardonable. This is outright casteist name-calling directed at the PM and a Cabinet Minister. And don’t miss the reference to “pandits” … remember that Jawaharlal Nehru is often referred to as Pandit Nehru. The only way Congress can possibly atone for this is for Rahul Gandhi to personally apologize to PM Modi and to Uma Bharti. Instead, Rahul Gandhi came up with a response that didn’t so much as condemn C P Joshi’s remark explicitly. Wow! Merely expressing confidence that C P Joshi will eventually realize that he has done wrong and suggesting that C P Joshi should express regret. No condemnation. No apology from Rahul Gandhi. Not even regret from Rahul Gandhi. No expulsion of C P Joshi. Didn’t even ask C P Joshi to apologize, merely suggested that he should express regret. To a casteist element like C P Joshi, this would feel more like a pat on the back. The toxic, casteist messaging has been coming from the topmost levels of the Congress Party for a while now. The remarks of C P Joshi can only be seen as an addendum to those of Congress’ official spokesperson Randeep Surjewala when he explained that Rahul Gandhi is “ The meaning was already crystal clear when the Congress said it at the time. That among the Hindus, the Congress believe there is something very special about being a “janeudhari”. What is special Rahul Gandhiji? Tell us, please. Around the same time, Mani Shankar Aiyar referred to PM Modi as “neech”. At the time, the media made it appear as if Aiyar had thought of using that expression all by himself. But before this Priyanka Gandhi had herself used the word “neech” for Modi. Today C P Joshi’s remarks merely provide a confirmation of the thinking within the Congress party. So it is not like C P Joshi’s words should surprise anyone. Earlier Ghulam Nabi Azad himself had described Modi as a”Gangu Teli”, another direct reference to Modi being born in the Teli caste. We have seen  Congress cadre using posters such as this that leave nothing to the imagination. And yet Rahul Gandhi doesn’t apologize. Doesn’t expel C P Joshi. Doesn’t even condemn. And neither will anyone from India’s liberal intelligentsia, media or academia condemn C P Joshi. We have had a few stray reactions from them in which they have only expressed irritation at C P Joshi possibly jeopardizing Congress prospects in the Assembly Elections happening less than a week from now. Not one condemnation. Not one call that Rahul Gandhi should apologize. Where is the entire caravan of Indian liberal revolutionaries who spend their lives delivering heady speeches against caste repression? I remember one JNU professor who said that Hindu society is the “most violent in the world” because of its repressive caste hierarchy. I would like to know what she has to say about these remarks from Rahul Gandhi’s man. They get triggered by everything: by the lighting of “Hindu looking” ceremonial lamps, by women wearing sarees, by rasam, by bhajan sandhyas, by Hanuman posters, everything. Everything they see makes them want to get up and “Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy” and burn Manusmriti. But the one time they hold their peace is when a Congress leader throws casteist slurs at Narendra Modi. They are still mad at Manu for what he said 2000 years ago. But they have already forgiven C P Joshi. There is a lesson here for all of Hindu society to remember. Just in case you haven’t figured out the reality of these “activists”, it could not be more clear today. They don’t care even a tiny bit about justice. Their only aim is to divide and defame Hindus, to put them on a defensive, so that they the liberal elite may rule over them. That is why their idea of smashing “Brahmanical Patriarchy” is to get the OBC Prime Minister voted out of office, to be replaced by a fifth generation ‘janeudhari’ dynast.

He said that people are fed up with the BJP citing results of Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha by-polls where BJP lost to SP-BSP alliance. He further added that there is anger among students, farmers against BJP and a third front alliance is the need of the hour to oust the BJP in the upcoming elections.

Expressing his dissatisfaction over forming an alliance in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh, Akhilesh Yadav said that only third front with regional parties coming together can work for the betterment of the Madhya Pradesh.

He said that had it not been Eid and he had received the fax, he would still have dissolved the assembly. Malik clarified  that he took this decision since he had been hearing news since last 15 days of threats to MLAs and parties contemplating distributing money to get MLAs to switch sides. He said that from the beginning he was against the formation of government without elections because of possibility of horse-trading. Yesterday was an eventful day for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

90,Shreyash,"If the verdict goes against our petitioners, consequences will be disastrous for Rahul. The Supreme Court has reserved its decision on the Rafale deal  signed by the Narendra Modi government. As per various reports, they are currently examining the details submitted by GOI in response to the petition. The verdict can go either way. But what will be the political implications of this verdict (only with respect to LS 2019)? Let us try to examine. The questions our petitioners are trying to ask are, Though this is a best-case scenario for Non-BJP parties, BJP’s loss will not directly translate into a direct gain for INC. In politics, uncertainty is a helpful tool. As long as Rafale was being used to build uncertainty in the voter’s mind, it was useful. But now, this seems like “cut the branch that you are sitting on” kind of a strategy. This is no longer a zero-sum game. In case verdict goes against the government, the opposition will be able to stand and make a fight out of it but is by no means a winning shot. Modi will no longer flaunt his non-corrupt image but it will be very difficult for the opposition to label PM as corrupt based on procedural lapses. Plus the Indian Air force has at multiple times made a case in favour of the aircraft, so deal in itself will never be in doubt.

92,OpIndia Staff,"Badal praised the Modi government for forming the SIT and taking the case to its justified conclusion. Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday said that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) conducting the 1984 Anti-Sikh riot probe should summon the UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi to question them in connection with the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots case, reported  ANI. Sukhbir Singh Badal reportedly  said that the mother-son duo should be put through a lie detector test to find Congress party’s involvement in the killings of Sikhs in Delhi and other places after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. “SIT should summon Sonia Gandhi as the conspiracy (1984 anti-Sikh riots) was hatched at her residence and her husband was in power. Captain Amarinder Singh should also tell her (Sonia) to go for a lie detector test,” Badal said as quoted by news agency ANI. Sukhbir Badal’s statement comes in the wake of the recent judgement  delivered by the Delhi court which awarded death sentence to one convict Yashpal Singh and life term to Naresh Sehrawat for the killing of two Sikh men in Mahipalpur village in South Delhi in 1984. “The Sikhs were butchered under the supervision of Rajiv Gandhi. He purposely didn’t call the Army for four days. The decision to kill Sikhs was taken at his residence,” Badal said in Delhi. Expressing his satisfaction at the Delhi court’s judgement, Badal said that justice has been served for the victims after 34 years. He went on to slam Congress by accusing Congress of attempting to shelter perpetrators of ‘1984 Sikh Genocide’ and said that the attempts of the Congress party have been defeated due to the efforts of the SIT. , Badal also lauded the Narendra Modi-led NDA government and said, “All this has been possible due to affirmative and decisive action taken by the NDA government which formed a SIT in 2015 to take massacre cases to their logical conclusion.”Reportedly “I join the Sikh community in expressing satisfaction at just punishment to the two convicts. Now it is the turn of the two big butchers of Delhi – Tytler & Sajjan to face the hangman’s noose. The Sikh community also awaits unmasking of the role of Gandhi family and other Congress leaders in the execution of the genocide and hopes they also will be proceeded against as per the law,” tweeted  Badal.

I remain on cordial terms with Mr Verma and it is only the professional engagement that has ceased,” Shankarnarayanan said. Shankarnarayanan held the communication gap between the office of Senior Counsel Fali S Nariman and himself responsible for his withdrawal from the case.

After several organisations filed pleas in the Kerala High Court against the prohibitions imposed by the Kerala government at Sabarimala, a Division Bench of Justices P R Ramachandra Menon and N Anil Kumar has issued  an interim order against these restrictions. The court on Wednesday ruled that Sabarimala pilgrims should not be prevented from moving in groups and chanting ‘Ayyappa Keerthanam’ (devotional songs) on the pretext of maintaining prohibitory orders at the shrine. The Pinarayi Vijayan government had imposed  certain restrictions following the protests by the devotees against the Supreme Court verdict allowing entry of women of menstruating age in the temple. The government had imposed  Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code at the Sannidhanam, Nilakkal, Pamba, Elavugal etc, banning more than 3 to 4 people assembling in these areas. Private vehicles were also banned beyond Nilakkal and people were also prevented from climbing the temple post 9 pm. KSRTC bus services were not allowed after 8.30 pm. The court said that the imposition of Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more persons, is meant to ensure smooth movement of pilgrims. The judges said that since going to the temple in groups and chanting Keerthanams (devotional songs) is part of the pilgrimage, these cannot be prohibited.   While  Bharatiya Janata Party state General Secretary K Surendran  and 70 people who were arrested in connection with protests at Sabarimala have been granted conditional bail by the Pathanamthitta magistrate court which ordered them not to the enter the Ranni area for the next two months. Hindu Aikya Vedi state president, K P Sasikala  was also granted bail.

On 19th, DIG Sinha had filed a petition against his abrupt transfer to Nagpur on October 24, the same day the union government had sent the CBI director and special director on leave pending enquiry against charges against them. Sinha had sought an urgent hearing on 20 Immediately after that, the petition found its way into media, which got wide coverage from various media houses. The petition indeed made many shocking allegations, even dragging the name of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval into the murky CBI vs CBI drama, alleging he had interfered in CBI investigations. The Supreme Court was not at all happy with this publication of the petition and commented that the appellant does not deserve a hearing for this. Now, the same petition has raised alarms bells at the security establishment of the government. Other than Doval, the Sinha’s petition had also made allegations against law secretary Suresh Chandra. Sinha claimed that Chandra was in London on November 8, and on that day Sathish Sana Babu, who has claimed to have paid a bribe to Rakesh Asthana, talked to Chandra on the London number of the law secretary. The petition says that Sana spoke to Chandra on Whatsapp on the evening of 8th November. It claims that Chandra was in London for some work related to the Nirav Modi case, and he was trying to contact Sana for 4-5 days convey the message of Cabinet Secretary Shri PK Sinha that the Union Government will offer full protection to him. But on a serious twist to the case, Law Secretary Suresh Chandra has claimed that he was not even in London on November 8. He told  Times of India that he has visited London only once this year and that was in July. This revelation has raised the possibility of sensitive numbers being put under illegal surveillance, and also the possibility of obtaining SIM cards in the name of prominent persons or even cloning their numbers to frame them. Sinha had claimed  that Ajit Doval had instructed CBI Director Alok Verma to stop an ongoing search on CBI officer Devender Kumar. The claims by Sinha implies that phone numbers of Ajit Doval and other high officers were put under surveillance. And as Chandra was not in London in November, a question arises whether someone else was using his number London. The question also arises whether phone numbers of high ranking officials were cloned and then illegally being tapped to frame them. According to an official, “this reads like the perfect script of a frame-up. You can arrest anybody on the basis of an alleged call and he will not be able to prove his innocence until the trial starts and the fraud is exposed by forensic examination.” Tapping someone’s phone requires the approval of the home secretary.

BJP President Amit Shah addressed  rallies in Lawngtlai and Vairengte in Mizoram. He promised to make Mizoram secular and peaceful where all sections of society will develop. Shah promised to give more power to Autonomous District Council (ADC) in the Sixth Schedule of the constitution. “When people of Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh can bring progressive BJP Government why can’t Mizoram also be part of the BJP family. BJP government has put an end to the era of bandh and blockade and controlled armed groups in different states,” said Shah. Shah said that Tourism potential of Mizoram could not be utilised due to lack of road connectivity. He attacked Congress for playing with the emotions of people of Mizoram and for bringing the ‘Vote for money’ culture in the State. Meanwhile, the Mizoram Church has taken  an anti-BJP stand urging the congregation to abstain from voting for the BJP. The Church has issued a guidelines booklet asking the voters to keep the interests of the community in mind while casting their vote. Earlier, the Nagaland Church had also taken a similar stand before Nagaland elections about nine months ago. The Mizoram Church has questioned BJP’s decision of observing Christmas Day as the Good Governance Day. The Church feels that if BJP is voted to power the religious freedom will be under threat and the interests of Christians will be ignored. The comments from the Church came despite Amit Shah’s assurance of making the State secular and peaceful. The Church’s attempt to influence the voters by creating a fear psychosis appears to expose its communal agenda. The church plays an important and influential role in Mizoram politics. Earlier, Mission for Christ had expelled  one of its full-time missionary for joining BJP to contest the assembly elections. Congress President Rahul Gandhi also attacked  BJP while addressing an election rally in Champhai. Gandhi said that the BJP has an understanding with the Mizo National Front. He accused the BJP of trying to enter Mizoram with the help of regional party Mizo National Front (MNF). “In Mizoram, MNF has opened the door for RSS to enter the state. It is sad that the MNF is helping these people who are attempting to destroy the culture, language and religion of Mizoram,” claimed  Gandhi. He said that the Congress will protect the history, idea and culture of Mizoram. “BJP and RSS want to impose only one ideology. They know that they cannot come to power in Mizoram or India next time, so they are putting RSS people in the institutions like RBI, CBI and Election commission.

99,Jhankar Mohta,"Lately, the ‘opportunistic alliance’ between Congress and JD(S) in Karnataka is a perfect example of this impetuousness With an intention  to not let Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regain power in Jammu and Kashmir, rival parties are said to be in talks to join hands to form the government. According to sources , Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP, the Congress and the National Conference are in talks with each other to form a coalition government in the region. Jammu and Kashmir has been under Governor’s rule since BJP pulled out of the ruling coalition with PDP on June 16. Governor’s rule cannot be extended after it completes its six-month period on December 19. According to the Governor, Satyapal Mallik, though there are proposals to impose President’s rule thereafter the 87-member Assembly is not being dissolved. There have been speculations amongst various political circles that confidentially, efforts were in progress to prop up a government headed by Sajjad Lone’s People Conference. Though People Conference has only two MLAs, it would be banking on support by the 25 MLAs of BJP. However, this combination would fall short of the required majority of 44 which is sought to be made by splitting the PDP which has been rocked by dissidence . The sources reveal  that the mainstream parties, primarily the PDP, Congress and National Conference, who are apprehensive about a BJP backed government in the valley, have planned to get together to form a government.  to the plan which is being conceptualised, the PDP and Congress would form a coalition government backed from outside by the National Conference. The National Conference has made it clear though, that they are not interested in joining a coalition government, but would provide support from the outside, said sources. The PDP has 28 MLAs, followed by NC with 15 and Congress with 12 which will, presumably, make up for a clear majority.According If such an arrangement comes about, Mehbooba Mufti is unlikely to be the chief minister but the government may be headed by a senior PDP leader. The J&K’s political scenario, this year, has seen many highs and lows with the BJP on 19th June deciding to pull out of the alliance  with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir saying it is “untenable” for the coalition to continue. The National General Secretary of the BJP, Ram Madhav while speaking to the media had reiterated that “Keeping in mind larger interest of India’s security and integrity, the fact is that J&K is an integral part of India, in order to bring control over the situation prevailing in the state we have decided that the reigns of power in the state be handed over to the Governor.” In the 87-member legislative assembly in Jammu and Kashmir, the magic number to form the government with simple majority stands at 44. The PDP in its desperation to get back the reigns has reportedly decided to get together with NC, which is known to be a bitter rival of the PDP. PDP too seems to be going the Congress way. These sort of opportunistic alliances has become the latest strategy of the Congress party to match wits with the BJP. Getting together of parties with no common ideologies, just to gain power, has been the latest game plan the Congress has adopted, which in few instances has already boomeranged at them. Lately, the ‘opportunistic alliance’ between  Congress and JD(S) in Karnataka is a perfect example of this impetuousness . Craving  to form the government in Karnataka, which was evidently nothing but a compromise , the Congress and the JD(S) now, seems to be constantly grappling  to accommodate each other. Earlier, Kumaraswamy had broken down  saying he is swallowing the poison and had accused certain Congress leaders of ‘tormenting’ him. In August, the rift within the JDS-Congress alliance  had reportedly  widened as former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had expressed  his wishes to become the chief minister again. Congress has been trying hard to devise such ‘opportunistic alliances’ to portray a strong anti-BJP stand for the upcoming 2019 elections. However, internal turmoils and drifts which have been exposed so far depict that the ballgame the Congress is brewing might just slip out of its own hands, and leave the party oscillating.",2018-11-21,"assembly,Congress,congress-JD(S) alliance,Jammu and Kashmir,Karnataka government,mehbooba mufti,pdp,PDP-BJP alliance","Jammu and Kashmir: PDP, NC and Congress aim to form an opportunistic alliance to keep BJP out",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/jammu-and-kashmir-pdp-nc-and-congress-aim-to-form-an-opportunistic-alliance-to-keep-bjp-out/

The Republic TV has come out  with a video clip wherein Congress veteran leader, Kamal Nath is heard resolving to use the Muslim card, weeks before the Madhya Pradesh state elections. In a ‘behind-closed-door-meeting’, Kamal Nath is perceived saying that ‘only the Muslim votes can make the Congress party win’. Republic TV accessed the full controversial video, days after BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra released  a video clip of Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath entailing threats against Hindus and demanding Muslim votes during a private party meeting within the closed doors in Indore.

In the highly controversial video, the senior Congress leader asserted , “If we did not get 90 percent votes of the Muslim community then we will face a huge loss. We have the numbers. You know where the Muslims votes. You have to take care where those votes were cast. If we have received fewer votes then what are the reasons behind it. You have to postmortem the reasons behind it.” While addressing the gathering in the meeting, the senior Congress leader also made statements threatening the Hindus and RSS. Furthermore, in the video, Kamal Nath vehemently asks the Muslim leaders in the room to find out why members of the Muslim community didn’t come out to vote in sufficient numbers in the last assembly elections, which he attributes to the Congress’ loss. He declares that even 80 percent of the Muslim vote would be insufficient for the Congress and that only 90 percent of the votes can save them. To enable this, the leaders should do everything they can, go polling station to polling station, to find the voters. He adds that all this should be done before the election code of conduct comes into force.

103,OpIndia Staff,"Earlier, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram had said that Rahul will not be the PM candidate. Congress leader Veerappa Moily on Wednesday said that Rahul Gandhi is the ‘best material’ to become the Prime Minister of the country. “I don’t want to say that…. the question is that ultimately he (Rahul Gandhi) is the best material for the prime minister,” Moily said, as per reports . Moily also praised TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu and said that he was doing well to unite opposition parties. He said that Congress will win in all the five States (Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana) where Assembly elections are underway. “Things are shaping up so well, evolving so well, the opposition unity is becoming a reality, and the Congress party is picking up in all the five States. There is a likelihood of coming to power. Definitely, it adds up to the credibility of our leader Rahul Gandhi,” he said . Congress does not seem to be able to make up their mind about projecting Rahul Gandhi as Prime Ministerial candidate. Earlier, former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram had said  that Rahul Gandhi will not be Congress’ face for the PM in 2019 in Lok Sabha elections. Interestingly, Rahul Gandhi himself had expressed  the desire to become the Prime Minister at The Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2018. However, Rahul’s ambitions have not gone down well with the anti-Modi Mahagathbandan allies. Andhra Pradesh’s Telugu Desam Party’s minister Kalava Srinivasulu, had announced  that if the party goes for pre-poll alliance then the party will not accept Congress President Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate for the 2019 elections. Recently Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of CPI(M), had rejected  the idea of projecting Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The BSP is pushing Mayawati’s name as a Prime Ministerial candidate. Even Mamata Banerjee’s name is often projected by many as a probable PM candidate for the united opposition .

104,OpIndia Staff,"PDP, NC and Congress had come together to form a coalition government in the state, Sajad Lone making a counter-claim with BJP's support After a day of high political drama in Jammu Kashmir, the Governor of the state Satya Pal Malik dissolved the legislative assembly of the state today. The state was under Governor’s rule since June this year. An order issued by the Governor’s secretariat of Jammu and Kashmir stated that under the relevant clauses of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, the governor has dissolved the Legislative Assembly of the state. Earlier, former chief minister and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti had confirmed the speculations that the party is getting support from National Conference and Congress to form a government in the state. Media and Social Media was abuzz with speculations about this possible alliance the whole day today. On Twitter the PDP leader posted a copy of a later she has written to the Governor of J&K to inform about the alliance. She accused that she was unable to send the letter via fax to the Raj Bhavan, and the Governor was not available on phone. Therefore, she tweeted the letter on Twitter, tagging the official Twitter account of J&K governor. Mufti stated in her letter that governor must have seen media reports that National Conference and Congress have decided to extend support to PDP to form a government in the state. She informed that they will be seeking an appointment with the governor soon to stake claim for forming the government. She followed it up with another tweet informing that she is sending the letter also by mail. On the other hand, People’s Conference leader Sajad Lone had also sent a letter to the governor staking claim to form a government with the support of BJP. Lone also had informed that fax at the Raj Bhavan was not working hence he had sent the letter via Whatsapp to the PA of the Governor. After the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014, no party had won a majority to form a government. PDP had won 28 seats, BJP was in the second position with 25, while NC and Congress had won 15 and 12 seats. As no party or alliance was able to form a government, Governor’s rule was imposed in the state in December 2014. In March in the following year, PDP and BJP decided to form an alliance and PDP leader and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed sworn in as the chief minister. Mufti Mohammad Sayeed died in January 2016, and his daughter Mehbooba Mufti became the CM in April 2016, after a brief Governor’s rule. But there were serious differences between the alliance partners, especially on the handling of separatists by the Mehbooba government.

106,Nirwa Mehta,"It would be interesting to see reactions of the 'intellectual' friends of Congress on Manish Tewari's tweet where he takes a sympathetic view on the Brahmin community. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s maiden trip to India had its fair share  of controversies . Netizens got quite furious  when he posed with a far-left Hinduphobic slogan on a placard that read ‘Smash Brahminical Patriarchy’. ‘Brahminical’ is often used as a code-word to attack Hinduism just as anti-Semites use ‘Zionists’ to spread hatred against Jews. Congress leader Manish Tewari is the latest to join the debate. Manish Tewari tweeted that ‘Anti-Brahminism’ is the reality of Indian politics. In the post-Mandal era, the same got accentuated in North-Indian politics. He added that we (as in Brahmins) are the ‘new Jews’ and we must just learn to live with it. Mandal Commission was set up in 1979 by Prime Minister Morarji Desai to identify socially or educationally backward classes of India. The report recommended reservations to the scheduled caste, scheduled tribes and other backward classes to 49%. While the report was submitted in 1983, it was implemented only in 1992 amidst widespread protests. Criticising the reservation system, which focuses on caste over economic status, is often dubbed as ‘Brahminical privilege’. Hence, it is politically incorrect to be critical of the reservation system. Although there were mixed reactions to Tewari’s tweet, with some looking it as support for Jack, Tewari’s sentiments are not unique or new. A 2008 Outlook article  talks about how being against “Brahminism” is a part and parcel of Indian politics. In the article, researcher Jakob De Roover draws parallels between the Jews in Europe and Brahmins in India. Jakob mentions the striking similarities between the Jews in Europe and Brahmins in India like the stereotypes about them. While Jews are described as conniving people who could go to any lengths to personal gains, Brahmins are often described as oppressors. He explains that in both cases, the historians have claimed to have produced ‘evidence’ which cannot really be considered as one. He points out that when anti-Brahminical people are countered with facts that Brahmins in a major part of the country are not as powerful, and are in fact, poor, they resort to ad hominem by claiming that Brahmins were the ones who manipulated kings and politicians behind the scene. If you observe the Twitter discourse, self-proclaimed Dalit rights activists are out to set right the historical wrong done to them. As a sample, you could perhaps read the comments that would be targeted at me on the basis of my surname, Sharma (post-marriage) and Mehta (maiden), attacked for being a Brahmin, a ‘place of privilege’, speaking on the caste system. Targeting of Brahmins, which is politically safe in India, with the ulterior motive of fueling divide in the country is not unheard of. We had earlier seen how Pakistan based propaganda websites  indulged in such deeds. Thus, some people seeing red flag over an ‘outsider’ Jack holding this poster is bound to raise a few eyebrows Hence, it would be interesting to see reactions of the ‘intellectual’ friends of Congress on Manish Tewari’s tweet where he takes a sympathetic view on the Brahmin community. Especially since now Rahul Gandhi now identifies himself as a ‘Janeu-dhaari Brahmin ‘, the avatar of Congress President that was discovered during the run-up to Gujarat elections last year.",2018-11-21,"anti brahmin,brahminism,caste politics,Congress,Intellectual,intellectual mafia,Jack Dorsey,manish tewari,political correctness,rahul gandhi","After Twitter’s ‘caste’ row, Manish Tewari says Brahmins should accept their fate as Jews did",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/after-twitters-caste-row-manish-tewari-says-brahmins-should-accept-their-fate-as-jews-did/
107,Jhankar Mohta,"Recollecting these innumerable instances, one is only convinced that the Congress party has always used religion as a tool for politics, not as a matter of faith.  A controversial video surfaced recently wherein Kamal Nath is heard using the Muslim card , weeks before the Madhya Pradesh state elections. In a ‘behind-closed-door-meeting’, Kamal Nath is heard saying that ‘only the Muslim votes can make the Congress party win’. He declares that if 90% of Muslims don’t vote for them, Congress will be in trouble. One can argue here that Kamal Nath was assuming that a high voter turn out among Muslims will mean more votes to Congress. For a party that cries secularism at the drop of a hat and brands itself as the harbinger of secularism, to appeal to Muslims to save Congress, in its desperation in itself should be branded communal. With the Assembly elections fast approaching and then the 2019 elections looming large, the Congress seems to be getting increasingly desperate in its bid to garner votes. This statement is particularly interesting since it comes after Rahul Gandhi was declared a ‘janeu dhaari Brahmin’ in order to hold on the fast disappearing Hindu vote of Congress. Now, if Congress wants 90% of the Muslim population to come out and vote, which is a terribly high voter turn out to expect, to begin with, how would they go about ensuring it? In the normal course of things, to expect a 90% voter turn out is outlandish. So what is it that would convince 90% Muslims to come out and vote for Congress? Perhaps nothing drives a person like fear. And one would imagine that it is exactly what Congress would bet on. Fan the persecution fear psychosis with lies, fabricated data etc to ensure that the Muslim population comes out in larger numbers than usual to vote for Congress as their messiah. We have seen time and again how Congress has tried to create a fear psychosis amongst the minority community so that they are bound to choose Congress as their representative. From the narrative that BJP is out to neutralise all Muslims, to the skewed narrative of ‘Muslims getting lynched in Lynchian’, Congress has tried to convince the minority that if they are not voted back to power, it would spell doom for Muslims. However, creating fear psychosis and mass hysteria can’t be an easy task. And a party can only talk about this often behind closed doors and seldom, openly. To that end, to create ‘mahaul’, one would need other functionaries who do so with faulty data leading to faulty and dangerous narratives. It is, thus, unsurprising how that narrative was furthered by IndiaSpend’s fact-checking website, where it fear mongered liberally with faulty data . It shamelessly peddled half-baked data like 97% cow-related violence  happened only after 2014. It will worthy to note here IndiaSpend, which has been maintaining a fabricated database to portray Hindus as aggressors and Muslims as victims have Praveen Chakravarty  as its founding trustee . Praveen Chakravarty is also the head of Congress party’s data analytics department. Factchecker.in is the Fact-checking arm of IndiaSpend itself. Recently ‘factchecker.in’ started tracking ‘cow-related hate crimes’. They claim  that since National Crime Records Bureau does not collect data on cow-related hate crimes, they have collected the data of over eight years. While they claim that their data is collected from 2010, their database in 2010 shows zero ‘cow-related hate crimes’. As per the website in 2010 and 2011, no cow-related hate crimes were found and in 2012 and 2013, 1 incident each. All these 4 years were under the UPA. But could it be possible that no such incident took place in these years? This prejudice in reporting was evident as there were innumerable such incidents covered by mainstream media before the Modi government came to power, which the website conveniently chose to not include in its so-called fact-check. This narrative based on faulty data was then furthered by Barkha Dutt  and other publications  to claim that there was ‘rising hate’ in India. It is, of course, no surprise that the founding trustee is closely working with Congress and Rahul Gandhi. This one-sided, skewed narrative is what achieves the aim of creating the fear psychosis that will ultimately force Muslims to come out in large numbers and vote for the Congress as their saviour, considering Congress believes that it will be finished if 90% Muslims don’t vote for them. This biased reporting is not new. Earlier we had reported how Hindustan Times had started a similarly biased ‘hate tracker’  which focussed only on identity-based crime reporting of Dalits and Muslims. Their hate tracker also conveniently ignored hate crimes against people belonging to certain political or religious inclination and so were crimes perpetrated by people belonging to certain political or religious ideology. The ‘hate tracker’ was supposedly tracking hate crime from September 2015 onward, but had conveniently missed out on reporting hate crimes when the victim was a Hindu or the one time when one Farooq, who identified himself as an atheist and a free thinker was killed by a radical Muslim group. While organisations like IndiaSpend create the ‘mahaul’, Congress repeatedly furthers their plea to the Muslim community and pretends to be their messiah. Even earlier, a video surfaced  in which Kamal Nath was allegedly advising Muslims to remain patient till the assembly elections and said: “we will deal with them later”. BJP spokespersons suggested that the senior Congress leader Kamal Nath was talking about dealing with Hindus on behalf of Muslims. The party has been long known for appeasing the minority, who has been their core vote bank for decades. Sticking to its age-old tradition, the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had termed  Congress as a “Muslim party”. Rahul Gandhi is reported to have said so during a meeting  with ‘Muslim intellectuals’ on July 11. Taking cognizance of the social media posts and the report in Urdu media,  Nirmala Sitharaman attacked Congress saying that the party was trying to fight 2019 elections based on religion. Sitaraman further suggested that this statement by Rahul Gandhi should be seen in conjunction with ‘Hindu Pakistan’  statement by Shashi Tharoor and support  of Sharia Courts by Congress leaders. During Karnataka, Rahul Gandhi and his coterie had preferred to share the political bed with radical Islamist outfits like PFI and now, as 2019 nears, their aims seem to be to demonise RSS, a cultural organisation, to create a fear psychosis that might just help them recover from their dwindling political fortunes. And we remember the cable released  by Wikileaks where Rahul Gandhi was quoted saying that Hindu extremists were a bigger threat to India in the context of the Lashkar-e-taiba. Recollecting these innumerable instances, one is only convinced that the Congress party has always used religion as a tool for politics, not as a matter of faith. It has always attempted to put on a facade of ‘secularism’. And organisations like IndiaSpend and Factchecker.in only help them use that tool a little more effectively.",2018-11-22,"Congress,Fact Checkers,IndiaSpend,Kamal Nath,media lies,minority appeasement,Muslim Appeasement",This is how IndiaSpend’s faulty ‘hate tracker’ and Kamal Nath’s statements are related,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/this-is-how-indiaspends-faulty-hate-tracker-and-congress-leader-kamal-naths-statements-are-related/
108,OpIndia Staff,"Reports say the list aims to appease the disgruntled members ahead of general elections. This would not be surprising considering infighting has plagued Congress in many states recently. Congress President Rahul Gandhi took  eight long months to finalise and approve the list of 401 office-bearers in Gujarat Congress. List of Gujarat Congress office-bearers is even bigger  than All India Congress Committee (AICC) office-bearers. Gujarat Congress has 22 vice presidents whereas AICC has none! The humongous list has 43 general secretaries and 169 secretaries for Gujarat. AICC has 12 and 169 respectively. It is not yet clear what took Rahul Gandhi eight months to finalise the list. Last year, the same list had less than 150 members. Distributing everyone a piece of the power pie, Gujarat Congress released the list with an eye on 2019 elections. Along with this, a list  consisting of in-charge in each of 26 Lok Sabha constituencies was also declared. Controversial leader Alpesh Thakor  continues to be a secretary  in AICC. Alpesh Thakore allegedly  incited a mob to take to violence that led to an exodus of North Indians from Gujarat. Congress MLA Geniben Thakor caught spreading violence  on camera, is the general secretary in the new list. She had earlier declared if it were up to her, she would kill all BJP leaders  and go to jail. Congress leader Virji Thummar who hit a woman police officer  at a rally is a ‘permanent invitee’. Reports say the list aims to appease the disgruntled members ahead of general elections. This would not be surprising considering infighting has plagued Congress in many states recently. Poll-bound Rajasthan has witnessed a war  between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot, while Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijaya Singh  have drawn swords in Madhya Pradesh. Whereas in Chhattisgarh, Congress workers created a ruckus  after the party released the final list of candidates for assembly elections. With the war now reaching Gujarat and Congress doling out favours to keep the party together certain things become extremely evident. The Congress party lost its ideology a long time ago. For political parties to stay united in the turbulence of Indian politics, a central idea that binds the party workers and members are essential. It is telling that for the Grand Old Party is has now become imperative to hand out favours to ensure that their leaders don’t abandon the party. With the ideology gone and the dynasty losing sheen, plump posts even if it means sacrificing the party seems to be Rahul Gandhi’s mantra to not only keep the party together but save his throne as the de-facto Prine of the Dynasty.",2018-11-20,"2018 Assembly Elections,2019 lok sabha elections,aicc,alpesh thakor,Congress,gujarat,Gujarat congress,rahul gandhi","Gujarat Congress tries to please-all, declares a humongous list of 400 office-bearers after 8 long months",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/gujarat-congress-office-bearers-rahul-gandhi/
109,Anant Chetan,"By the way, magic tricks get old and magicians regularly update their magic tricks. There are tricks where the magician becomes the prop, for instance, he starts levitating or gets himself chopped into pieces. Would you be able to recognize if our magician becomes the hat? Think about it, is he acting like a magician or a prop? The magician borrowed a 10 rupee bill from a person sitting in the first row, he lit that bill up, I saw with my eyes the 10 rupee bill turning into ashes, but what he did next was impossible for me to imagine. He started scrubbing the ash between his fingers and 10 rupee bills, not just one but umpteen number of them appeared. I was quite young when I saw a magic show like this and I truly could not believe my eyes. I theorised and reached the conclusion that I want him to take a bigger bill from me and make zillions of it. When I told him that, he just giggled. Magicians are honest people; unlike some politicians, they tell you they’re gonna fool you, and then they do it. But they both work extremely hard and put a lot of research on captivating their audience. They uncover the way people perceive, with the sole intent of distorting their perception and forcing them to see something that does not exist. They confuse the audiences into seeing the future based on past experiences. The vanishing ball  is one such trick. The magician tosses the ball twice and the third time people assume that the ball went up and later get confused when they don’t see the ball coming down as per the law of gravitation. Rafale Deal is one such trick perfectly executed by our beloved magician. Bofors happened, it is a fact that has been proved. It does not matter who was involved or who got acquitted, but it did happen. They tossed up Rafale, memories enriched with a variety of scams along with Bofors forced people to believe the opposition. Now when the French government, their president, Dassault CEO say that it is not a scam, people are confused, once bitten twice shy. It’s like the skilful magician pulled a rabbit from his hat. A ball or a rabbit is not the only thing that could be made to disappear, a skilled magician could vanish anything and make something appear from nowhere. David Copperfield made the 310 feet high Statue of Liberty vanish. Someone magically even made a five-tonne elephant  appear from nowhere. Likewise, our magicians made Indian History vanish or rather a major part of it vanish. What existed before the British? Mughals. What was there before the Babri Mosque? Nothing. What was exists after the British? Bapu- Mahatma Gandhi, Chachu – Pt Nehru, Iron Lady- Indira Gandhi. Who brought Computers to India? Rajiv Gandhi. And that’s it! The uneasiness that we are witnessing amongst a certain group today is because somebody is revealing the tricks like a debunker who forces the audience to take control of their vision and look at a place where the magician does not want them to look. The elephant was right there all the time, and once it was explicitly told where to look, you never missed it again every time you saw the video. A skilled magician tends to exploit the fact that not everybody in the audience is Sherlock Holmes i.e. they will tend to ignore the present. They think they have a vivid and a detailed awareness of their surroundings , but the fact is that they will compute only a very localized set of visual data points leaving a large part unprocessed. With properly executed misdirection, people would ignore what is right in front of them and focus on the cues provided by the magician. But the big question is: What are our magicians trying to hide by all these tricks? The number of chief ministers from Indian National Congress has come down from 24 or 25 chief ministers in ’60s when there were only 24 or 25 entities  (states plus UTs) to 3 when there are a total of 36 entities (29 states and 7 UTs). The following graph  would give a picture of that. INC has been on the downfall for decades now. PM Modi has done exactly what a hardware accelerator does in an embedded system design; accelerate or increase the speed by several folds. Now you know what magicians are trying to hide; the destiny of Indian National Congress. As soon as the party failed to separate itself from a dynastic rule, it was destined to fall. There is no paucity of dynasties in Indian History. Starting from the Kuru Dynasty in 1200 BCE to Pallavas in 275CE to Mughal Empire in 1526CE (yes, history did not start with Akbar and Babar,  there exists some history of around three thousand years before they were even born) to the Scindia rulers of Gwalior from 1731 CE and so on and goes till now. What is one thing common to all of them? They all fell, some stayed longer, some vanished quickly, but they all fell. Why is every dynasty destined to be doomed one day? The rulers coming in the later part of the dynastic timeline simply are spoon fed. They never had to move a single muscle to build the empire, but they enjoyed the fruits of a being an emperor. The last ruler is always the weakest link. He is weak but offensive and thinks he could attack and win anybody. He is arrogant and self-centred to an extent that he starts thinking he is the kingdom and everyone else is to entertain him. Did any of the last dynastic rulers know that he was the last one? Did Bahadur Shah Zafar know he was going to be the last Mughal emperor? Did Nityapal know he would bring the five-century-old Chutiya Kingdom  (pronounced as Sutiya or Sadia) in Assam to ground? In fact, his inabilities were known right before the beginning, the nobles and ministers had resisted the decision of giving away the throne to him. With hopefully the last and possibly the brightest Scions at the helm or leading in different parts, it is highly unlikely for Congress to revive itself. However, if they see a small ray of hope they will try to drag their rule further, all dynasts do that and in the meanwhile bring misery to people. Indians got a chance to get rid of them for good in 2004 but they chose misery and pain for the next 10 years. They are standing again at the crossroads. It is not at all about why BJP should win, it is only about why Congress should not win anything till they let go of the dynasties . Congress would start resurrecting as soon as Dynasties are left behind. By the way, magic tricks get old and magicians regularly update their magic tricks.

111,OpIndia Staff,"Irani had contested from Amethi in 2014. She lost the elections but managed to succeed to reduce the Congress leader’s victory margin to 1 lakh votes in 2014, down from 3 lakh five years earlier. Taking on Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s bastion Amethi, Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Irani mocked Rahul Gandhi for distributing  Israeli origin Banana saplings to Amethi farmers. “I came to know that Rahul Gandhi is getting bananas seeds of foreign origin planted here, he could not get even banana plants in the country… he should know that poverty cannot be eradicated by planting a couple of banana saplings,” she said . Irani was in Amethi on Monday to inaugurate various schemes worth Rs 77 crores. She laid  the foundation stones of projects and dedicating infrastructure, including 49 connecting roads in Amethi among others. The Union Minister also called out Gandhi for criticising the RSS and yet taking ideas from them. “Rahul Gandhi criticises the RSS and Prime Minister Narendra Modi all over the country but he is treading the RSS path of planting banana trees,” Irani said .

Since then, the BBC has been busy removing the research from its website, uploading it, then removing it again. We have published  a series of articles on the BBC’s shoddy research where we have demonstrated that the researchers adopted inappropriate research methods  to reach fantastical conclusions in the BBC fake news research paper. Among other things, BBC’s research relied  on Leftist propaganda website AltNews and FactChecker, an arm of IndiaSpend, which has itself been maintaining a fabricated database to portray Hindus as aggressors and Muslims as victims. There are other discoveries that we have made that could reveal clear bias in part of the researchers. For instance, Praveen Chakravarty , the head of Congress party’s data analytics department, is a founding trustee  at IndiaSpend. The website of IndiaSpend, however, does not  mention him as one. Praveen Chakravarty got appointed as the head of Congress party’s data analytics department in February 2018, way before the BBC research started. Also, it is a wonder why the Indiaspend website makes no mention of Praveen Chakravarty. The BBC research had as its source, apart from AltNews and IndiaSpend, Boom Live and SMhoaxslayer. Now, IndiaSpend and Boom Live have a common link. They have the same founder , Govindraj Ethiraj.

On a particular occasion , the portal declared a journalist’s account of the ‘attack; on Umar Khalid ‘false’ without any evidence merely because it went against their narrative.

Pune Police claims  that the number enlisted by the Maoists in another letter as that of a ‘friend’ belongs to former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister. Since the investigation is still on and a major part of the same is pending, Singh may be called in for questioning.

The contents of the letter are still under investigation. Meanwhile, Singh has ‘dared’ the government to arrest him.

Hence, Pune Police suspects that Congress leaders mentioned in the letters are supporting the Naxal movement. Earlier this year, violence  had broken out in the Pune district, prior to the 200th celebration of a British victory over the Peshwas. This ‘victory’ has been spun by leftist historians  as a ‘victory of Dalits’, owing to the British army supposedly comprising of Dalits and other lower castes while the ruling Peshwas were Brahmins. In August 2018, several raids were conducted against supposed Naxal sympathizers in connection with the violence at Bhima Koregaon last year and an assassination plot to murder Prime Minister Modi.

Although both have levelled serious allegations against each other, Verma’s supporters have decided to ignore allegations against him and are trying to project him as a victim. As a part of that, left-wing propaganda website The Wire has been extensively covering Verma’s version of the events. On 17 The IRCTC Hotel tendering case relates to alleged irregularities in awarding the contracts of two IRCTC hotels in Ranchi and Puri to a private company in return for a prime commercial plot in Patna. This happened in 2005-2006, when Lalu Prasad Yadav was union railway minister in UPA I government. The two hotels originally belonged to Indian Railways, which was transferred to IRCTC in 2005. At the same time, Sujata Hotels sold  a plot of 3 acres worth ₹94 crore for just ₹1.47 crore to Delight Marketing Company Pvt. Ltd.

CBI special director Rakesh Asthana has been accusing that CBI director Alok Verma was trying to scuttle the case, in an alleged bid to protect Lalu Prasad Yadav. Going by The Wire report on Verma’s version, it is clear that Alok Verma is actually not denying the fact that he was delaying the case. He has offered some justifications for the same, which are actually quite bizarre for a premier investigation agency like CBI. Verma says  he was worried about the political fallout of the case. Now, in any high profile corruption case involving political leaders, there will be political implications. If a politician is caught in a scam, the opposition parties will gain. That is a natural side effect in such cases. CBI should concentrate on the investigation of the cases, not the political fallouts of the same. Verma says  that the case also had a “political angle”, and it was a politically sensitive case. He also justified his action saying there was a possibility of law and order problems in Bihar. He says that he feared that law and order problems could arise as a result of the agency’s searches at deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav’s residence and the houses of two former chief ministers Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi. This is one of the most bizarre justifications coming from a CBI director. Why should CBI not proceed with an investigation fearing law and order problem? CBI’s job is to do investigations and follow the due process, not worry about things not under its jurisdiction.  This argument raises some very serious questions. In how many other cases against powerful politicians the agency is going slow fearing violence? Was the agency threatened with violence if the investigation against Lalu Yadav and his family proceeds ahead? The justification given by Verma can also give a new tool to powerful and corrupt politicians, now they can threaten violence and law & order situation if the agency starts any probe on them.",2018-11-19,"cbi,CBI probe,irctc,Lalu Prasad Yadav,Rabri Devi,scam,Tejashwi Yadav","CBI Director Alok Verma’s justification for going slow in IRCTC case: Political fallout, law and order problem",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/cbi-director-alok-vermas-justification-for-going-slow-in-irctc-case-political-fallout-law-and-order-problem/
126,Giriraj Pai Vernekar,"Today, as Parrikar battles illness, the scene is rather sad. Apart from him, the party has no acceptable leader to run the ship, at least until Parrikar recovers fully. Congress & his critics may love to write him off but in true Parrikar style, he will return to run the state.  Political turmoil with 11 Chief Ministers in 10 years, deep-rooted corruption, inadequate infrastructure, electricity issues, water shortage and so on. All these issues and more plagued undoubtedly the most beautiful state in India in the nineties. With tourism and mining being the only mainstay, Goa was fast losing direction on social and economic front. And then, just like the phrase, ‘He came, he saw, he conquered’. Seems easy but rarely do we find somebody doing this, especially in the political sphere. What Manohar Parrikar did to the political scene in Goa and India is exactly the same. From being the son of a general store owner in the sleepy town of Mapusa to becoming an IITian to being India’s Defence Minister is a story that evokes curiosity, respect and inspiration. It will not be an exaggeration to call Parrikar Goa’s finest Chief Minister, tallest political leader and most popular citizen. From being a mascot of good governance to one of India’s best Defence Ministers, he wore many hats but never ceased to be the beloved Bhai of Goans. I was 10 when Parrikar first became an MLA from Goa’s capital city of Panaji. Despite being from Mapusa, considering political compulsions of an alliance, he contested from Panaji and won. As they say, the rest is history. From Panaji’s water woes to power issues to roads to cleanliness, he went about solving each issue one by one or simultaneously. By the time he was into a few months of being a legislator, he had already made a mark for his studious arguments, prolific speeches and vociferous support to causes in Goa’s interest. Within a short span of 6 years since his entry to the state legislature, BJP had its first government in the coastal state with Parrikar as Chief Minister. This was a turning point in Goa’s volatile, faction-ridden and defection prone political culture, despite Parrikar government itself being the result of mass defections. He provided a new boost to the aspirations of Goans allowing them to finally look at a governance model that was getting recognized across the country. He also provided the much needed political stability to the state. More often than not, Manohar Parrikar would barge into Government offices and take action against defaulting public servants. He would read each and every letter he received and address public grievances. He was the real-life Nayak supervising infrastructure work well past midnight, many times driving his own car, eating out at small eateries, getting rid of the concept of cavalcade and so on. In the era when children of ministers used police guards, Goans were pleasantly surprised to find a CM sans any protocol. I recall a moment in 2002 when a small get together of young RSS Swayamsevaks was organised at my house. When Parrikarji arrived in RSS uniform, most of us were blown away by his simplicity. Sipping his favourite black tea without sugar, he went onto address us with humour, wit, facts as well as his experiences as Head of the state government. The moment interaction ended, he moved towards the exit only to find it was raining heavily. Before an umbrella could be arranged, the CM had started running towards a private Maruti 800 waiting for him with his friend in the driver seat and zoomed away. No official vehicle, no red beacon, no security & no cavalcade. This may not seem like a big incident but it left an indelible mark on me and I found an idol in public life. Rather, most of us did! Despite alliance compulsions and political upheavals, he remained in the saddle till 2005 until the then Governor S C Jamir, Congress’s political missionary sent to Goa, dismissed the government keeping the assembly in suspended animation allowing Congress to use brute force, money and central agencies for horse trading. If Justice delayed is Justice denied, then the court’s dragging of foot in this clear case of the murder of democracy, denied justice to Parrikar as well as Goans. A union minister dictated Governor’s actions sitting at the Raj Bhawan. Today, when Congress cries hoax about the murder of democracy, you do not have to go as far as an emergency but can merely cite what Jamir did to Goa Government. While his term from 2000-2005 got him widespread popularity across the country, there were several factors that are often ignored. Parrikar lost his wife barely 6 months before he became the Chief Minister. With 2 young sons to take care of, youngest one being only 13, it was a tough ask to alternate his time between family & the state. But at no point, he allowed his family responsibilities to come in way of his duties as the administrative head of the state. He would often barge into offices early in the morning to see if staff was reporting on time, he would conduct public hours to meet as many people as he could to hear their grievances, all this, while taking his constituency Panaji as well as Goa to an all-time high in terms of development. While many criticized him for being arrogant, in reality, it was simply his ability to call spade a spade. Unlike most politicians Goa witnessed, there were no fake promises. Another aspect people often ignored was Parrikar’s accessibility which was unprecedented even for CMs of much shorter duration. With his simple dressing sense, shirt untucked and rolled sleeves, you would see him arrive at functions without any fanfare and just get merged into the crowd. Even before anyone noticed that CM was with them, he was generally on the road heading for another political engagement. While he remained down to earth and accessible, he wasn’t willing to compromise with state’s interest even for most compelling reasons. That eventually led to his downfall in 2005, which saw the most naked and blatant abuse of power wrested with the Governor and the central Govt that was on the prowl for an opportunity to bring Parrikar down, as he had become Congress’s biggest nightmare. In January 2005, on repeated complaints of corruption & harassment against one of his ministers, Babush Monseratte, who handled the crucial Town & Country Planning portfolio, Parrikar decided to strip him of the portfolio. This despite knowing that it could have severe political repercussions, including risking his government. And exactly the same happened. Babush resigned as Minister and MLA and decided to contest elections. With him, he made 3 more MLAs to resign and 2 others to withdraw support bringing Goa back into the political crisis, which was often an annual affair during the Congress rule. With Parrikar’s most trusted aide and virtual number two in the BJP, Digambar Kamat resigning and joining the Congress, the situation worsened. For Parrikar, it was a political as well as personal setback. Goa saw frantic efforts by BJP to stay in power, even by creating a constitutional crisis where both speaker and deputy speaker resigned. While BJP still managed to win the floor test, Congress did what they have done very well so far – used and abused the office of Governor. Without waiting for the court verdict, or getting into the merits of the floor test, Governor S C Jamir dismissed the government and proposed that assembly is kept in suspended animation till by-polls, instead of dissolution that BJP had demanded in the worst case scenario. After BJP lost 2005 by-polls 4-1, and the assembly elections in 2007, Goa wasted 7 precious years and possibly what was Parrikar at his peak. Back to back electoral failures had taken a toll on Parrikar’s approach though he went on meticulously with his role as Leader of Opposition. His antics in the assembly exposing the Congress and it’s government renewed people’s love for him. Yet again, he remained approachable and did not miss a single chance to be with the people or to interact with them. Until about January 2012, many believed that Goa will vote for a hung assembly. However, Parrikar did something unprecedented through his ‘Parivartan Yatra’, spread over 15 days, crisscrossing nearly 35 out of 40 constituencies, spending each night at the house of a karyakarta. A state already plagued by corruption, nepotism and failing law & order had nobody but Parrikar to look as their saviour. As elections drew closer, even his most bitter enemies in the media called him the miracle man who had the required Midas touch to heal Goa. 2012 assembly elections and Parrikar was back with a bang, with BJP getting to the magic number of 21 on its own and Congress decimated to 9 seats. While 7 years of Congress rule had messed state’s finances, UPA Govt in Delhi ensured Goa got no support. They would rather create hurdles at every opportunity available. Having said this, Parrikar himself was a pale replica of his first tenure from 2000-2005. 7 years of being out of power made him change his approach, become more accommodative, and that, did disappoint a lot of people. Even today, Goans complain of Parrikar not living up to his expectations but then, wasn’t it because of Goans alone that he spent 7 years out of power and was forced to be more accommodative? If one aspect of Parrikar’s leadership did not change and that was his push for infrastructure projects and social sector schemes. Like in his first stint, Parrikar went on an infrastructure building spree and also, announced several schemes helping the downtrodden and the needy in the state. When he has elevated as the Defence Minister of India, the entire state cried in unison. Yes, it was a proud moment for a state that had not even seen a Union Cabinet minister, that one of them was becoming India’s next Raksha Mantri, but as a Goan, it was a sad moment. The dreams, aspirations, expectations and so, many remained unfulfilled. Even though 2012 onwards saw Parrikar’s rise, it was possibly the most difficult time for him too. In Goa, he succeeded the mess left by Digambar Kamat for 5 years while in Delhi, he stepped into the mess created by the art of not taking a decision of Saint Anthony. Personally, I would rate Parrikar’s stint as RM as the best stint in his career. Given his position allowed him to focus on one sector, he meticulously went through issues of the Defence Ministry one by one. Whether it is about pending procurement cases, or new acquisitions, or issues of ex-servicemen or main operational issues, he carefully scrutinized each file slowly earning himself a lot of admiration from political circles as well the bureaucrats and the services. His approach was filled with analysis, intellect, and most importantly, empathy towards those protecting our nation. Even today, men in uniform call him the best Defence Minister India had so far and rue the fact that he did not stay long enough. Industry captains are usually compelled to speak highly about those power but even today, Parrikar’s contribution is remembered. One of the CMD of a large Indian conglomerate said Parrikar had done more work for the industry than all the RMs put together since the Defence sector was opened to the private sector in the early 2000s. His role in personally drafting the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016, placing long pending orders on private industry, making test ranges available and so on gave a new boost to Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India initiative. Whether as CM or RM, Parrikar remained firmly rooted in his karyakartas. I recall a call he received on his personal mobile. A longtime associate of his had taken a train few stations ahead of what was mentioned in his ticket. To his bad luck, he found a TTE who suggested that he should pay a fine. As a last resort, he called Parrikar even though he was the Defence Minister of the country asking him to either speak to the TTE or call Suresh Prabhu who was the then Railway Minister. Parrikar calmly told him to pay the fine and give him the receipt, which he will reimburse. Such is the connect he has with people and such are the expectations people of Goa keep from their leaders. Another incident worth mentioning is shortly after he became CM in 2012, he met a boy during one of his public hours. The boy told him that Parrikar, during his campaign speech, had promised a laptop to the students but he was not eligible due to some of the conditions. Parrikar immediately remembered where he had met the boy and called a friend who runs computer store to give the boy a laptop, for which, a cheque will be sent from his personal company. The memory of the smile on boy’s face is something that will remain in minds of each one who was there. Coming back to Goa, what transpired post-Parrikar’s elevation was partly a glimpse of his own failure to groom the second rung leadership. Yes, Parrikar’s void was too big to fill, but government led by Laxmikant Parsekar was disappointing on many counts. Even for trivial matters, Parrikar’s intervention started becoming a necessity, who despite his tough and gruelling schedule as RM, was forced to pay attention to the state. With administration taking a huge hit, even relationship with allies started worsening and this once again showed BJP Goa’s over-reliance on Parrikar. At a time when he was gaining stature nationally as well as internationally, Parrikar’s absence from Goa cost BJP a drubbing in the 2017 assembly polls, forcing him to return to state politics. He did not think twice before giving up his position as RM to come back and serve his state as it’s Chief Minister. Today, as Parrikar battles illness, the scene is rather sad. Apart from him, the party has no acceptable leader to run the ship, at least until Parrikar recovers fully. Congress & his critics may love to write him off but in true Parrikar style, he will return to run the state. Party leadership in Delhi, however, needs to now focus on creating the much needed second rung leadership. With most people in the core committee lacking electoral experience and solely owe their existence to Parrikar, Amit Shah should possibly look at letting younger people get active within the party. Though appointment of Pramod Sawant as Speaker and recent induction of Nilesh Cabral as Minister is a positive sign, BJP Goa certainly needs a lot more. Today, they can no longer rely on the charisma of Parrikar alone. While he takes care of Governance, the party needs a captain to steer the ship to its erstwhile glory. The core committee, as it stands today, does not enjoy the support of the party cadres beyond a certain coterie. With allies like Goa Forward looking at expansion right into BJP strongholds, the party needs to reinvigorate its cadres.

A section expressed doubts in the leadership of Chandrashekhar alias Ravan, the president of Bhim Army, and constituted Bhim Army 2 on the lines of Bhim Army under the leadership of Lokesh Kataria. Founder of Bhim Army 2, Shiva Gautam, has levelled serious allegations against Bhim Army president Chandrashekhar.

Recently a memorandum has been given to the District Magistrate for the release of innocent prisoners lodged in jail, and a major agitation will be made soon,” he added.

128,Jhankar Mohta,"Tickets to parachute-landers and relatives of senior Congress leaders have led to rebellions in the party After several rounds of marathon meetings Congress, Thursday released  the first list of candidates for the Rajasthan assembly elections. Contrary to Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s claims  about not fielding “parachute” candidates, the party has given tickets to at least 6 people who joined the party recently. Former BJP MP Harish Meena, who had switched over to the Congress on Wednesday, November 14, has been fielded from Deoli Uniara, Habib Ur Rehman from Nagaur, Sona Devi Bavari from Raisinghnagar and Khanhaiya Lal Jhawar from Bikaner East seat. Former IPS officer Sawai Singh Godara has been fielded from Khinvsar seat. ‘Parachute candidates’ are people who because of being denied tickets by their own party, are quick to change loyalties in the hope of getting the ticket from the other party. Rahul Gandhi, known for his tall talks, while addressing  a gathering of party workers at Ramlila grounds in Jaipur in poll-bound Rajasthan in August, had assured his workers that, “Before every election, parachute candidates come and take tickets. This time I guarantee that not one parachute candidate will get tickets. I will cut strings of parachute candidates.” He had reiterated that “Leaders from other parties are welcome in the Congress. But they will not be given Congress tickets to contest the election in the forthcoming assembly election. Such leaders will have to work for the party for five to six years before they are considered for tickets.” However, his announcement was belied when the first list of candidates  for Rajasthan assembly election was released late last (November 15) night. It so seems that either Rahul Gandhi promised too soon or simply went back on his promises. In another such display of hollow pretence, Rahul had affirmed that the party would only give tickets to those who genuinely work for the party and that no tickets would be offered based on any relationship with existing party leaders. Contradicting his claims, family members of over a dozen senior Congress leaders in the state have been given tickets. In another such hogwash , Rahul had confidently denied giving party tickets to candidates with criminal proceedings against them. Ironically, Malkhan Singh Bishnoi’s son, Mahendra Bishnoi and Mahipal Maderna’s daughter Divya Maderna have been given tickets. Both Malkhan Singh Bishnoi and Mahipal Maderna are in jail in the Bhanwari Devi murder case. Tickets to parachute-landers and relatives of senior Congress leaders have led to rebellions in the party. Incidents of protest have been reported from some parts of the state. It would be interesting to see what damage control measures would Rahul Gandhi adopt now, considering that his loose talks and false promises have this time bruised his own party members.

131,OpIndia Staff,"Commenting on the stand-off between the RBI and the government, Gurumurthy said that it is not a happy thing at all. He indicated that differences could be a result of considering only the American system as the perfect ecosystem. RBI’s independent director S Gurumurthy, who was delivering a lecture  on ‘State of the Economy: India and the World’ at the Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), said  that demonetisation was a corrective measure and the GST was a reformative one. Gurumurthy who was appointed to the board of RBI governors few month ago, said  that 18 months prior to demonetisation, 500 rupees, 1,000 rupees (notes) rose to 4.8 lakh crore that is what funded the real estate and gold prices and we would have gone the same way, (as what happened in) 2008 in the US due to sub-prime lending. The economy would have collapsed but for demonetisation. He said that people of this nation should be congratulated because they stood in the queues to collect the new notes. They put faith in the government while the media and the economists were finding faults. He said that fault-finding is the job of opposition and experts and media should not do that. He expressed disappointment that there is no economic discourse in the country and not political discourse is there. Gurumurthy also said that India is not a market-driven economy like the US where the stock market is the prime mover, while the banking industry is a subordinate player. He said that in the US, 75% of the money comes from the stock market while in India only 3% of the savings go into the stock market. But our policymaking is based on the US model. “So in a bank-driven economy, if you restrict the banks, you are restricting the economy. You are restricting the flow of funds into the economy,” he said. He criticised the government’s decision of giving up the right to print money in 2002. The only way in which Indian Rupee gets generated is when the RBI acquires dollar coming into India, it prints the Indian rupee in exchange for the dollar and gives it to banks. He said that demonetisation and the GST hit the small and the medium enterprises the most. “We need proper discourse in Delhi because that’s where the action is”. Gurumurthy said the country has been following an “utterly wrong import policy” of having capital goods import exceeding oil imports. “We need to go in for heavy import restrictions. We have got to cut down the current account deficit and trade deficit in the next one year,” he said . Commenting on the stand-off between the RBI and the government, Gurumurthy said  that it is not a happy thing at all.

Sidhu raised the Godhra bogey as well despite the fact that no evidence was ever found of Narendra Modi’s personal involvement in the riots as the then Chief Minister of Gujarat. Sidhu has come under severe criticism  from all quarters for attending Imran Khan’s oath-taking ceremony as Prime Minister amidst the troubled relationship between the two countries in recent times. He was criticized  by Punjab Chief Minister himself for hugging the Pakistani Army Chief. People on social media were not pleased with Sidhu’s latest remarks accusing the Prime Minister of jealousy. Some were wondering if he was issuing such statements to deflect attention from the Amritsar Tragedy. We had reported  earlier that a video had emerged where the event organizer could be heard boasting about people standing on railway tracks for Navjot Kaur, wife of Navoj Singh Sidhu before an incoming train killed many standing on those very tracks.

Muslim leaders across the political spectrum have written  a letter to Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis demanding reservation in Jobs and Education sector for the minority community. Dhangar community leaders joined them for the demand as well. The demand comes a day after the backward class commission report pointed out the socio-economic backwardness of the Marathi community. Joining the bandwagon, the leaders representing the Mulsim and Dhangar communities have asked for a reservation for their communities. They have requested CM Devendra Fadnavis to grant five per cent reservation for their community in government jobs and education institution. However, Hussain Dalwa, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha, allegedly stated that the Muslim minority committee is asking reservation not on the grounds of religion, but on the socio-economic backwardness of the people of their community. The Dhangar (shepherd) community who are represented by the ruling BJP party have been demanding the government to include their community among the Scheduled Tribes since 1980 but with little success. Representing Dhangar community, BJP MP Vikas Mahatme, urged  the state government to take a pro-active stand and recommend the decision to the Centre. “The decision to include Dhangars in the Scheduled Tribe category vests with the Centre,” he said. Currently, the Dhangar community is under the OBC category. However, if the community gets categorization under the Scheduled Tribe section, they will enjoy relatively greater privileges in terms of social welfare schemes, education, and government jobs.

The Andhra Pradesh government, through an order issued dated 8 The order says that in an exercise of the powers conferred by section 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, the Andhra Pradesh Government is withdrawing the general consent accorded to all the members of Delhi Special Police Establishment to exercise the powers and jurisdiction under the Act in the State of Andhra Pradesh.

If a state government does not give its consent or withdraws such consent given earlier, the CBI has to withdraw from the state.

137,OpIndia Staff,"Congress party workers created ruckus and protested violently at the party office in Kota after Congress high command suspended Spardha Choudhary for a period of six years for indulging in anti-party activities on Friday. The 2018 Assembly Election season is just heating up and seems like Congress is caught right in the middle of that heat. A video has now emerged of several Congress workers protesting outside Sachin Pilot’s house in Delhi allegedly over ticket distribution for the upcoming Rajasthan Assembly Elections . The protesters even stopped Pilot’s car from leaving the area. In the video, one can see several Congress workers shouting slogans and protesting against Scindia. One can even hear a woman screaming, asking Sachin Pilot to get out of his car. The protests have erupted after massive cash for tickets scandal has broken out within the party. Two Congress leaders, one who was suspended by Congress, have alleged that the party exchanged tickets for money in Rajasthan. Congress party workers created a ruckus and protested violently at the party office in Kota after Congress high command suspended Spardha Choudhary for a period of six years for indulging in anti-party activities on Friday. After a meeting between high ranking functionaries of the Congress party which included President Rahul Gandhi, Sachin Pilot, Ashok Gehlot and Rameshwar Lal Dudi, the decision to act against Spardha was taken even though her supporters were protesting outside their party president’s residence. The protesters accused Pilot of sidelining Spardha and giving the Fulera ticket to Hari Singh in exchange of money. Spardha spoke to Republic TV  and said that the party may have suspended her for 6 years, and she attributed her suspension to Sachin Pilot plotting against the workers who have been working for the party for the past 15 years. She says that Pilot wanted to ‘suppress her’. “He wanted to suppress me, a woman who has made it to the top on her own, because of which everyone reached outside Rahul Gandhi’s residence and wanted answers from Sachin Pilot as to why he doesn’t want us to contest the elections. All the women workers have been sidelined by the party in the state”, she said. She then lashed out at Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said, “All the big claims by Rahul Gandhi about empowering women and youth, and now when the time came for him to act, he kept quiet. I don’t understand what happens inside, where money is given, from where money is taken. I can’t tell any of this. Congress just talks, and today I gave a befitting answer to them through the protest outside Rahul Gandhi’s residence. If fighting for the people and asking for your rights is indiscipline, then I accept it. Congress will suffer.” Farmer leader Baran Ramesh Meena alleged that on the order of ex-minister Pramod Jain Bhaya, his ticket was cancelled. Speaking to Republic TV , he said, “Whatever Rahul Gandhi said about rich not getting ticket and poor getting a chance, it is not happening in our district. This all has happened under the command of Pramod Jain Bhaya. There was exchange of ticket for money.

Along with TM Krishna, several other artists including the veteran performer Sonal Mansingh was also to perform. After news of TM Krishna performing at an AAI event, several protests erupted. AAI has specified that it had decided to call off the concert citing “exigencies of work” . “Because of some exigencies of work, we are not in a position to go ahead with the dance & music concert jointly organised with SPIC MACAY on 17th and 18th November 2018 at Nehru Park, New Delhi. Hence, we request you to kindly postpone to a new date and inform all concerned. The new date will be discussed with SPIC-MACAY soon,” the email said from AAI to SPIC-MACAY said. TM Krishna, a notable Carnatic music artist, has been in news for his contentious views  on Carnatic music after he had announced that he would compose and sing Carnatic songs to gods of other religion. His statements to belittle age-old traditions of Carnatic artform had caused furore across the country. Veteran artist Sonal Mansingh, who was also to be a part of the concert has today written an op-ed on Indian Express, not only slamming Krishna for making this cancellation a ‘freedom of expression’ cause, but also for his political activism. Krishna had said “Give me a stage anywhere in Delhi on November 17, I will come and sing. We just can’t let ourselves be cowed down by this kind of threats”, right after the event had got postponed. Sonal Mansingh has written that all artists need to be prepared for their shows getting reschedule or cancelled and turning this into a freedom of speech issue is not acceptable. She said that artists are conscious keepers of society and hence, it is necessary that artists always speak facts. She said that TM Krishna’s political views are well known and that has never prevented him from performing anywhere, and it is concerning that a narrative which doesn’t exist is being furthered. She writes: She also expressed concern over TM Krishna’s political activism. She said that disagreeing with authority is all well and good, but the personal tone is concerning. The vitriol against Prime Minister is his political activism, and it is fine for artists to be political activists, but they should explicitly say so. She also expressed concern over several people attaching everything to Prime Minister Modi and seeing his invisible hands no matter what happens. After talking about the emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, she writes: She says there is no moral superiority in being an artist or an activist, but it is wrong for an artist to behave like a vicious political activist while demanding the rights of an article.

139,Karan Bhasin,"The entire analysis is just wishful thinking on the part of Shivam Vij as he picked up the data point from at least a year ago when we were just witnessing the revival of the rural economic activity post the initial transition period of demonetization and GST. It has become a routine for commentators to talk about a “rural distress” and base it as the sole basis of an electoral forecast. It is hilariously amusing as well as concerning to note the growing divide between the fate of Rural India and what the commentators sitting in Delhi make of it.  by The Print, authored by Shivam Vij, talks about why Prime Minister Modi may lose the election due to a prevalent “rural-distress” which may dampen the electoral spirits of NDA in 2019 just as it did in 2004.An article published The entire analysis is just wishful thinking on the part of Shivam Vij as he picked up the data point from at least a year ago when we were just witnessing the revival of the rural economic activity post the initial transition period of demonetization and GST. It’s almost hilarious to pick up a data value from a year ago and construct an analysis for the coming year and base the outcome of the State Elections as an indicator of the existence of a “rural-distress” or the absence of it. As far as the electoral contest is concerned, I believe the outcome on 11th December would invariably give a sound answer to these commentators as the rural sweep is well on the cards across the three states that were mentioned by the author. But the issue is not about whether there will be a rural sweep or not, but the issue is on this ill-founded pessimism on the Indian Economy at a time when our fundamentals are strong. In a separate article I will certainly provide my projections for the Financial Year (FY) 2018-19 but let me provide a very brief response to the article. The article in question talks about an economic slowdown that is being projected for the year ahead. Will there be a slow-down in the economy? Compared to the GDP growth rate of 6.7% in FY 2017-18, growth will only accelerate in FY 2018-19. Q1 FY 2018-19 estimates were at 8.2% which clearly shows that there’s no case to argue for an Economic Slowdown in the year FY 2018-19. Yes, global growth will slow-down in this fiscal but then, the last couple of years saw a marginal increase in exports so the impact of a global slowdown may not be as severe as being projected. The reason behind this is the strong growth in demand that India has witnessed this fiscal and a bulk of this demand has come from the rural areas . The article also cites Increasing Oil Prices to be a downside risk to India’s growth, but it conveniently ignores the moderation in the international oil prices and the impact of India’s treaty to purchase Oil from Iran along with the waiver from sanctions that the US has provided to India. Clearly, the author does not understand macroeconomics and has failed to provide an argument so as to why a slowdown is possible in this fiscal. In fact, the projected forecast for the FY2018-19 is of 7.2-7.5% GDP growth rate which is considerably higher than the 6.7% FY 2017-18 estimates, so the entire argument of a slowdown is façade and should not be taken too seriously. Another issue he highlighted was on the rural wage growth rate using the CMIE data. Let us debunk this myth. The real rural wage growth for men and women has been positive which means that even after inflation adjustment, the incomes increased between January 2017 and January 2018. With an increase in nominal wages and low inflation, real wages are bound to increase compared to the year before. Even though the growth rate slowed a bit in January 2018 from January 2017, given that it’s still positive it shows that the wages are growing. Another thing worth noting is that PM-ASHA has come into effect so the growth rate in real rural wages have started to accelerate since the last month. This in itself represents the fact that the data point considered in Shivam Vij’s article published in The Print does not take due cognizance of such facts and latest available data. As a result, it would be unwise to draw any inference based upon the data point used by the author in their original article. Besides, another important issue is of low inflation, as highlighted in the original article. Without due consideration of why there is low inflation, he has made an assessment on rural distress. The price realization and farm income have gone up in this Kharif season due to PM-ASHA which means that food inflation should have gone up. Despite that, the reason why the key inflation indicators remain is due to the fact that GST has reduced the effective tax rates on most commodities. It is this fact along with the structural transformation that the Indian Economy is undergoing which is ensuring that the inflation figures continue to remain consistent within the 5% mark. The increase in the sale of tractors along with the strong rural demand further indicates the absence of a rural distress. The entire narrative of rural distress is a convenient illusion of those who are trying to speculate a repeat of 2004 like outcome in 2019, but what they seem to undermine is the impact that schemes like Ujjwala, Swachh Bharat, Saubhagya electrification scheme, PM Awas Yojna and Ayushman Bharat are going to have in transforming the lives of the poor who reside in Rural India. I may not be surprised if, on the 11th December, we witness a strong rural sweep, a trend which may very well continue in 2019. For all the wishful thinking of such analysts, it is about time they go to the ground and see what the pulse of the people is, for Delhi gives a very wrong idea of what people of India feel.",2018-11-16,"Economic growth,fact check,Farmers,media bias,Media Lies List,modi government,Narendra Modi,shekhar gupta,shivam vij,The Print",The Print uses year old data to predict doomsday for BJP in assembly elections,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/fact-check-shivam-vij-the-print-farmer-distress-uses-old-data-predit-defeat-modi-government/

Dilip Singh Judeo took this menace head on and stopped Jashpur from becoming another Bastar.” “The Hindu society offers milk even to snakes despite knowing that they may bite later. Hindus are the greatest society in the world because we always believe in sacrifices”. “We Hindus never believe in the forced conversion like others.

These mafias remind me of Italy. The mafia word originated in Italy,” Adityanath said, in another apparent swipe at Gandhi.

143,OpIndia Staff,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi are facing charges for corruption and tax evasion after the firm Young Indian, allegedly controlled by them, took over AJL. Haryana state Governor, Satyadev Narayan Arya sanctioned  a proposal on Thursday to prosecute Congress member and former chief minister of Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda in a case of illegal re-allotment of land. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had submitted an affidavit to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. In it, they alleged that Hooda in 2005, misused his official position to re-allot some land in Panchkula to Associate Journals Limited (AJL), the owner of the National Herald. The ED’s affidavit came in response to a petition that Congress leader Motilal Vora, filed before the high court. Vora is the chairman of AJL. He had appealed that the agency’s enforcement case investigation report should be quashed. In May 2016, the bureau had registered  a case against Hooda for cheating and corruption in re-allotment of the land AJL in Panchkula by HUDA. The case was then transferred to CBI in December 2016. At the time of the allotment of the plot, Hooda was the chairman of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). Both Central Bureau of Investigation and ED are investigating the case. The investigators claimed that when in power, Hooda had overlooked the recommendations made by both Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and the Financial Commissioner of the Town and Country Planning Department “in order to show favour to the petitioner”. HUDA allotted AJL, the publisher of the National Herald newspaper, 3,360 sq. meters of land on August 24, 1982. The land was, however, taken back by the state government in 1992 for non-completion of construction within the stipulated time. AJL appealed against this but was turned down. After which it approached the chairman of HUDA where it was pending till Hooda took over in 2005. HUDA, which was then headed by the Congress member, re-allotted the land, in violation of its own policy and law, to AJL at 1982 price. In May 2016, state’s Vigilance Bureau registered an FIR against Hooda, and the case was transferred to CBI in December that same year. Earlier this month it was reported  how the central government had sent a legal order  to AJL, the Congress’ mouthpiece National Herald  publishers, to vacate the premises allotted to them at Press Enclave called the ‘Herald House’. AJL had then approached the Delhi High Court against the central government’s orders. The order was to vacate the premises they occupy in Delhi.

He also accused Congress of being anti-poor and anti-development.Campaigning Taking a jibe at Shashi Tharoor’s recent remarks  crediting Jawaharlal Nehru for a chaiwala becoming a Prime Minister, PM Modi quipped if he will also attribute decades of Congress misgovernance to Pandit Nehru. He dared Congress that if they really respect democracy and Nehru’s nurtured system, then why not appoint any rational Senior Congress leader as their President for 5 years and not a Gandhi family scion. He also said that Congress cannot digest the fact that a poor Chaiwallah rose through the ranks to become PM. Hailing Demonetisation as a huge success, he claimed the money that came through it was utilised for developing roads, hospitals, and schools in the rural areas. Taking a dig at Congress leaders, Modi said ‘darbaris’ who have had a habit of stashing away their ill-gotten wealth under their bed are still reeling from the whip of Demonetisation. ”They are asking me to explain the progress made by our government in the last 4 years, I ask them what development did they bring in their 4 decades of Gandhi dynasty rule. I am used to giving my 4-year report card to the people daily.” PM Modi said. Stressing on his government’s accomplishments, Modi announced that about 22000 poor families have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Chhattisgarh’s Sarguja district alone. About 1.25 crore people got their accounts opened in the Banks for the first time in Chhattisgarh. A total of about 50 crores people will be enrolled in Ayushman Bharat Yojana which provides with a medical insurance of Rs 5 lakh every year. Modi said that his government has implemented several projects which were pending for decades. He said that the past governments ignored the pleas of the armed forces to implement One Rank One Pension (OROP), but a government led by a chaiwala has implemented it. Modi said that the promises of Congress are lies, their people are liars, what they tell are lies, their issues are also lies, in a way, lying is an integral part of them. Lying is their habit, they kept the nation in darkness with lies. The second phase of polls in Chhattisgarh is scheduled to take place on November 20.

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday assured  that the menace of Naxalism will end in next three to five years. Rajnath Singh asked Maoists to join the mainstream by surrendering under the rehabilitation policy for them. The Minister who was in Chhattisgarh  for a two-day election campaign told the reporters, “Naxalism will end in next three to five years. The surrender process is continuous and the government has decided to make the rehabilitation policy more effective.” Singh said that Maoism is going through its last phase and it has been reduced from ninety districts to ten or eleven districts. He appealed to the Maoists to surrender and assured them of providing benefits of rehabilitation policy being pursued by the government. The minister mocked the Congress which has not yet declared their Chief Ministerial candidate in Chhattisgarh. “Congress is moving ahead with a marriage procession without the groom,” he commented. “The Congress, as well as all opposition political parties, have been currently facing a crisis of credibility. The Congress has lost its inherent strength which is the base of any political party.

146,Saket Suryesh,"While there are interesting stories around Teja Loan Scam and Mundhra Scam under Nehru, looking at Rahul Gandhi's fascination with Defense deals, this was the most pertinent. This could possibly in a way explain how Rahul Gandhi is battling these personal demons in his own dynastic family, and as Nietzsche wrote that if one gazes into the abyss long enough, the abyss gazes at the person. I guess the abyss is gazing into Shri Rahul Gandhi. When dynastic Prince Rahul Gandhi declared after losing Delhi election to the Prince of Propaganda, Arvind Kejriwal, that Congress ought to learn the tricks of the trade from the AAP, not many realized that he was looking to learn the worse of Arvind Kejriwal’s media-heavy politics. The new political strategy of Rahul Gandhi was built around the politics of continuous throwing of charges on the opponent, without any care in the world about the authenticity of them, in a hope that some of it will stick. Even though, Rahul Gandhi still thinks it is a fun game of sorts to keep throwing charges on the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and keeps on promising the people Abhi Aur Mazaa aane waala hai (There is more fun down the line); to the common citizen, it is fast getting tiresome. As the leader of India’s oldest political party, he does not care the way his baseless charges are destroying institutions in India. He has always been a non-serious politician, even during the time when his own party was in power and he was busy tearing away the cabinet-cleared ordinance. When he began walking down Kejriwal’s path, media as the fourth Pillar of democracy, ought to have censured him; but with their own ax to grind against Narendra Modi, they rather hailed this careless conduct of the man-child who claimed to be ready to become the Prime Minister of the world’s largest democracy in the world’s oldest civilization. When one hears Rahul Gandhi, one wonders as to from where he gets these fanciful ideas wherein he claims that Rafale  is a case of corruption, whereas per him INR 30,000 Crores have been given to Reliance of Anil Ambani and the Aircraft has not arrived. Why is he appearing like a desperate man who disbelieves every person in authority chasing the Windmills? His speeches are getting more and more repetitive. He keeps on harping about Rafale, only the figures involved in the corruption keeps changing  based on his memory and mood. With all the privileges of being part of a family, known for corruption, political and financial both, he seems to have turned into what  This is the unfortunate start, India as a democracy got with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, as the first of the dynasty at the head of an infant democracy, who believed that with his own imaginary hardships during the freedom struggle, earned him a right to rule the nation as his personal fiefdom (A well-researched book,  When one lives among demons for long, one begins to imagine them. This seems to have happened with Rahul Gandhi, given his own family history. A conniving and subservient media created an image of infallible hero out of Nehru. By ensuring that we forget the past, as the saying goes, we, as a nation, were condemned to repeat it, again and again. What Nehru gave to us immediately after independence was an immediate brush of scams in defence deal, courtesy VK Krishna Menon, often called as the second most powerful man in post-independent India, after Nehru. VK Krishna Menon came from a background similar to that of Nehru, both belonging to the influential and rich lawyer family. Post-independence how Nehru parked his near and dear ones in governmental positions of power, is a long story. To look only at corruption in defence deal, could give us an idea as to from where Rahul Gandhi might be getting his ideas and it might not only be Bofors. In the year 1948, India came under attack from Pakistan in Kashmir. The Indian Army was short of around 4000 Jeeps. While 1000 were imported from the US, the initiative to procure remaining 3000 Jeeps began in the earnest. A team of Defense Secretary, Commander of Chief of Army and Financial Adviser were sent to the UK but were unsuccessful to obtain the required vehicles. In June 1948, Mr AK Chanda intimated back home to India that he was able to locate around 1500  reconditioned Jeeps at 300 Pounds a piece. He was given the go-ahead to procure 2000 of such Jeeps provided three years of spares availability could be ensured.   The supply was to begin in 6 weeks and complete in 5 months time. While the messages were being passed through Mr Chanda, then financial adviser, later he submitted that the entire transaction was negotiated and concluded by Shri Krishna Menon. Without running it through the process, the order of INR 8 Million placed on the Company, M/s Anti-Mistantes with the capital assets of merely 605 British Pound Sterling (something equivalent of INR 8022.00 at the 1948 Conversion rate). Payment Terms negotiated by the Nehru prodigy, Shri Menon was also exceptional and a testimony of ease of doing Business in Nehru era. The terms were 65% on receipt of Pre-shipment Inspection certificate, 20% on production of Bill of lading and 15% within a month of receipt of the Jeeps (on Indian Port). An industry-friendly Nehru Government, however, could not bear the pressure of waiting for the pre-inspection certificate and released the 65% of payment within a month of ordering, ostensibly because Government believed without this funding, the company might not be able to produce the Jeeps for supply. The officials appointed for the inspection were changed at the direction of Krishna Menon. Even before even they could inspect the goods, a payment of Sterling Pound 172000 was paid to the seller. Later, the inspection clause was relaxed to sample 10% inspection. As per the contract, the first date of shipment was 23rd August 1948 and the deliveries were supposed to end by December 1948. On 26th December 1948, Krishna Menon assured the Indian Government that 1300 Jeeps were on the way. 155 Jeeps reached Madras in March 1949 and not one was found serviceable. This was two months after the ceasefire in Kashmir. Regarding the support, instead of required spares for three years, 10 percent were delivered. In the meantime, Shri Krishna Menon, a man of indefatigable spirit, signed another contract with M/s SCK Agencies, London for the supply of 1007 Jeeps are the rate of 458£ per Jeep and the supplies were to be staggered as 68 Jeeps per month. Krishna Menon reduced this 68 to 12 a month for initial six months, and to be increased to 120 a month, thereafter. This meant around 72 Jeeps in 6 Months. The firm supplied 49 of them and backed out. Unperturbed Krishna Menon signed another Contract of £ 19,44,000 with M/s JCJ Knott (with a capital of £100) for the supply of Rifles, deliveries to begin in 10 days of the contract and conclude in 120 days, given the state of ongoing turmoil in Kashmir. A week after the ceasefire, the order was cancelled since no delivery was made. Shri Menon also signed two contracts which remained unfulfilled, one for 25 Michell Bombers and another for Staghound Armored Cars. A mysterious character named EH Potter represented four of these firms. The final deal Shri EH Potter did with Mr Menon was for steel plates worth £400000 where as per the Ayyangar Committee, the margin for profit was £102,000. After much hue and cry, Ayyangar Sub-Committee investigated the case and came with the data mentioned above in its report submitted to Nehru on 9th April 1951. The Public Account Committee took the cognizance and advised formal investigation in the matter by Two High-Court Judges. On 18th December 1954, Government asked the Committee to reconsider its decision. When the PAC refused to agree, Government informed the committee on 30th September 1955, that the case was officially closed. On 3rd February 1956, Krishna Menon was brought into the Cabinet as a Minister without portfolio. Within an year, looking at his exemplary record (well, he was in England, all through the pre-independence era; was Local Guardian not only to Indira, but also to Feroze Gandhi who spent five-six years in London, to gain a degree, but could attend classes for three months during the period, eventually leaving with unfinished degree), Nehru appointed Menon as Defense Minister. Shri Menon presided over the humiliating defeat of India in 1962 was and now his statue stands next to President’s House, watching over benignly and majestically at the Sena Bhawan, the seat of Indian Army. While there are interesting stories around Teja Loan Scam and Mundhra Scam under Nehru, looking at Rahul Gandhi’s fascination with Defense deals, this was the most pertinent. This could possibly in a way explain how Rahul Gandhi is battling these personal demons in his own dynastic family, and as Nietzsche wrote that if one gazes into the abyss long enough, the abyss gazes at the person. I guess the abyss is gazing into Shri Rahul Gandhi. We have remained blind to the history of our corruption that we have almost accepted it as a way of Indian life and politics. We now look for the demons even when there are none. No one should be above scrutiny. But as a sincere opposition, Rahul Gandhi should bring facts instead of crying wolf every other day. It is not funny anymore. Right now, the man seems to be troubled by his own past, on some Quixotic adventure with his party colleagues and media playing the part of Sancho Panza.

147,K Bhattacharjee,"There has to be an alternative mechanism to determine an acceptable code of conduct for intelligence officers within the CIA and other agencies in moments of crisis. In a 90-page (Central Intelligence Agency) CIA report  that was made public recently, the agency has detailed its use of torture during interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11 terror attacks. Apart from techniques like waterboarding  and walling , the agency also mentions that it pondered over using drugs that could work as ‘truth serum’, thus forcing suspects to spill out information. The CIA’s torture techniques have attracted much criticism from human rights organisations. The American Civil Liberties Union has commented that the CIA has left behind a legacy of broken bones and tortured minds. “Just like the government lawyers who tried to give unlawful torture a veneer of legality, the secret history reveals that CIA doctors were indispensable to the effort of legitimising the program,” said  ACLU attorney Dror Ladin. “Perhaps the most striking element of the document is the CIA doctors’ willful blindness to the truth of what they were doing.” It is rather unsurprising that human rights organisations are up in arms against the CIA for its torture techniques. However, they conveniently ignore the context of their actions. The CIA is obviously not a beacon of honesty and their conduct is not something anyone should emulate, given their history of gross human rights violations and toppling governments to install a US-puppet in its place. However, in this particular instance, it is important to understand the context in which they operated. The intelligence agencies had received a lot of flak for their massive failure to prevent the attacks at the Twin Towers. Hundreds and thousands of lives were murdered that day and it surely weighed heavy on their conscience. Therefore, they had the responsibility to ensure that such a tragedy was never repeated ever again and it is only natural that they were prepared to go to any extent to ensure that. Before condemning the CIA for employing torture techniques, there are certain dilemmas we need to ponder over. Whose right to life should matter more for intelligence and law enforcement agencies? That of Jihadis or their own countrymen? Torturing terror suspects in return for potential information that could prevent further terror attacks, is it a fair deal? Do terrorists even have ‘human rights’? Do we really want to tie the hands of the intelligence agencies which could then lead to terrorist attacks that could have been otherwise prevented? These are complicated questions and their answers are not always black or white. The absolutist stand that human rights organisations tend to adopt in such matters is quite unhelpful. “Torture of terror suspects is bad and should be illegal!” Yes, it is undesirable, we know that and in an ideal world, it should attract the harshest of punishments. But we are not living in an ideal world and harsh circumstances call for harsh measures. The officers who participated in the torture carried the immense burden of protection of innocent lives in their hands. Do we punish people for crossing the line in pursuit of ensuring the safety of innocent civilians? There are genuine concerns over legitimising torture of course which is often lost during absolutist stands. Legitimising torture could very well lead to the government’s persecution of critics and those it perceives to be political enemies. It could also lead to the persecution of innocent civilians. More importantly, should any government have the power to torture people into submission? These are all very serious concerns which cannot be brushed aside. US intelligence agencies have certainly proved time and again that ethical corruption runs rampant in these institutions. Therefore, a national debate is imperative in this regard, preferably without beginning from absolutist positions. The United States of America is a beast in its own right. Their forces have committed a range of atrocities all across the globe. But one thing it does very well is to protect its own interests. Human rights organisations, like the ACLU here, for instance, are coming across as extremely hypocritical. Torture techniques are something that bothers the ACLU quite a lot. The organisation has said in light of the CIA report that is important to seek the release of more documents relating to the matter as President Donald Trump during his campaign had stated that he planned to legalise certain methods of torture. And yet, the same organisations support Hillary Clinton who championed U.S. military intervention in Libya that threw the region into chaos. There is certain duplicity at work here. These organisations seem to accord disproportionate attention to the torture of terror suspects, a very limited number of people, and support politicians that destabilise an entire region and plunge it into chaos. In all honesty, it’s not just the US which has a terrible human rights record. Every country embraces cruelty in some form or another, only to varying degrees. All Islamic countries, many African countries and China above all have terrible human rights record as well. Since the US is the greatest superpower on Earth at the moment, it’s only natural that their greed and selfishness lead to correspondingly more devastating consequences. The US has destabilised the entire Middle East to satisfy its own greed, China has millions in concentration camps. My larger point is, in the grand scheme of things, the torture of terror suspects post 9/11 is a speck of dust when compared to the conduct of the US in the middle east. It is an open secret that they armed Jihadis in a bid to overthrow the Assad in Syria. If Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and other senior officials in the erstwhile administration are not prosecuted for the ‘human rights violations’ they have committed by aiding and abetting Jihadis, what good will it serve by punishing those who employed controversial techniques to prevent terror attacks? In the case of the latter, the intentions appear to be honest. The same cannot be said of the former. Remarkably, human rights organisations remain tight-lipped about powerful Democrats whose policies have felicitated the rise of slavery in Libya in the second decade of the 21st century. There is another aspect to the matter as well. Civilisations are built over blood and bones, not fancy claims to abstract concepts such as human rights. It has been the case for the entire duration of human civilisation and it continues to be so. The only reason the US and China can get away with it is that they have the power to do so without any consequences. As I have said before in a previous article , contrary to claims that China will regret its treatment of Uighur Muslims, if the country has to suffer, it will be due to a confrontation with the US for power and domination. In the same manner that Adolf Hitler met his end due to the War that began as a consequence of his imperial ambitions, not due to him committing a genocide. India gets far more stick than any other country for crimes that it hasn’t even committed. Liberals in India go on and on about the ‘colonial’ nature of the Indian state and how the Indian Army is treating Kashmiri separatists in a very cruel manner deserving of condemnation. The truth of the matter is, India has been treating Kashmiri separatists with kids gloves. No other country will tolerate terrorist sympathisers pelting stones at security forces to help terrorists get away. Despite such benevolent treatment, India receives far more condemnation for defending our own territory against external and internal threats than others do for committing acts of aggression. The message on the wall is clear. Power matters and might is right in the domain of international politics. Coming back to the CIA, there needs to be greater accountability and intelligence agencies need to be subject to intense scrutiny. The CIA has done itself no favours given its dubious track record. At the same time, I do not believe human rights organisations have the right people to judge the actions of those who have to make choices that could result in life and death. There has to be an alternative mechanism to determine an acceptable code of conduct for intelligence officers in moments of crisis and it has to come from the legislative and executive branches of the government and not from advocates of a pseudo-religion.",2018-11-16,"China,cia,Human Rights,left liberals,USA",CIA torture report: Times of crisis and the grey areas of acceptable conduct,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/cia-torture-report-times-of-crisis-and-the-grey-areas-of-acceptable-conduct/

149,Abhishek Banerjee,"Even if the Congress gets somewhere near power in 2019, remember that they will necessarily have to share that power with people of … let us say …  “diverse backgrounds”.  This appeared on Firstpost yesterday, inside yet another article authored by some Nehruvian elitist. Apparently, the level of parliamentary debate in India got worse in the 1960s. Why? Because “democracy deepened” in India, which apparently allowed people of “diverse backgrounds” to get elected. Not just those who were born to rich parents spent their lives schmoozing with British high society and then parked themselves in top positions once the British left. What is shocking is that a mainstream outlet like Firstpost allowed such a ‘racist’ view to be published. One has to wonder how this managed to pass muster at the editorial desk. Did the ‘racism’ in these words somehow become more palatable simply because it was expressed in English? I don’t think that a British media outlet today would allow something like this to go on their website! Complaining that the quality of debates got worse because democracy in India deepened and people of “diverse backgrounds” were elected? But the Nehruvian intellectual class in India somehow still manages to deal in this kind of old world ‘racist’ rhetoric. Except, it is not even racism in a strictly technical sense. Presumably, most of the Nehruvians are of the same race as the rest of us. This is one group of brown Indians expressing prejudice against other brown Indians because we don’t have privilege handed down to us by white masters of yesteryear. Seriously, that’s messed up. And vile. And just pathetic. If I had to describe the Nehruvian elite, I would say they are not even racist! They are worse. The modern world is becoming a more integrated place every day. More and more voices are being heard and from all kinds of diverse backgrounds. And like racists anywhere, the Nehruvian elite is frustrated and angry. What should I call them? Copycat racists, perhaps? You tell me! And the frustrated Nehruvian elite is watching the world pass them by. This elite maintained a tight grip on the nation during the first four decades after independence. But the floodgates opened in 1991. The liberation that began in 1991 is heading towards a logical conclusion. The Nehruvian elite can feel their rising irrelevance; they can feel the nation slipping through their fingers. So the frustrated Nehruvian elite hits out at the modern world with a deep bitterness. They seek emotional safety by talking about how great and powerful their ancestors used to be 70 years ago. Take Shashi Tharoor’s recent remark that a ‘chaiwala’ could become Prime Minister simply because of Nehru. That’s the typical zamindar mentality of the Congress, appropriating for themselves the credit for what other people have achieved through hard work. No wonder Shashi Tharoor was mocked and brutally so. Shashi Tharoor, you are wrong. Whatever Rahul Gandhi has today is because of Nehru. Leave Modi alone. He made his own path. We need to understand that the Nehruvian elite is threatened by genuine merit and has an actively hostile attitude towards those who work hard to make something of themselves. Bear in mind that Rahul Gandhi is hardly the first member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to become Congress President by taking over the reins from a mother or father. Jawaharlal Nehru himself became Congress President for the first time in 1929, taking over from Motilal Nehru who was the sitting Congress President at the time. This chain nepotism has since seeped into India’s national consciousness and permeated all fields from business to cinema. If there is anything wrong with India, it is not the deepening of democracy. Rather it is the cementing of the culture of the dynasty. The opportunity cost that the culture of the dynasty has imposed on our nation is immense. We have the second largest pool of human talent in the world. Why the huge mismatch between resources and outcomes? An answer is a small group of dynastic elites and their sycophants perched at the top, forming a permanent bottleneck. Even if the Congress gets somewhere near power in 2019, remember that they will necessarily have to share that power with people of … let us say …  “diverse backgrounds”. And the Congress might even have to stay in the background itself, propping up one of those people from “diverse backgrounds” as Prime Minister.

153,OpIndia Staff,"Activists and analysts have pointed out the irony of the socialist Chinese government, led by the theoretically pro-worker Communist Party, cracking down on young Marxists At least 10 young activists from elite universities have gone missing  in China on Sunday, after taking part in a national campaign for workers’ rights. This appears  to be the result of an effort by the government to silence one of the most visible student protests in years. Around nine young Chinese labour advocates have been forcibly detained in major cities across the country since August. Unidentified men in at least five Chinese cities rounded up the activists. The men beat several activists before pushing them into cars and driving away. One activist, Zhang Shengye, was ‘kidnapped’ from the campus of Peking University, one of China’s top universities. However, it was not immediately clear what had happened to the activists who went missing in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wuhan. “They hit him hard and quickly got Zhang under control,” one witness told AFP, requesting anonymity. The activists, describe themselves as ardent communists. Fervent believers in the ideals of Marx and Mao, they have waged an unusual campaign against inequality and corporate greed. This has gained traction at some of China’s top schools. These activists have become a growing problem for the government in recent years. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has increasingly  cracked down on all forms of dissent, including human rights activists, labour groups and religious organizations. Activists and analysts have pointed out the irony of the socialist Chinese government, led by the theoretically pro-worker Communist Party, cracking down  on young Marxists. “It’s ironic to see how the students who have been studying and believing in Marxism are rounded up by the Chinese authorities for supporting workers, the fundamental value of Marxism,” said Patrick Poon. He is a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “The students are simply exercising their freedom of expression and showing their solidarity to the workers. They should be immediately released”, he said. In August, 50 student activists went missing  after police raided an apartment where they were staying. Students from Renmin University in Beijing and Nanjing University have also disappeared or been held under house arrest. Three worker activists investigating conditions in a factory making shoes for Ivanka Trump’s brand were separately  detained in May. The Jasic Workers Solidarity group said at least two members of an NGO supporting workers in Shenzhen were detained. Along with them, three members of the solidarity group were also detained in the crackdown.

What prompted this bizarre decision was when Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview with MSNBC subtly criticized Facebook   for being a service that traffics “in your personal life.” Cook was asked that what he would do if he were in Zuckerberg’s shoes dealing with the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He dismissed the question by saying, “I wouldn’t be in this situation.” Zuckerberg soon after retorted in an interview with  that he found Cook’s comments to be “extremely glib.” According to a report  by the New York Times, Cook’s comments angered Zuckerberg. He later ordered his management to only use Android phones. He argued that the Android mobile operating system had a wider user base compared with Apple’s. The report had given a detailed account of what went inside Facebook following the Russian interference. It further spoke about the company’s subsequent handling of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. Facebook’s offence against Apple didn’t stop right there. According to NYT, the company also promoted negative articles about Apple on a conservative news site called the NTK Network. In a massive controversy which broke out in April this year, the social media giant, Facebook had stated  that the personal data of nearly 87 million users may have been ‘improperly shared’ with political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had accepted the blame for the data breach. Cambridge Analytica, a UK based firm with which the data was allegedly shared, had also been amidst a large global scandal. News broke that it had used millions of Facebook users’ personal information for targeted political campaigns. CA had managed US President Donald Trump’s campaign. In India, Indian National Congress was also reportedly one of its clients. The Congress party had been in a denial mode  over its alleged hiring of CA and the allegations of using voter’s personal data  to expose social and demographical fault lines to strategise its poll campaign. But several shreds of evidence  had emerged showing that it had been in business with the firm. Prominent Congress supporter turned rebel, Shehzad Poonawalla had also revealed  what he claimed was a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to the Congress party for bagging it as one of its clients.

OpIndia got in touch with the author to understand  the specifics of the controversy. Failing to protect user data, Facebook was severely criticised worldwide. The Government of India has sent a notice  to Facebook to provide details on the data of Indian users leaked to CA and whether the data might have been used to manipulate the electoral process.

155,OpIndia Staff,"Congress government and activists were demanding the removal of existing CEO Shashank The Election Commission has appointed  IAS officer Ashish Kundra as the new Chief Election Officer of Mizoram replacing S B Shashank. “The Election Commission of India in consultation with the Government of Mizoram hereby nominates Ashish Kundra as the chief electoral officer for the state of Mizoram with immediate effect,” a notification  issued by the Election Commission stated. The decision was taken by the Election Commission following protests  by the local political groups and NGOs demanding the ouster of S B Shashank from the post of CEO. Shashank had complained to the Election Commission about principal secretary-level officer, Lalnunmawia Chuaungo’s interference with the election process. The Election Commission had thereafter removed Chuaungo. Protesters took to streets following the removal of Chuaungo and picketed in front of Shashank’s office for two days. The agitation was called off  after Shashank left for Delhi as he was summoned  by the Election Commission. The whole problem relates to the voting rights of Bru people who had escaped from Mizoram following large-scale violence against them in 1997. These Bru people are currently lodged in refugee camps in neighbouring Tripura. They are still voters in Mizoram. Past efforts by the Election Commission to provide them with facilities to vote were opposed by Mizo organisations and the Congress government.

157,Nirwa Mehta,"Shashi Tharoor's remark is just the reflection of deep-rooted casteist, elitist mindset Congress nurtures while masquerading as a socialist, liberal political party.  Congress leaders have time and again taken digs at the humble beginnings of Prime Minister Modi. It all started five years back when Mani Shankar Aiyar in January 2014, just a few months before the country voted in 2014 general elections, said , “Modi can never become PM, can sell tea.” The then BJP’s prime ministerial candidate took this opportunity to make it part of his campaign with widely popular ‘Chai Pe Charcha’, where he held talks and connected with citizens over chai. Aiyar was left to gulp down his words, as a few months later, not only did Modi become the prime minister, he did so with a thumping majority. But the elitist comments from Congress didn’t stop. In fact, Mani Shankar Aiyar himself upped his game and during the run-up to Gujarat Assembly elections last year, he called PM Modi ‘ neech’, a lowly, casteist slur. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad too has made a casteist statement on PM Modi by referring  to him as ‘Gangu Teli’ (Modi belongs to the Teli caste). Congress leader Jairam Ramesh referred  to PM Modi as ‘Bhasmasur’, a mythological demon, during the 2014 elections. Not to be left too behind, Congress President Rahul Gandhi himself had once referred to PM Modi as ‘khoon ka dalal ‘ after the surgical strikes. Yesterday, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor  commented that it is because of Jawaharlal Nehru, the patriarch of the entitled dynasty  that has believed India is their family business, that a ‘chaiwala’ has become a prime minister. Amusingly, Tharoor’s remark comes just months after another senior Congress leader and a staunch Nehru-Gandhi family loyalist Mallikarjun Kharge had said that a ‘chaiwala’ could become a prime minister only because Congress ‘preserved democracy’. This comes from a party which out of 71 odd years of Indian independence has been in power for 55 years. Of these 55 years, someone from The Family was the prime minister for 37 odd years. Narendra Modi winning elections with a thumping victory in 2014 was a proverbial slap on the collective faces of the slaves of the dynasty. A man from humble beginnings, with no fortune to spend, no surname to back, has become the prime minister and the elitist Congress leaders cannot digest it. Shashi Tharoor’s remark is just the reflection of deep-rooted casteist, elitist mindset Congress nurtures while masquerading as a socialist, liberal political party. So, no, Shashi Tharoor. It is not because of Nehru that a ‘chaiwala’ has become a Prime Minister of India. It is despite Nehru and his progeny that have believed themselves, heirs of the coveted chair, that he has become the Prime Minister of India. As an aside, the timing of Tharoor’s comment about the Prime Minister being a ‘chaiwala’ is eerily similar to Aiyar’s comment.

As per reports , the review petitions rely primarily on the dissenting judgment of Justice Indu Malhotra. The only women judge in the bench had said that constitutional parameters of rationalist cannot apply to matters of faith. The petitioners also argue that the Supreme Court entertained the PIL without considering the locus standi of the petitioner. The review petitions also assert that no women devotee of Lord Ayyappa would want to visit Sabarimala. They also said that the tradition is based on the “Naishtika Brahmachari” character of the deity.

159,Ananth Krishna,"The ‘magic of democracy’ has, in a certain sense, made him accountable. He cannot adopt a stance that so plainly would cost him significant votes. But then again, Tharoor is a ‘guiding light’ for many liberals and he is the intellectual face of the Congress. The controversy surrounding the entry of young women in Sabarimala has apparently ‘torn’ the hearts of ‘instinctive liberals’ such as Shashi Tharoor. On closer examination though, his so-called conflict of this self-proclaimed ‘liberal’ Hindu is just the subterfuge because he (Tharoor) knows the electoral math. As has been written earlier, Sabarimala has resulted in an awakening of Hindus in Kerala. They have united across caste and class lines to demonstrate against the verdict and the undue haste of the Communist Government in the state to implement the verdict. It is this reality that has upset the calculation of every political dispensation in the state. All of them understood the political repercussions of such a widespread indignation with the Supreme Court verdict. The BJP and Congress in the state both initially welcomed the judgement. They only decided to backpedal when it was clear that public opinion lay on the other side, and that they can make political gains by exploiting it. Congress hailed the verdict as progressive , only to go back on its words later. BJP state leaders have in the past called  for the entry of women into the temple. The ideological parent of the BJP, RSS has supported  the entry of women into the shrine for a long time. It was assumed by everyone that Malayalis Hindus would go gentle into that good night – but we did not. And that has shocked more than a few of our great journalists, commentators and historians. Tharoor was himself a proponent of desecrating the shrine. In 2016, he told  reporters that he was personally for entry, “because traditions evolve”. He had posted some tweets as well, explaining his stand on the issue: Two years later, it seems that traditions no longer can evolve, that it is no longer ‘discrimination’, all because of electoral realities. Just a few days after the verdict, Tharoor had welcomed  the verdict. Now, he has also retracted, like others. And the answer lies squarely in the fact that his electoral prospects are endangered. Tharoor, whether he or others like it or not, as a Lok Sabha member, directly accountable to the people of his constituency. As such, his positions on issues have to be amenable to the opinion of those in his constituency. In 2014, he won his constituency with an uncomfortable margin of 15,000 votes, or only ~2% of the votes against O Rajagopal of the BJP. In 2019 BJP is sure to have made even more inroads into his constituency. The gains BJP made, especially with the Hindu Community, would have grown with them adopting a harsher stand than the Congress on Sabarimala. This is why Tharoor had to backpedal and call for the wishes of devotees to be respected. The ‘magic of democracy’ has, in a certain sense, made him accountable. He cannot adopt a stance that so plainly would cost him significant votes. But then again, Tharoor is a ‘guiding light’ for many liberals and he is the intellectual face of the Congress. As such, he cannot abandon this support base either. How these ‘liberals’ and ‘constitutionalists’ can support a Supreme Court judgement that surely violates religious liberty is a whole another matter that ought to be dealt with later. Tharoor the politician and Tharoor the intellectual are in conflict over this issue, and there is no way to resolve it, no reconciliation possible. Tharoor, therefore, tries in vain to please both through his piece  in  Self-proclaimed intellectuals like Ramachandra Guha  can look down upon the unwashed masses of Kerala and pontificate about ‘constitutional morality’ and ‘equality’ and whatnot while garnering applause from ‘secular-liberal’ Twitter. Tharoor cannot, for he and his party are aware of ground reality. Much of Tharoor’s piece is an attempt to flog the horse of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee as the fulcrum of ‘secular’ and ‘non-communal’ resistance against Pinrayi Vijayan and the designs of the state government. He flags the BJP’s position as an attempt to gain the most from the polarization resulting from the continuing deadlock over the Hill Shrine. But he conveniently forgets that his own party changed gears to ensure that they do not miss out on an opportunity to gain political capital themselves. He, of course, has ignored his own hypocrisy in changing position on Sabarimala. An irony in Tharoor’s piece is that he seems to think that the “seemingly unchallengeable principles” of constitutionalism and democracy are conflicting with one another. While this conflict by itself is legitimate in the larger sense, he like many others, seems to misunderstand what exactly ‘constitutionalism’ and ‘liberalism’ entitles. The concept of religious liberty, something that is core not only to constitutional rights and to liberalism generally, are conveniently ignored. Constitutional rights are not meant to circumscribe practices such as those in Sabarimala, which squarely fall within the realm of the religious practice. Indian ‘liberals’ have somehow defined this case as one of ‘equality’ and ‘discrimination’ when it is, in fact, a question of religious liberty. The Supreme Court has indeed effectively ruled  that the Constitutional guaranteed under Article 25 & 26 are null. Politicians are, at the end of day, guided by electoral considerations. One cannot expect principled positions from them, especially when public opinion is blowing so strongly in one direction. Tharoor, however, tries to wash away his duplicity. In Malayalam, the result of his two-timing of the electorate and his supporters can be described in a proverb: “രണ്ടു തോണിയിൽ കാലിട്ടുനിന്നാൽ നടുകടലിൽ കാണാം”. “If you put your leg in two boats, you will end up in the middle of the sea”. Come May 2019 and that may very well be the position Tharoor finds himself in.",2018-11-13,"2019 elections,Congress,hindu,Kerala,Kerala politics,Sabarimala,Shashi Tharoor","No, Shashi Tharoor, it is not the Sabarimala verdict, but electoral gains that has left you torn",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/shashi-tharoor-sabarimala-verdict-elections/
160,Raju Das,"The affidavit filed by the government of India does not say IAF was not consulted and Reliance got ₹30000 crore in the deal to buy 36 Rafale jets, as Rahul Gandhi claims Continuing with his policy of spreading lies about the Rafale deal, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has gone ahead and has lied about a publicly available document. In a tweet posted today, he has said that Modi has accepted that he stole in the Rafale deal in the affidavit  filed with the Supreme Court giving detail of decision-making process in the Rafale deal. He also wrote that govt has accepted in the affidavit that they changed the contract without consulting Indian Air Force and put ₹30,000 crore in the pocket of Ambani. We are not sure whether the Congress President has read the affidavit or not, but we can tell that the affidavit does not mention anything that Rahul Gandhi has tweeted. There was no question of not consulting the air force. The Indian Air Force was completely involved in the entire bidding process for 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) that India planned to buy during the UPA rule. Many people don’t realise that the deal to buy 36 Rafale jets is not different from the original deal to buy 126 jets. It is just an extension of the original deal. If it was a separate standalone deal, it had to start from the beginning. In 2007, UPA government invited bids to buy 126 fighter jets, as per the requirement of IAF. There were six bidders in the deal, and Dassault had emerged as the winner in 2012 after a long process. The Indian Air force was an integral part of this entire process. The UPA government did not select Rafale on its own, IAF did the evaluation of the contender planes and selected Rafale. The original bid was to buy 18 Rafale planes directly from Dassault, while the rest 108 was to be made in India by HAL. Both the components of the deal were different. As there were differences over the planes that were to be made by HAL, the deal could not be finalised. While the deal remained stalled for 3 years, the urgency of new jets for IAF was increasing. The number of fighter planes belonging to IAF was decreasing due to crashes and retirements. At the same time, India’s enemy nations were adding fighters at a rapid pace. Due to this reason, the Modi government decided to go ahead with the direct purchase of Rafale jets from Dassault as per the original deal, while dropping the HAL made part of the deal. Only change the government made was double the size of this order from the original 18 jets to 36, which equals 2 squadrons for IAF. The IAF was waiting for 126 jets, which was not coming, now they are at least getting 36 jets. The IAF had already selected the Rafale jet, so there was no question of not consulting them in selecting the planes for buying. The affidavit filed by the government says the Defence Procurement Policy of 2013 was followed in every step of the decision-making process. The 36 planes were ordered as per the process already completed during the earlier bid for 126 jets. The top decision-making body in DPP is the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC). DAC includes the chief of staff of the Air Force, along with other two service chiefs and top bureaucrats in the Defence Ministry. The affidavit also informs that the negotiation for the 36 jets was then done by an Indian Negotiation Team (INT). INT was headed by the Deputy Chief of Air Staff. This means the air force was deeply involved in the discussion for the deal, contrary to Rahul Gandhi’s allegation. As informed by Dassault CEO, India secured a discount  of 9% for the 36 jets compared to the price India was paying for the direct purchase of 18 jets in the original deal. Despite being refuted innumerable times, Rahul Gandhi still repeats the lie that Modi has given ₹30,000 to Anil Ambani. No, the affidavit filed by the government of India does not make any such statement. In fact, the affidavit says that there are 35 vendors in the deal with offset obligations. This includes two main vendors, Dassault and weaponry supplier MBDA, and their 21 and 12 tier-I sub-vendors respectively. The affidavit also clearly mentions that the share of Dassault Aviation in total offset is 19.9% only. This means, even if entire offset obligation of Dassault goes to Reliance, that would be less than ₹6,000 crore, not ₹30,000 crore. But Dassault has not given its entire business to Reliance, it has set up a 49:51 joint venture with Reliance, where the total investment  will be ₹800 crore, 49% of which will be invested by Dassault and rest 51% to be put by Reliance. This means Reliance is not getting any money in their pocket from Dassault. Dassault will be investing around ₹400 crore in the JV, and Reliance will have to invest a similar amount.

162,OpIndia Staff,"The Delhi High Court had rejected Rahul and Sonia's plea challenging the I-T notice in connection with the National Herald Case. The Supreme court Tuesday finalized  December 4 for final arguments on petitions filed by Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. They had challenged the Delhi High Court order refusing to give them relief in a case of re-opening of their tax assessments for 2011-12. A bench of justice A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer is slated  to hear Rahul, Sonia, and Oscar Fernandes’ appeal. The appeal challenges the September 10 verdict of the high court. A council had represented  the Income Tax department. Because of this, the apex court did not issue any notice on their petitions. The I-T department had filed a caveat in the apex court. It said that it should be heard in case an appeal is filed against the high court order. A caveat is a legal procedure. An application can be filed through it, by any party to the litigation to pre-empt an ex-parte order. After a brief hearing, the bench said , “Since respondent (Income Tax department) has put in an appearance, we are not issuing a formal notice. However, we are fixing the matter for final arguments on December 4”. The Delhi High Court in September had rejected  Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi’s plea challenging the I-T notice seeking tax reassessment for the financial year 2011-2012 in connection  with the National Herald Case . Earlier in August, Rahul Gandhi had appeared in the Delhi High Court and challenged, after the I-T department accused  him of concealing his income in the years 2011-2012. The department had considered reopening Rahul’s case. This was because he did not disclose his directorship in Young Indian Pvt Ltd (YI) since 2010. The same day, Sonia Gandhi and Oscar Fernandes, too, had moved  the Delhi High Court, challenging the reopening of their assessments by the Income-Tax regarding the Young Indian- National Herald transactions. The ‘tax file’ had then revealed that Rahul Gandhi had hidden from the Income-Tax department that he was a Director in Young India, which is the main company involved in the ‘National Herald case ’. He had allegedly hidden the facts from the I-T department. Therefore a whopping amount of Rs 154.97 crore couldn’t be assessed by them. The tax file also revealed that he was also the direct beneficiary of the funds directed at ‘Young India’. As the judiciary is tightening the strings, things are seeming to take unexpected turns for the Congress party bigwigs. The Gandhi’s seem to be getting jittery. Earlier too, we had reported how the Gandhis’ had tried to oppose the Income Tax’ investigation  into the National Herald case. Congress had also earlier reportedly threatened tax officials  with legal consequences for asking “irrelevant questions” during their investigations.

Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of CPI(M), on Tuesday rejected  the idea of projecting anyone as the Prime Minister in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Yechury was attending a meeting with DMK president M.K. Stalin at the latter’s Alwarpet residence in Chennai. Yechury addressed journalists after the meeting. Responding to a question about projecting Rahul Gandhi as the opposition’s Prime Ministerial candidate, Yechury said, “India is a Parliamentary democracy and not a Presidential form.” “Our Constitution is Parliamentary democracy and only elected members of Parliament can elect the Prime Minister. Not you and me,” he added. After discussing with Stalin the need to have a secular front, Yechury said, “more than the attitude of the leaders, it is people from the ground who will push all the leaders to come together to save India, and it will happen.” Responding to a query whether the CPI(M) would be part of an alliance in which the Congress and the Trinamool Congress were members, he said alliances in India would take place at the state level first. “Then, on that basis, the national alliance will emerge. In Tamil Nadu, we have decided that we will be with the DMK-led front in the forthcoming elections,” he said. Yechury is not the only one to reject the idea of projecting Rahul Gandhi as Prime Ministerial candidate.

164,OpIndia Staff,"The temple will open later this week for the pilgrimage session. The Kerala government is adamant on imposing the SC order. The Supreme Court today admitted the review petitions and set the date for hearing to January 22. Sabarimala is an ancient Sastha temple dedicated to Lord Ayappa. It is located in the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Western Ghat mountain ranges of Pathanamthitta District, Kerala. The temple is open to people belonging to all religions. The pilgrims are required to undertake a 41-day penance to visit the temple. In 1991, the temple’s custom of prohibiting the women of menstruating age was challenged before the Kerala High Court in filed . The custom was upheld by the court as constitutional and justified. In 2006, Indian Young Lawyers Association Article 14  a public interest litigation petition before the Supreme Court challenging the Sabarimala Temple’s custom of prohibiting women of menstruating from entering the temple. The Association argued that the custom violates the rights to equality under Article 25  and freedom of religion under  The case was finally referred to a Constitution bench comprising of former CJI Deepak Mishra, Justice R Bhanumathi and Justice Ashok Bhushan. On 28th September 2018, the Constitution Bench comprising of CJI Deepak Mishra, Justice Rhington Nariman, Justice Indu Malhotra, Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice D Y Chandrachud, delivered the judgment. The court by 4:1 majority ruled that Sabarimala’s exclusion of women violated the fundamental rights of women between the ages of 10-50 years and Rule 3(b) of the Public Worship Rules was unconstitutional. Justice Indu Malhotra, the sole lady judge in the bench, was the sole dissenting voice that stood for the traditions of the temple. She observed  that matters of deep religious sentiment should not be interfered with by the court. She said that the shrine and the deity are protected by Article 25 of the constitution and hence, the court should not interfere unless there is an aggrieved person from that religion or section. Justice Malhotra further observed that the subject of rationality should not be seen in religious beliefs and that there are clear attributes that there exists a section with identifiable characteristics, they constitute religious denomination. While the case was sub-judice, several women’s groups and NGOs had run a campaign named ‘Ready to wait’, signifying that the women devotees of Lord Ayappan are ready to reach the age of 50 so they can take the pilgrimage for darshan. The NGO People for Dharma , activists Anjali George, Padma Pillai and lawyer J Sai Deepak  have been crucial in uniting thousands of devotees and supporters around the world. Soon after the Supreme court decision in the case was delivered, protests erupted against the decision of the court. Men and women came out  on the streets protesting against the interference of the court in the traditions of the temple. A review has been filed  in the Supreme Court against the judgment by the Pandalam royal family, the Nair Service Society, the Tanthri or the chief priest of the Sabarimala temple and National Ayyappa Devotees Association. Despite being aware of the outrage among the devotees against the judgment, the Kerala Chief Minister refused  to file a review petition against the court order. He said that he will abide by the decision of the Apex Court and will provide facilities to devotees who wish to visit Sabarimala. The temple priests boycotted the talks called by the Kerala government. No female devotee of Lord Ayyappa tried to enter the shrine. Two women activists, Kavitha Jakkala (a journalist) and Rehana Fatima (a Muslim), none of whom was a devotee of Lord Ayyappa, tried  to enter the shrine amidst full police protection but they were met with resistance of the protesting devotees. Another woman, Mary Sweety, also returned midway as she was stopped by the protesters. The erstwhile royal family of Pandalam asked the head priest to close the doors of the shrine as two women headed for the temple under police protection. Meanwhile, the State Devaswom (religious trusts)  minister, Kadakampally Surendran, said that while people of all ages should be allowed to go there, it should not be made into a place where activists come and showcase their power. The BJP came out  strongly in support of Ayappa devotees with the BJP President Amit Shah assuring that the Karyakartas of the BJP will be standing beside the devotees of Lord Ayyappa like a rock in the battle to defend the tradition of Sabarimala. The Congress party which initially welcomed  the Supreme Court verdict, later on witnessing the mounting protests by the devotees, took a soft stand and said that while the SC verdict is welcome, traditions at religious places of worship must not be disturbed. Amidst the growing protests and the coldness of the Communist government towards the devotees, the former TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan started  the ‘no-donation campaign’ to mark protest over women’s entry in the temple. He urged the devotees to deposit paper pieces with the writing ‘Swami Saranam’ in the offering boxes instead of money. The Communist government crossing the limits of humanity lathicharged the peaceful protesters and arrested  thousands of them. Cases were registered  against hundreds of peaceful devotees. The Kerala High Court expressed  displeasure over the action of the Kerala government. The Kerala government had beefed  up the security at the shrine as the temple reopened on Nov 5 and 6 to ensure the safe entry of women in the temple. However, no woman of the restricted age group entered the temple. The Lord Ayyappa temple’s three-month-long pilgrim season is commencing from November 17 and the state government has reiterated that all devotees would be allowed to offer prayers at the shrine.

In Madhya Pradesh, too, swords were drawn between veteran Congress leader and former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijaya Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia over candidate selection. In poll-bound Rajasthan, as the suspected infighting between Ashok Gehlot camp versus Sachin Pilot camp leads  to delay in declaration of nomination list of candidates, two leaders from Congress have decided to have it their way. They have gone ahead and filed  their nomination papers without really waiting for the green signal from ‘high command’. Former Jaisalmer-Barmer Lok Sabha member Harish Chaudhary filed his nominations from Baytoo seat in Barmer. Congress leader Hemaram Chaudhary filed from Gudamalani seat from Barmer. Harish Chaudhary even  took out a road show followed by addressing a mass rally claiming his candidature from Congress party. Whereas Hemaram earlier served as revenue minister in the last Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. Speculations have been rife that the Rajasthan Congress is divided between the former Rajasthan chief minister and senior leader Ashok Gehlot and son of late Congress leader Rajesh Pilot, Sachin Pilot. However, Pilot had refuted  the claims as ‘rumours’ planted by the BJP. Both leaders are widely believed to be frontrunners in the race of yet to be announced the chief ministerial candidate for Congress. However, until now Congress has dodged the question. Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi had said that if Congress comes to power, either Gehlot or Pilot would be the chief minister in Rajasthan. Other names in the running were CP Joshi and Rameshwar Dudi, but Singhvi’s statement rules out their possibility. However, it is widely believed that Congress is not zeroing in on either of the two to avoid tensions within the party as a run-up to the elections.

In Madhya Pradesh, too, swords were drawn  between veteran Congress leader and former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijaya Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia over candidate selection.

166,Nirwa Mehta,"The Nehru-Gandhi family has not learnt to say no. Especially when it comes to being offered awards and prime-ministerships.  Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister, was born on 14th November 1889 in now restored Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. In 1951, after his initial ’embarrassment’ wore off , Nehru accepted that his birthday be celebrated as ‘Children’s’ Day’ in India, not because ‘he loved children’ as it is widely propagated, but because drawing inspiration from Queen Elizabeth II, whose birthday is celebrated as Flag Day to raise money for Save the Child Fund. So humble. So humble that back in 1955, when then President of India Dr Rajendra Prasad, who was also a Congress leader, before retiring from Congress party politics, conferred the Bharat Ratna , India’s highest civilian award, to Nehru, he did not say no. Dr Prasad had done so using his discretionary powers and without consulting the Cabinet. Nehru, instead of declining the honour while the Prime Minister from his own government, just accepted that he was awesome. And then he had his daughter, Indira Gandhi, work as his unofficial personal assistant during his time as the Prime Minister of India. Nehru served as Congress President in 1934-35 and from 1951 to 54. In 1959, Indira was made the AICC President. Soon, she moved to Nehru’s official residence to look after his affairs. Kind of like how Donald Trump has his daughter Ivanka helping him out. Speaking of which, the vanity sort of has had a trickle-down effect. After Nehru, his daughter India, too, believed she was awesome and invincible. Following her father’s death, she was elected as a Rajya Sabha MP and served in Lal Bahadur Shastri’s cabinet. After Shastri’s death, Indira was chosen as Prime Minister of India over Morarji Desai, and she did not say no. She, too, was awarded a Bharat Ratna while in office in 1971. She, too, did not say no to the award. And if we talk about Indira and vanity, could the Emergency be far behind? The victory over Pakistan in 1971, put Indira on the pedestal. But when economy floundered, the opposition increased. Smelling rebellion, Indira promptly imposed Emergency in the name of national security on 25th of June, 1975. And with Emergency, one is reminded of Sanjay Gandhi and how he almost ran the country in proxy along with his friends and the notorious sterilisation program? Level of narcissism was so high that Indira Gandhi’s son Sanjay Gandhi tried to burn down all copies of ‘Kissa Kursi Ka’ , a political satire film made on the Emergency. He was held guilty of the same and spent a month in Tihar and the film was finally released in 1978 after Congress lost the elections. After Sanjay Gandhi, who was widely believed to be Indira’s heir apparent (because dynasty trumps democracy) and was expected to succeed her and become India’s Prime Minister, died in a plane crash, the responsibility of taking over the country fell on Rajiv Gandhi’s shoulders. Rajiv, who was a commercial pilot by profession, also did not say no when he was asked by Congress members to contest from Amethi. When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards on 31st October 1984, her son, Rajiv, was asked to fill in her shoes. He, too, did not say no. A former pilot with about 3 years of experience as an MP, was made the prime minister, despite people much senior to him who could have easily filled in. As a newly elected prime minister, he presided over 1984 anti-Sikh riots which broke over the country following his mother’s assassination. After all, it was just the ground shaking after a big tree had fallen . No big deal. <sarcasm> Rajiv Gandhi was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously. Clearly, he could not have said no. His wife, Sonia, was offered to become the Congress President. Thankfully, that was perhaps the only time someone from The Family said no. Not sure what her answer would have been if Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister. Moving on, after staying away from active politics for a few years, Sonia was made Congress President in 1998, 7 years after her husband’s death. She had no prior experience, nor inclination (at least she claimed so), but this time, she did not say no. Within 62 days of becoming Congress’ primary member, she was the Party President. In 1999 she fought and won the Amethi seat, which was earlier held by her husband and her brother in law from the family. In 2004, she let the seat go in favour of her son Rahul Gandhi. I recently heard that people in Amethi are so far off from reality that they still think they are voting for Rajiv Gandhi. I’m not sure if it was a joke because, in India, it is very much possible. Sonia Gandhi is currently MP from Rae Bareilly and after almost 20 years as party president, she passed on the baton to her son, Rahul Gandhi in December 2017. Rahul Gandhi, who was then the party’s Vice President had led  his party to as many as 27 electoral defeats. Despite that, even Rahul Gandhi did not say no  to his promotion. Right from 1947 to now, out of over 70 long years, Congress has been in power for almost 55 years. Of these 55 years, The Family has been in power for as many as 37 years. Of course, one would feel vain and entitled. After all, in a democracy like India, Rahul Gandhi has batted for the dynasty  in the past. And going by the precedent set by the royal bloodline, perhaps Rahul Gandhi will offer his own nomination for Bharat Ratna for not having made it to the top post.",2018-11-14,"Bharat Ratna,Congress,Indira Gandhi,Jawaharlal Nehru,Nehru-Gandhi dynasty,Nehru-Gandhi family,Nepotism,Prime Minister,rahul gandhi,rajiv gandhi,sonia gandhi","Jawaharlal Nehru was so humble, he didn’t give Bharat Ratna to himself, just accepted that he was awesome",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/jawaharlal-nehru-was-so-humble-he-didnt-give-bharat-ratna-to-himself-just-accepted-that-he-was-awesome/
167,K Bhattacharjee,"Behind their garb of moral superiority lie a desire to control others and accumulate power. In recent times, their mask has been coming off with remarkable frequency. The vile behaviour of the Irish lady is only the latest is a long list of misconduct by liberals. A video  went viral on social media yesterday which showed an Irish lady abusing the Air India crew in vile language because they refused her extra wine. In the video, the lady could be heard saying that she is an international criminal lawyer and has been working for the human rights of Palestinians and Rohingyas. The sheer entitlement that the lady exhibits has become a hallmark of liberal behaviour in western countries. Liberals in the West appear to live under the delusion that they are entitled to certain privileges and deferential treatment by everyone around them. The lady clearly believes that she is entitled to extra wine merely because she is a proponent of the liberal worldview. It’s not the first time that a liberal has embarrassed herself in a flight. Earlier this year, a Swedish student created a ruckus  inside a flight to prevent the deportation of an Afghan asylum seeker. It might appear crazy but the person whose deportation she was trying to prevent had a criminal record. He had been convicted  and spent time in jail. Despite pleas by the airline staff to sit down and obvious disgruntlement of fellow passengers, she continued the ruckus and broadcast it on social media via Facebook Live. She is set to be prosecuted under “for crimes against the aviation law”. On another occasion, activists prevented the deportation of an asylum seeker on an Australian flight. “I just sat down and made it look like nothing was happening and once the last passenger was on and ready to go I stood up and told the air hostess that I wouldn’t sit down or leave until Puvaneethan was taken off the plane,” Ms Pilbrow, a 21-year-old activist, said . There are numerous other such incidents. All of this only goes on to show that liberals have complete disregard for law and the convenience and comfort of those around them. Worst of all, they get cheered and receive pats on the back for causing entirely avoidable harassment to those around them. As the Irish lady proved quite clearly, liberals perceive themselves to be above conventional norms of manners and etiquette. In their world, they are heroes before whom the plebs are meant to shower adulation. Those around them exist solely for the purpose of their gratification. the humanitarian concerns of liberals are not motivated by the benevolent aspects of human nature but are borne out of darker aspirations such as the will to power and a desire for glory. Liberals harbour a particular grudge towards those performing their duty in an orderly fashion. Perhaps, it is because they have an innate affinity towards chaos or disrupting ‘tyranny’ earns them special brownie points among their brethren. If achieving glory wasn’t the primary objective, then why did the Swedish student broadcast her ‘protest’ via Facebook Live? Across the world, liberals believe they can abandon common decency and treat those around them they disagree with in the most egregious manner because they have somehow earned that right. The Irish lady believed she had earned the right to have extra wine served to her because she had helped Palestinians and Rohingyas. The Swedish lady believed she had earned the right to harass her co-passengers because it was for the ‘greater good’. But what is the greater good served here really? That a convicted criminal’s deportation was delayed? That a liberal earned herself the right to feel great about herself at the expense of security for others? These are, surprisingly enough, only minor transgressions liberals have indulged themselves in because of their false sense of superiority and moral righteousness. They have, in the past, much like Jihadis, attacked trump supporters because of differences in political opinion. They have shut down conservative speakers in University campuses. In India, they seek to desecrate the faith of hundreds and thousands of people. They whitewash the crimes of tyrants to score political victories against the NDA government. Journalists even try to hide their alleged financial crimes  under the garb of threats to freedom of expression. This is nothing short of a disgrace.

He said that in his position as a CEO, he does not need to lie. Trappier was responding to Rahul Gandhi’s accusations that Trappier was covering up for favouritism carried by Narendra Modi government towards Anil Ambani-led Reliance group. Gandhi had accused Trappier of lying that he was forced to invest Rs. 284 crore in Anil Ambani promoted the loss-making company to procure land in Nagpur. Speaking to ANI, Trappier said that Dassault had prior experience of dealing with Congress. He also said that these statements by Congress President Rahul Gandhi made him sad. He added that Dassault’s first deal with India was in 1953 when Rahul Gandhi’s great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was PM. He added that they work with India, not with a particular political party. “We are supplying strategic products like fighters to the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Government. That is what is most important,” Trappier told to ANI. On pricing issue, Trappier said that the present aircrafts are cheaper by 9%. “Price of 36 was exactly the same when you compare with 18 flyaway. 36 is double of 18. So, as far as I am concerned, it should have been double the price. But because it was government to government, there was some negotiation and I had to reduce the price by 9%,” Trappier explained. He added that the price of Rafale in flyaway condition is less expensive in the 36 jets contract than the 126 jets contract. Speaking on the initial agreement with India’s state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), he said that had the initial deal (under the UPA) went through, he would not have had issues working with HAL and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance. However, since the deal didn’t go through the government of India had to reconfigure the urgently acquire 36 jets from Rafale. In the last few days, HAL said they were not interested in being part of the offset, said Trappier. “So it has been done by my decision and the decision of Reliance to invest in a new private company,” he said. Trappier clarified why Reliance, which has no prior experience was being chosen as an offset partner. He also said that Reliance is not getting the money directly. Dassault is a part of the Joint Venture in which they are putting the money. “I put my know-how free of charge on how to produce people. I have engineers and workers from Dassault who are taking the lead as far as the industrial part of the deal is concerned. At the same time, I have an Indian company like Reliance who is putting money into this joint venture as they want to develop the country. So the company is going to know how to produce aircraft,” he said. He explained Dassault held discussions with many corporates for offset tie-ups. “We could have gone to Tata or other family groups. At that time, the decision to go ahead was not with Dassault. We were in 2011, Tata was also discussing with other flying companies. We finally decided to go with Reliance as they have experience in big engineering facilities,” Trappier added.

171,Nupur J Sharma,"Santosh criticised Tipu extensively for his extremist views and actions. He also spoke about how there are some people who still suffer because of his atrocities. He also spoke about the Mandyam Iyengar Brahmins. The Karnataka government celebrated Tipu Jayanti  with substantial fanfare on the 10th of November 2018 with the BJP protesting  and Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy giving the celebrations a miss . At the helm of the celebrations was the Congress party. Reportedly, Congress leaders were not too happy  with HD Kumaraswamy giving the celebrations a miss and construed it as an insult. With Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy giving Tipu Jayanti a miss, many wondered if he was attempting to take a more neutral stance on the issue since Tipu Sultan is widely criticised for atrocities he heaped on Hindus. However, Santhosh Thammayya, a journalist with paper Hosa Digantha was arrested on 13th November 2018 around midnight for making an anti-Tipu speech. Karnataka police arrested Santosh after his speech which criticised Tipu Sultan, our sources have confirmed. Santosh flew to Coorg and delivered a speech in Gonikoppa on Tipu Sultan. Other than Santosh Thimmayya, 4 others were also present, according to our sources. Santosh criticised Tipu extensively for his extremist views and actions. He also spoke about how there are some people who still suffer because of his atrocities. He spoke about the Mandyam Iyengar Brahmins. Santosh said they don’t celebrate Diwali because Tipu Sultan killed hundreds of people from their community on Naraka Chaturdashi. Santosh also drew heavily from Sandeep Balakrishna’s book on Tipu Sultan. According to our sources, some Muslim members from the area did hold a press conference condemning Santosh for his speech. They also asserted that they will be holding a protest. Karnataka police filed an FIR against the journalist after this. The police called the journalist on 11th November to collect a copy of the FIR. Santosh said that he would be able to pick the FIR copy up soon since he was not in town. Karnataka police then proceeded to make the arrest on 13th November midnight. Karnataka Police lodged an FIR in GoNikoppa police station. GoNikoppa is in Vijarajpet taluk in Coorg district. With a journalist being arrested for his anti-Tipu speech, the Karnataka CM missing the Tipu Jayanti celebration and Congress taking offence, the Congress-JDS government seems to be wanting to please all sides.

172,Sanghamitra,"After Saudi Arabia is tasked with heading the United Nations Human Rights Commission, AAP's battle on the fake news will be the next legendary event. Winter is coming. After the pristine air quality of Delhi was brutally devastated by Hindu terrorists busting firecrackers to celebrate their pagan festival, a dark, evil winter is approaching the national capital and it is coming fast. The Kejriwal muffler has been taken out of the closet. The Hawai chappals have been paired with woollen socks and the order has been given. A long night of cold doubts and misinformation is imminent, for the night is dark and full of terrors. An army is marching. The Lord had spoken in his cough strained voice and the commanders are leading battalions of sombre, slow-walking fighters. Dragging their feet in the frost clad streets of Delhi, chanting their mantra with a rhythm that reverberates the freezing particulate heavy air of Delhi. Did you just read the above para in Jon Snow’s voice? Did you wonder “but the night king’s army is silent”. Through 7 seasons of Game of Thrones, the dead zombies of the frozen lands have not spoken a word except for shrieks and grunts, then how can they chant some Mantra? This is not the night king’s zombies we are discussing, dear readers, we are discussing Kejriwal’s AAP’s 15,000 ‘social media warriors’. Soon, all your TLs, homepages and WhatsApp are going to be flooded by the Arvind Kejriwal led AAP army’s battle cry, Is this true, Is this true, is this true? Kejriwal’s AAP is planning a full frontal war of fake news. Sorry, that was a typo. We meant ‘on’ fake news of course. As per a report in Hindustan Times, army commander Ankit Lal has gathered 15,000 volunteers to be active on social media and counter ‘fake news’. The army is to be battle-ready by mid-December and that is when we all should expect them to strike. After Saudi Arabia  is tasked with heading the United Nations Human Rights Commission, AAP’s battle on fake news will be the next legendary event. Fake news is the new ‘intolerance in India’. Our secular liberals use it in abundance to pontificate. When needed, fake news is coated with the ubiquitous ‘is this true’ and is sent out to the universe to morph and spread. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey met Rahul Gandhi yesterday to discuss the menace of fake news. However, looking at the history of statements by Rahul Gandhi , it was only apt, because, as CEO of Twitter, Jack was not fussing about the menace, he went to confront the menace himself. Imagine a world where Britain discusses the damages done by colonialism. Tipu Sultan condemns forced conversions. Indian TV serials talk sense. Salman Khan conducts lectures on driving regulations and the clerics of Darul Uloom Deoband hold a conference on women empowerment. Unlikely as they may seem, politics is the realm of infinite possibilities and AAP fits right in. Kejriwal’s AAP and fake news have known each other for a long time. What better way to combat an enemy if you do not know it well. From claiming PM did not allow Kejriwal to carry his mobile phone  to the PM favouring China for import of manjas for kites, AAP has done it all. Covered with the safety helmet of ‘Is this true?’ , the little lies and misinformation are shared with the masses, waiting for doubts and confusion to take their course. AAP has able commanders to lead this army. Equipped with arts of obfuscation, impunity and sharp instincts of blaming Modi for everything under the sun, these commanders are the masters of their art. Be it their IT cell head  to their ministers and MLAs, the AAP army is undoubtedly in good hands. The arts of war come in myriad forms and AAP leaders have mastered all of it. How many people can boast of timing a photograph  at the exact nano-second where a tear-drop is dangling precariously on the edge of someone’s lip? Or manage a sly ‘you deserve it’ whenever they hear of a political opponent suffering from a disease ? AAP does and it does it in style. AAP leaders are more skilled than the best shapeshifters. They can be EVM engineers one day and defence experts on the next. One day they are economists and just like that they become psephologists. The days of dharna are over. People have just seen too many dharnas and the images of relaxed men spread over plush sofas demanding ‘justice’ are unlikely to create a mass movement. Those critics who frowned over the sight of Delhi’s CM and two senior ministers lying on sofas  of Raj Bhawan for days on end will get their answers as to what ‘work’ was being done when the formidable army of 15,000 AAP volunteers will sweep over millions of smartphones and laptops. As Kejrwail’s AAP army prepares to march, we Indians must brace ourselves for the onslaught. 2019 general elections are near and by the time the winter is over, the cyberworld as we know it will not be the same.

173,OpIndia Staff,"It is evident that Rahul Gandhi is throwing muck and lying through his teeth in the hopes that some allegation of corruption sticks. With lies after lies being debunked by all and sundry, it is evident that Rahul Gandhi is losing the plot.  On 12th November 2018, Rahul Gandhi met Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey  to discuss ‘fake news’. This drew a litany of responses from many considering Rahul Gandhi and his party themselves are purveyors fake news and also because Twitter hasn’t been the most unbiased platform  lately. The irony of the matter became even more glaring when on the very day that Rahul Gandhi and the Twitter CEO met to discuss fake news, Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to spread fake news about Prime Minister Narendra Modi and how demonetisation has led to action against Shell companies. Congress President Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter and tweeted a ‘barf’ worthy tweet. He asserted that the PM Modi was ‘barfing’ about how demonetisation led to action against Shell firms. He also mentioned a litany of lies against other people connected to BJP. Rahul Gandhi’s first lie was that demonetisation has not led to action against Shell companies. A shell company is a non-trading company used as a vehicle for various financial manoeuvres or kept dormant for future use in some other capacity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on 8th November 2016 declared that Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes would be considered illegal tenders. The move had a significant impact on formalising the economy, digitisation of transactions and left-wing terrorism. Following the step, a major crackdown on shell companies was initiated by the Modi government. In April 2017, ED raided hundreds of locations  in 16 cities in order to crack down on shell companies. Various teams comprising of 300 officials raided the premises in cities like Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Patna, Ranchi, Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar and Bengaluru to name a few. Some of the companies which were raided had links to prominent politicians like YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal and a controversial Noida bureaucrat Yadav Singh. Incidentally, Reddy , Bhujbal  have been under investigation for money laundering in the past.",2018-11-13,"anil ambani,CEO,Congress lies,Demonetisation,fake news,Jack Dorsey,Jay Shah,modi government,Narendra Modi,piyush goyal,Rafale,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Reliance,shell companies,Twitter","Rahul Gandhi spreads fake news on Twitter, the day he met Jack Dorsey to discuss fake news on Twitter",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/rahul-gandhi-spreads-fake-news-on-twitter-the-day-he-met-jack-dorsey-to-discuss-fake-news-on-twitter/

Superstar Rajinikanth has made a significant comment on BJP ahead of Lok Sabha elections. He has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is much stronger compared to other political leaders in the country. After he entered politics, there was lots of speculation on whether he will be joining any political alliance. In that context, this comment carries a lot of significance. Rajinikanth said this while clarifying on a comment he made yesterday. Some media houses had quoted  him as saying “if parties here believe BJP is dangerous, then it must be”. He was answering a question about the opposition’s claim that BJP is dangerous. Rajinikanth had also said yesterday that demonetisation was not implemented properly. He said, “The implementation went wrong, it should have been carried out after a detailed research.” Both his comments had raised speculation whether he is trying to move to the opposition camp. But today the movie star turned politician has said that he was misquoted by media. Clarifying his statement yesterday, Rajinikanth said that he was not ready to give an opinion on BJP at this moment.

175,Abhishek Banerjee,"The moral of this story is that with Congress in power, Emergency is never too far away. The Emergency nearly came knocking on our doors just 11 years ago. In 2019, the BJP will face a Congress that is much more angry and vengeful than the Congress of 2004. These days “Freedom of Expression” is always in the news. Mostly because those who have enjoyed a monopoly over the country all these years find themselves out of power. So democracy is always in danger these days. A speaker gets dropped from a conference? Democracy in danger. A minor students union leader gets arrested? Fascism is here! What would actually put democracy in danger? Let’s see. How about shutting down India’s largest opposition party? So let me tell you about the time that nearly happened. No, I am not going to talk about Emergency. I will tell you about 2007. That’s just 11 years ago. Fascism came that close to becoming a reality in India. And the sad thing is that you probably never heard of this event. That’s how real fascism is done. In early 2007, the BJP released a campaign CD in the run-up to the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. As you would expect, rival parties were criticizing each other’s campaign material. In this case, some people and some sections of the media said that the material in the BJP’s campaign CD was “communal”. The BJP’s adversaries filed a complaint with the Election Commission. Still routine stuff, right? No! This was different. This was not the typical case of parties stepping on each other’s toes. The BJP was summoned for a derecognition hearing before the Election Commission of India. You read that right. They were not kidding. The threat before the BJP was that of actual derecognition. This is the sort of thing you expect to hear from Pakistan or North Korea or Venezuela. The state getting ready to shut down the main opposition party! In 2007, the BJP had over 150 Members of Parliament, half a dozen or so Chief Ministers and hundreds of elected MLAs. Not to mention thousands of elected representatives at all levels of local governments. Would India have remained a democracy in any real sense if the BJP had been banned in 2007? Not only was the BJP to be subjected to a derecognition hearing, one of the Election Commissioners hearing the case would be Navin Chawla. At the time, Election Commissioner Navin Chawla was facing accusations that trusts run by him and his wife had received  money, favours and cheap land from various Congress leaders and Congress governments. That’s not all. The Shah Commission which was set up to probe the horrors of the Emergency had strongly indicted Navin Chawla for acting in a “callous and authoritarian” manner during the Emergency. This same “callous and authoritarian” officer later went on to become Election Commissioner of the world’s largest democracy. How wonderful. So the BJP protested. They repeatedly demanded that as a bare minimum show of fairness, Navin Chawla should not sit in judgement over the BJP during the derecognition hearing. The BJP’s plea against the presence of Election Commissioner Navin Chawla was duly considered by the Election Commission. And surprise! Surprise! The Election Commission decided  that the Election Commission is absolutely right. Again, the sort of news you would expect to hear from Pakistan, North Korea or Venezuela. Now, whose instructions could Navin Chawla have been following? This might give us a clue . A few years later, Chief Election Commissioner N Gopalaswami wrote a letter to the President requesting the removal of Navin Chawla. One of the allegations was that whenever an important issue came up before the EC, Chawla would excuse himself for a bathroom break and soon after the CEC would get calls from top Congress leaders! Feeling like some sort of banana republic yet? So, how did the BJP escape being shut down? They had to resort to a legal technicality, by means of which they argued  that the Election Commission doesn’t actually have the power to derecognize a political party. The exact technicality was drawing some sort of distinction between acts of Parliament and “executive orders”. However, the Congress, the Left and the BSP argued that derecognition was actually within the powers of the Election Commission. Mind you that in 2007, the Cong, the Left and the BSP were all either part of the ruling UPA government or supporting it in the Lok Sabha. All ruling parties united in a demand to ban the main opposition! Definitely not a danger for democracy I guess… The derecognition hearing was held, BJP was asked to condemn the CD & submit a compliance report in 15 days.  But the Election Commission made  it “ This is a story of Indian liberalism. When not in power, they will protest over angry tweets. When in power, they will try to ban the main opposition. No liberal back in 2007 said that a ban on BJP would be undemocratic. So what if the BJP had polled 9 crore votes in 2004? Liberals saw no harm in throwing all these votes out of the door and disenfranchising more than a fifth of the Indian electorate. Today they say that democracy is in danger because too many BJP supporters are posting angry tweets. Imagine if the same were happening today. Imagine if the Congress Party were dragged to a derecognition hearing before an Election Commissioner that many believed to be a BJP puppet! Can you imagine the kind of outpouring of rhetoric that would happen if the BJP were doing this to the Congress today? Let alone the Congress, remember what was said when the BJP government tried to crack down on a few students union leaders from JNU? The moral of this story is that with Congress in power, Emergency is never too far away. The Emergency nearly came knocking on our doors just 11 years ago. In 2019, the BJP will face a Congress that is much more angry and vengeful than the Congress of 2004.

177,OpIndia Staff,"Bukhari was kidnapped earlier this year and Siddiqui had had a close escape from a kidnapping attempt in January. According to a Reuters  report, Twitter has forewarned two Pakistan rights activists for sharing objectionable content on their Twitter pages. Activist Gul Bukhari and Taha Siddiqui  have received the warnings. Bukhari was kidnapped  in Pakistan for a short while earlier this year and Siddiqui too had had a close shave with a kidnapping attempt. The move indicates the Pakistani government’s collaboration with the Social Media giant Twitter to curb ‘inconvenient’ free speech online. Recently, Twitter had also suspended the account of a fundamentalist cleric who had warned the government and the judiciary against the release of a Christian woman charged under blasphemy laws. Defending the freedom of speech of the activists, a civil rights advocate said the activists’ tweets were not the same as those of the hate-mongers since they did not promote violence, supplementing that the complaints seemed to be a part of an attack to squelch well-disposed critique within Pakistan. In its defense, Twitter said that it informs its users about their government’s disapproval regarding the posts shared by them that are in contravention to Pakistan’s laws. It is interesting to note that Twitter has denied all the 156 requests from Pakistan to remove content from January 2012 to December 2017, according to the company’s global Transparency Report. However, the data for 2018 is yet to be published. Nighat Dad, a Pakistani lawyer, and internet activist claimed that these warnings illustrate how the Pakistani regime wants to regulate the discourse on Social Media platforms. In an email exchange, Twitter informed activist Taha Siddiqui that it had received complaints about his account’s violations of Pakistani laws from the government and warned him of further action without specifying it. “Pakistani authorities are pressuring Twitter to take ‘legal’ steps against me,” Siddiqui said. He admonished Twitter for being supporters of a repressive regime. Pakistan’s Information Minister Fawwad Chaudhry stated that his team is in close coordination with Twitter authorities to restrict hate speech and threats on Twitter. However, he was tight-lipped about the warnings given to the activists, including Gul Bukhari. Bukhari, known to be critical of Pakistan government, said that in one of her email correspondence, Twitter referred to a tweet that criticized the government’s lack of action against a prominent cleric responsible for the warning. The cleric, Khadim Hussain Rizvi’s account was eventually suspended for threatening the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi in a blasphemy case. Recently, Twitter has come under fire with activists from different corners of the world accusing Twitter of regulating and controlling thoughts through its shady inherently biased violations policies. Even Twitter India hasn’t been immune from this contagion. Last week, Twitter India arbitrarily suspended  a TV journalist, Jagrati Shukla’s account for echoing Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat’s position on the stone pelters in Kashmir. It has also randomly suspended or shadow-banned accounts of right-leaning personalities who were either severely critical of Congress leaders or those who made innocuous spoofs  on the Congress President Rahul Gandhi.",2018-11-13,"Censorship,Free Speech,harassment,Jack Dorsey,left liberals,rahul gandhi,Twitter,Twitter India,twitter suspension",Twitter cautions Pakistani rights activists over anti-government tweets,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/twitter-cautions-pakistani-rights-activists-over-anti-government-tweets/
178,OpIndia Staff,"Congress has released  its 112-page manifesto called ‘Vachan Patra’ on Saturday ahead of Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections. Continuing with its soft-Hindutva, Congress in its Madhya Pradesh manifesto has made several promises in that direction. Congress’ Madhya Pradesh manifesto promises setting up of Gaushalas at all village panchayats. It also promises construction of Ram Path and a Narmada Parikrama route. Congress has also promised to promote Sanskrit. Congress has been indulging in Soft-Hindutva in Madhya Pradesh after Gujarat elections. Congress says that if voted to power, it will set up a special Spiritual Department the state. The manifesto promises development of Narmada river, which will include a Narmada Parikrama route for the devotees. There will be rest houses at every 50 km on the route, the party promises. The party also promises to build a ‘Ram Path’, a mythical path taken by Lord Ram during his exile. This path will be from Chitrakoot to the borders of Chhattisgarh. The promises in Congress’ Madhya Pradesh manifesto sound unbelievable considering their history of anti-Hindu and anti-cow politics rhetoric. Congress’ concern for Hindu sentiments stands exposed when its party workers have indulged in acts that hurt Hindu sentiments. People have hardly forgotten the horrible incident when members of Youth Congress in Kannur had brutally slaughtered  a calf in full public view to protest against the government’s notification to restrict the sale of cattle in the markets for slaughter purposes. This incident had led to huge public outrage. However, at that time, Congress had distanced itself from the incident by suspending the members involved. But Rijil Makkutty, the Youth Congress’s Kannur mandal president, who had led this ‘protest’, had claimed  that the Youth Congress State President was aware of the plan. Few days after this incident, a Congress MLA from the Kerala, VT Balram, posted  a video of consuming beef with friends to express solidarity with those who have been organising beef fest across the state. Congress, which once tried  to demolish Ram Sethu calling Lord Ram a fictional character, also has to its credit the coining of the word ‘Hindu Terror’. As per WikiLeaks , Congress scion and soon to be President of the party, Rahul Gandhi had declared in the US in 2009, that Hindu extremists were a bigger threat to India than Islamic terrorists.

The manifesto promised a revocation of the relaxation given to government employees to attend RSS shakhas. “I have been hurt with the Congress’s manifesto which pledges that holding of RSS shakhas in government premises in Madhya Pradesh would be banned. Besides, the pledge mentioned the ban on government staffers from going to RSS shakhas. This amounts to violating the fundamental rights of the government staffers”, said the Advocate General. Bhargava also appealed to the voters to not vote for anti-national forces. He stated, “Such ban creates a fear among the citizens against government servants. I request the residents of Madhya Pradesh and young friends to exercise their franchise against anti-national forces by fulfilling their duty to organisation fostering nationalism.” Bhargava told  PTI that he had indeed uploaded the video. He added that he has approached the Election Commission on Saturday for taking action against Congress in this regard. The Congress’ anti-RSS manifesto isn’t surprising considering previous statements made by senior leaders of the party. During his foreign tours, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had compared  the RSS with the Muslim Brotherhood. We had speculated  then that the Congress may be planning a crackdown on the organization. Congress leaders in Bihar have previously demanded  a ban on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s entry in the state. The Congress party has also alleged  that Pakistan and RSS are on the “same page in propagating hatred, violence and division among people.” It is a bit contradictory considering senior leaders of the Congress party often praise  Pakistan profusely. A senior leader had even stated in Pakistan that Narendra Modi needs to be removed  from power for talks between the two countries to proceed. The Congress had allegedly  tried to frame RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat in its pursuit of the ‘Saffron terror’ narrative as well. The Congress perceives the continued existence of the RSS as a moral threat to its political relevance. Thus, it’s only natural that they might try to attack the RSS through legislative means if they return to power.",2018-11-12,"Congress,Madhya Pradesh,mani shankar aiyer,Mohan Bhagwat,rahul gandhi,RSS",Congress demands removal of Deputy Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh for sharing an anti-Congress video,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/congress-demand-removal-deputy-advocate-general-video-social-media-on-madhya-pradesh-manifesto-ban-government-employees-attending-rss/
180,Nirwa Mehta,"Jack 'explained' some of the steps taken by Twitter to keep conversations 'healthy and tackle the menace of fake news' to Rahul Gandhi. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who is on his maiden visit to India , met Congress President Rahul Gandhi. After Rahul Gandhi posted  their pictures on Twitter, Twitter erupted with memes and jokes galore. Ironically, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ‘explained’ some of the steps taken by Twitter to keep conversations ‘healthy and tackle the menace of fake news’ to Rahul Gandhi. I am glad that Rahul Gandhi has taken a refresher course from the Twitter CEO, considering his social media team regularly indulges in spreading lies  and photoshopped images  on Twitter. Congress’ social media head Divya Spandana, too, has shared fake clipping  of newspaper to malign the BJP. Wonder if Rahul Gandhi confessed to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey that his party’s social media head advocates creating multiple fake accounts  and how she ‘uses psychoanalysis ‘ to influence people? And did they have a good laugh at all the ‘#KnowYourLegacy ‘ goof-ups by Congress Twitter account? My personal favourite is the one where Congress Twitter account made Indira Gandhi inaugurate a project 8 years after she had died . Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has earlier admitted  the left-leaning bias of his employees. Twitter has been under fire recently after it showed bias against right-leaning accounts. Last year in November, Twitter ‘paused’ general verification of profiles. Twitter also ‘de-verified’ already verified profiles where Twitter users behaviour was not falling within the ‘new guidelines ‘. The anti-right bias of Twitter has been apparent. During the end of 2016 predominantly Right Wing  accounts in India were soon getting suspended after criticising the Aam Aadmi Party. Twitter suspended  another popular Right Wing allegedly for questioning Kejriwal and anti-nationals. Things became slightly more brazen when it was seen that a total of 7 ABVP accounts were suspended  by Twitter. Twitter restored the accounts only after protests by supporters. Twitter’s arbitrary policy  which led to the suspension of accounts of right-wing Twitter users on social media has also been questioned. In March, Twitter users asked users to delete tweets with the phrase ‘kill me’. Twitter proceeded to suspend the accounts which did not delete.

Addressing a rally in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, Prime Minister Modi today mocked the recently released Congress’ election manifesto. Pointing out that the word ‘sir’ was used  too many times to refer to Rahul Gandhi, he said, “for them, Chhattisgarh is less important than ‘Naamdaar’.” Taking a dig at the Gandhi family he said  that those who themselves are out on bail obtained by dubious money are busy in distributing the honesty certificates to everyone. Earlier, Prime Minister Modi while addressing a rally in Jagdalpur had said that Congress is busy protecting ‘Urban Maoists’  who sit in air-conditioned rooms and have destroyed the lives of Adivasis. “The hands which should hold pens, some people put guns in them.

182,OpIndia Staff,"The government also reiterates that it has no role to play in the election of offset partners by the vendors, and there will be hundreds of offset contracts, as there are 2 vendors and 33 sub-vendors with offset obligations in the deal. Today the government of India submitted an affidavit at the Supreme Court detailing the steps of the decision-making process before ordering 36 Rafale jets from France. On 10said  October, the Supreme Court had asked  that it would like to know about the steps taken in the decision-making process. Further on 31 Obeying that order, the government has provided the details of the Rafale deal to the petitioners. The norms and procedures were all followed in the Rafale deal, said the government. The response of government gives a detailed account of the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), which governs all defence related procurements by the Indian government. The government amended through several reviews the DPP which was introduced in 2002. The government notes the Preamble of the DPP, which states that defence acquisition is not a standard open market commercial transaction and it has several unique features like supplier constraints, technical complexity, foreign supplier, geopolitical ramifications etc. That’s why decision making in defence procurement is unique and complex. The government says that it followed the Defence Procurement Procedure-2013 (DPP-2013) in the procurement of 36 Rafale jets. The reply mentions every step involved in the DPP-2013, from the preparation of user requirement to the award of the contract. It says that Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) is the highest body for defence procurement matters. The DAC is headed by the defence minister and it includes all Service Chiefs, along with several secretaries in the defence ministry. The reply of government gives background the deal. In 2007, bid for 126 fighter aircraft was issued, which was for the direct purchase of 18 aircraft and rest 108 to be made in India. Six vendors submitted their proposals in 2008. Detail technical and field evaluations were conducted in 2009 and 2010. In 2011 commercial bids were opened, and Dassault Aviation was selected as the winner in 2012. After that, contract negotiations started in the same year. But the negotiation could not be concluded due to differences over the manufacture of 108 jets in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The reason for this was lack of agreement between Dassault and HAL over the following issues: This situation remained in place for more than three years, delaying the purchase. This delay also increased the cost of purchase, due to in-built escalation and also variations in Euro-Rupee exchange rates. During the period, enemies of India had already inducted more than 400 fighter planes. This delay was also impacting other upgradation programs of Indian Air Force.  In view of this, the decision to purchase 36 Rafale jets in fly-way condition was taken. The reply by government states that all requisite steps as per the DPP-2013 were followed while deciding to purchase 36 jets. After completion of the processes under the DPP, necessary approval of the DAC was taken in 2015. The DAC was informed that the capability of the 36 Rafale aircraft will be as per the requirement for the original bid to buy 126 jets. An Indian Negotiation Team (INT) was constituted to negotiate the terms and conditions for the deal, which was headed by the Deputy Chief of Air Staff of the IAF. A total of 26 meetings took place between Indian and French sides, while the INT met 48 times for internal meetings. A variety of aspects, including pricing, delivery schedule, maintenance terms, offsets, etc were discussed in those meetings. The government says that INT had arrived at better terms related to price, delivery and maintenance as compared to the earlier order for 126 jets. After finalising the deal, it was placed before the Cabinet Committee on Security in August 2016. The CCS provided the due approval on the same day. After this, the relevant protocols for the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) were signed between Indian Defence Minister and French Defence Minister, on behalf of the respective governments. As the major controversy created by the opposition in the deal is one offset partner selected by Dassault, the government has given a detail response on offsets. The government states that no private business house was mentioned in the IGA or Offset Contract. The offset clause does not envisage manufacture of the 36 Rafale aircraft in India by any public or private sector firm. And as per Offset Contract, the vendor is required to provide the details of Indian Offset Partners at the time of claiming offset credits or one year before discharge of offset obligation. As per the contract, the annual offset implementation will start from October 2019, and Dassault is yet to submit any formal proposal for carrying out offset obligations. A foreign vendor that discharge offset obligations by several routes, they are: Government’s reply says that vendor will be responsible for fulfilment of offset obligations. If the Defence Ministry has not barred the Indian enterprise, then the vendor is free to select an enterprise of their choosing. The offset guidelines under DPP-2013 governs the offset contracts under Rafale deal. The deals signed were two separate deals, one with Dassault and the other with MBDA, which is providing missiles for the jets bought by India. There is no offset obligation in the first three years of signing the contracts, which means the obligations start from October 2019 onwards. Other than the two vendors, offset obligation will also have to discharged by Tier-1 sub-vendors. Dassault has 21 such Tier-1 sub-vendors and MBDA has 12. The government of India’s response clarified that they followed every norm under the Defence Procurement Policy while deciding to purchase the 36 Rafale jets. The government also reiterates that it has no role to play in the election of offset partners by the vendors, and there will be hundreds of offset contracts, as there are 2 vendors and 33 sub-vendors with offset obligations in the deal.",2018-11-12,"Congress,Dassault,French government,modi government,rafale deal,Rafale jets,Rafale Scam,supreme court","Modi govt provides details of decision making process involved in Rafale deal, says all procedures followed",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/modi-govt-provides-details-of-decision-making-process-involved-in-rafale-deal-says-all-procedures-followed/

185,Abhishek Banerjee,"Dig into the histories of the liberals you see on TV. You will find their roots in college AISA and SFI unions. Some of the older liberals and their friends will openly tell you about the heady days of the 1970s when they dreamed of “revolution” and possibly worked for it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a recent election rally, spoke about how Urban Maoists live in big cities but wreck the lives of those living in rural areas. He also spoke about Congress’ support to these Urban Maoists. This needed to be said. All my life I have wondered. How come no leftist sitting in a TV studio, a university or a think tank is ever asked to answer for what left-wing extremists are doing in this country? On the other hand, the left has never been shy of connecting any transgression, no matter how small, committed by a right-winger (real or perceived) directly to the Hindu right. Some right winger on Twitter posts an angry tweet directed at a woman. Within minutes the left wing propaganda news channels and websites are buzzing: Modi must answer. Meanwhile, liberal terrorists are carrying out an armed occupation of large parts of the country. Literally, hundreds of people are murdered by these liberal terrorists. But don’t you ask the oily liberal sitting in TV studios and lecturing us about democracy. Apparently, we must learn to respect the difference between CPI(XYZ) and CPI(X) and CPI(XY) and CPI(XY)(Z) faction. Total nonsense. Typical of terror outfits to conceal their hands behind a maze of political organizations. Somebody needed to talk about the front organizations for liberal terror operating in our TV studios think tanks and universities. PM Modi has gone to Bastar, the heart of liberal terror and drawn a straight line linking fashionable liberals to their terrorist arm. The people of India deserved to hear this said out loud. Above all, the local people of Bastar needed to hear this. The liberals enjoy life in air-conditioned luxury, send their children to study in America. And when (and if) they return, they have cushy jobs waiting for them, all provided by the liberal cocktail circuit. They are promoted as “intellectuals” and opinion makers in media and academia. Meanwhile, the poisonous ideology flowing from the liberals in Lutyens is disseminated with pamphlets and guns to youngsters in Bastar. While the youth is sucked out of Bastar and sent to perish in the forests for a rotten cause, the liberal masterminds are sipping government subsidized wine at the top clubs in Delhi. Occasionally, a liberal will actually grab some forest land from local Adivasis  and build a nice bungalow where they can come and chill out for vacation. During these vacations, these creative liberals will take notes about the “struggle” of adivasis against the Indian state. These notes are then polished for a global audience.  Multi-million dollar book deals are struck and then the liberal flies around London and New York collecting adulation and awards. Remember that TV media cried for a week when some “tribal rights activist” was put under “house arrest”, whatever that means. Remember that Trilochan Mahato was an actual tribal. He was just an 18 year old boy. And because he supported BJP, the liberal goons murdered him and hung his body from a tree. It was all so brazen that liberals even wrote on his shirt that he was being murdered for supporting BJP. The liberal TV media barely even covered this story. Remember how surrendered Naxal Pahad Singh, who was interviewed by OpIndia, claimed that he saw Arun Ferreira,  one of the arrested Urban Maoists  in a central committee meeting deep in the jungles. He was a tribal. Remember how he was trashed and discredited when he said that these ‘jobless intellectuals’  are responsible for the bloodshed  of Adivasis. Tribal rights “activists” matter. An actual tribal doesn’t matter. See? Today, more than ever, we need to be conscious of the danger of Urban Maoists  among us. Let me tell you why.  In the past, the left tried to enforce its ideology through armed invasion and occupation. In Bengal, leftists would break into the homes of dissenters, slaughter them publicly and then make the mother eat the rice soaked in the blood of her sons. The liberals realize that those days are over.  The left has now changed its tactics. And remember that the free market is always the most efficient way to distribute something. Instead of invading people’s homes by breaking down the front door, the sinister liberal has found a smoother way. They can just enter your home through your television, through the social media on your computer and the newspaper left on your front door. When your young son or daughter goes to school or college, there is a liberal waiting to teach him how to be a traitor. In the language of social justice, of course. They have mastered the art of using the devices of the Indian state to destroy it. The Stalinist of yesterday has become the human rights activist of today. Dig into the histories of the liberals you see on TV. You will find their roots in college AISA and SFI unions. Some of the older liberals and their friends will openly tell you about the heady days of the 1970s when they dreamed of “revolution” and possibly worked for it. Do not be fooled.  They have merely changed their strategy. But they still serve the same master. And their objective is precisely the same: the overthrow of the Indian state. This is an information war. Like ISIS, the liberals understand advertising, PR strategies and mass psychology very well. They market social justice, in the same way, ISIS recruiters on the web package and sell the vision of an “Islamic Caliphate” to impressionable people everywhere. The antidote is to tell people about the reality of the Islamic State, the atrocities they carry out and the horrors of life under ISIS. Similarly, we can stop the Communist evil only by lifting the curtain and exposing the direct line from liberal intellectuals to Maoist terrorists. Like ISIS agents online, the urban Maoists offer utopian visions of a wonderful and fair world. The reality is that they want to recruit people to carry out mass murder in the forests of Chhattisgarh.

The posters are being put up by the Darbha Divisional Committee, which was responsible for the attack on Congress leader Mahendra Karma and his team ahead of the 2013 polls. The Maoists have also resorted to vandalism and blackening of the EC posters put up to encourage voting in Maoist affected areas. The EC notices around polling booths in areas of Hiroli, Pirnarh or Perpa under Samalwar panchayat have been vandalised by the Maoists and have painted their slogans, flags or messages all around EC notice, asking the police and officials to leave the village. “Seems they [Maoists] want their presence felt and we even had to carry three trucks of banners and posters out of Bhairamgarh area a few days back, to clear the area of Maoist material,” a senior police official said.

188,Nirwa Mehta,"Many believe that this posturing might not help Congress in actual electoral terms, as RSS-bashing is more of an 'intellectual grandstanding' than real politics. Congress, in its manifesto released yesterday in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, has vowed to not allow RSS Shakhas in government buildings. The 112-page manifesto also asserted that the order issued  earlier to allow government employees to attend ‘Shakhas’ of RSS will also be revoked. However, banning the ‘Shakhas’ from the government buildings may get Congress an applause from the ‘intellectuals’ circle, it may not necessarily convert into votes. “In Madhya Pradesh, Congressis are not anti-Hindu. They are also not the activists or NGO type. In fact, many Congress leaders themselves maybe RSS members. This is neither unheard of nor unthinkable. This promise in the Congress manifesto wreaks of Delhi elitism and activist view and may backfire in Madhya Pradesh,” Ashish Chandorkar, author and political analyst told OpIndia. Many believe that this posturing might not help Congress in actual electoral terms, as RSS-bashing is more of an ‘intellectual grandstanding’ than real politics. “Both Congress and BJP in Madhya Pradesh are known for infighting, though Congress suffers more from it. I think this promise to ban RSS is a result of Delhi mindset, which will get applauded in Delhi newsrooms but will not help them in getting any extra votes,” said a source close to the RSS. Congress is known to play divisive politics. Earlier in May, Congress had demanded  that the entry of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat be banned in Bihar stating that he ‘represents hateful ideas’. When former President and Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee  addressed RSS cadres at Nagpur, he recieved a lot of flak from his former colleagues. Not only that, Days after Congress President Rahul Gandhi compared Muslim Brotherhood to the RSS , Congress IT cell head Divya Spandana  drew parallels between the two on social media. Which is kind of amusing since many Congress supporting ‘activists’ and commentators have often pointed out how local Congress units often try to reach out to some sections of RSS. However, taking on the RSS is not the only thing Congress has vowed. Continuing its ‘soft-Hindutva ‘ approach, Congress has promised an ‘Adhyatmik Vibhag’ (spiritual department) as well as plans to promote the Sanskrit language. Congress also reportedly talks about developing the ‘Ram Path’ the route which Lord Ram is believed to have taken during his 14 years in exile. Congress has also promised commercial production of ‘gau mutra’ (cow urine) and cow dung as well as setting up of ‘gau shala’ (cowshed) in every village panchayat. With elections coming closer, Congress has upped their ante  to show that they are a ‘Hindu-friendly’ party. While Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had announced Rahul Gandhi has ‘Brahmin samaj DNA’, Kamal Nath had promised a ‘gau shala’  in every panchayat. After his recent pilgrimage to Mansarovar, posters of Rahul Gandhi posing as a Shiv-bhakt had also appeared across Madhya Pradesh.

In an interview  with The News Minute on November 8, National Commission for Women (NCW) acting Chairperson Rekha Sharma has asserted that forced conversions in the state of Kerala are real and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was like “an ostrich who is keeping his head buried in the sand.” Sharma said that the issue was not being taken seriously by anyone, including the Chief Minister. “I have been here (in Kerala) for a few days, and I am aware that forceful conversion is taking place. The Chief Minister is still not taking the issue seriously. He might have seen the Aamir Khan movie, where he says ‘All is well.’ And is under the impression that all is well in the state,” Rekha Sharma said.  “Neither the government nor other political parties are taking this seriously. They need to wake up,” she added. Sharma also claimed that foreign funds are being used to convert girls to a particular faith and asserted that it is an issue that needs to be probed. “There are many young people who are forcefully converting vulnerable young women in Kerala, to another religion. These men must be getting financial assistance from outside India. The foreign funding behind the conversion of vulnerable young women in Kerala must be probed,” she said. Earlier, the NIA had flagged  the brainwashing and conversion of Hindu women in the state by radical Islamist outfits such as the PFI. PFI is allegedly involved  in hypnotic counselling of Hindu girls in order to convert them in their religious centres as per NIA investigations. A religious facilitation centre managed by PFI called ‘Sathyasarini/Markaz Hidaya Da’wa Institute’ in Manjeri, Kerala is allegedly connected with 9 out of 11 cases of ‘Love-Jihad’ investigated by NIA. Earlier this year, Islamist outfit Popular Front of India had claimed  that they spent Rs 1 crore in pursuing the case of Hadiya, formerly known as Akhila Asokan in the Supreme Court.

Adding to the list of bloopers committed by social media team of Congress, Mahila Congress today, in an attempt to pay their respects to independent India’s first Education Minister, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, referred to him as ‘Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad’, mixing up his name with former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam. This is rather appalling that being a part of an institution which claims to be the oldest and the first political party in India, the members of the Mahila Congress probably need a lesson in history while remembering our first education minister. The Central Government with a resolution dated September 11, 2008, has declared  November 11, the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, freedom fighter, eminent educationist and the first Union Minister of Education, as National Education Day. This is, however, not the first time Congress members have exhibited such ignorance on the public platform. Umpteen number of times, earlier, other Congress members including Rahul Gandhi, their leader, (in the true sense of the word) has made headlines for reasons often less flattering.

They had also goofed up  in dates while paying tributes on death anniversary. They had written the date of death (27th September 1833) before the date of birth (22nd May 1772) which appears as if he was born on 27th September 1833 and passed away on 22nd May 1772 which is just not possible.

195,OpIndia Staff,"Rahul Gandhi claimed that the Modi government had waived off 1.3 lakh crores worth of loans for industrialists, in Karnataka, it became 2.5 lakh crores and now in Chhattisgarh, it has become 3.5 lakh crores. Addressing a rally in poll-bound Chhattisgarh’s Kanker region, the Congress President Rahul Gandhi once again resorted  to spreading lies about the Industrialists’ ‘loans waived’ by the present regime. This time around, he alleged that the Modi government has waived loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore of 15 select industrialists since 2014. “Modiji gave Rs 3.5 lakh crore to the 15 richest people of the country in last 4-5 years. For running MGNREGA scheme in the country, an amount of Rs 35,000 crore is needed yearly but he waived loans worth 10 times that amount of 15 select industrialists,” He was quoted as saying by PTI. The Gandhi dynasty scion held a massive roadshow in the incumbent Chief Minister Dr. Raman Singh’s constituency Rajnandgaon. Targeting PM Modi, Gandhi alleged that the prime minister did not fulfil the promises he made to people ahead of the 2014 election. Continuing with his habitual tirade against the Modi government, he claimed that the government is helping cronies while ignoring the distressed farmers. But it appears that evoking ridiculous sophistries about loans being waived off for industrialists is a sinister ploy often employed by Rahul Gandhi while addressing rallies in rural India. In November 2016, addressing a large group of Congress activists in Bhiwandi, Rahul Gandhi claimed  that the Modi government had then waived off loans worth Rs 1.1 lakh crores of big industrialists. During campaigning for Gujarat assembly polls in 2017, Rahul Gandhi inexplicably  increased this figure by astounding 20000 Crores to Rs 1.3 lakh crores and repeated the same trite. In Karnataka, he went a step ahead and conjured up another grand figure- Rs 2.5 Lakh crores of industrialists’ ‘loans’ being waived off by the Modi Government, again with no proof whatsoever. With such glaring inconsistencies in figures  quoted by Congress president without providing any credible evidence to back his claims, one is left to wonder if Rahul Gandhi is simply using it as a political plank to fool unsuspecting farmers and garner their sympathy votes or is he a victim of hallucinations about imaginary loans being waived off by the government. Or maybe he is simply not intelligent enough to grasp the nitty-gritty of loan waivers. In fact, his lies were exposed when he failed to differentiate between loan waivers and loan write-offs. The BJP has maintained that it has not waived off a single rupee of loans given to industrialists. BJP President Amit Shah categorically denied  waiving off of any loans extended to the industrialists. Yesterday, the BJP held a presser  refuting the wild allegations made by Rahul Gandhi. The BJP stated that the Congress party has been in the Dhritarashtra mode for 10 years for the shell companies and has suddenly been weeping for them after demonetisation.",2018-11-10,"2018 Assembly Elections,chhattisgarh assembly elections,Congress,Congress lies,loan waiver,Loan write off,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,sonia gandhi",Rahul Gandhi and the eternally changing amount of ‘industrialists’ loans waived off’ by Modi,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/rahul-gandhi-and-the-eternally-changing-amount-of-industrialists-loans-waived-off-by-modi/

197,gujaratriotscom,"With Assembly elections soon to be held in Chhattisgarh, and BSP and CPI having formed an alliance with Ajit Jogi's party, the Jogis are in the news again. Ajit Jogi is the first Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and has a plethora of controversies to his name. With Assembly elections soon to be held in Chhattisgarh, and BSP and CPI having formed an alliance with Ajit Jogi’s party, the Jogis are in the news again. Ajit Jogi is the first Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh. He ruled for 3 years from November 2000 when the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh to 4 December 2003. A mechanical engineer from the Maulana Azad NIT (then REC) in Bhopal, he later passed IAS. He then joined Congress and was close to Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi. His wife is Renu Jogi and son is Amit Jogi. It will take an encyclopedia to even compile the list of illegal acts committed by the Jogi family. Let us first see the issues involving Amit Jogi, the son of Ajit Jogi: 1. Amit Jogi is the prime accused in the Ram Avtar Jaggi murder case. The then NCP Chhattisgarh treasurer Jaggi was murdered on 4 June 2003. A few months earlier senior Congress leader V C Shukla had left the Congress to join NCP along with his supporters. Ajit Jogi, the then Chief Minister, was miffed at this and managed to get back many of Shukla’s men from NCP back to the Congress. But Ram Avtar Jaggi did not return and stayed with V C Shukla and was murdered on 4 June 2003. Even the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under the UPA, which was called a ‘Caged Parrot’ by the Supreme Court and was thus in a way, a Congress Bureau of Investigation, said  that Amit Jogi was the brain and the prime conspirator in this. Amit Jogi (as well as Ajit Jogi) was acquitted by the trial court in 2007. But the CBI filed an appeal against his acquittal. Actually, the CBI urged the Central Government to give permission for filing an appeal, which was delayed for 4 years, and as soon as the permission was granted, it filed  an appeal. In Feb 2006 CNN-IBN reported  that Ajit Jogi had also been named as a co-conspirator in the case of the murder of Chhattisgarh state NCP treasurer Ram Avtar Jaggi after two of the several accused turned approver and gave statements in a Chhattisgarh court. Ajit Jogi was ultimately acquitted  in the case due to lack of sufficient evidence, but 19 were convicted, which included 4 Congress workers . The then NSUI state President, Ejaz Dhebar’s brother Yahyaha Dhebar was convicted and given life term, as was Chiman Singh, who actually shot Ramavtar Jaggi dead. Singh was a close associate  of Ajit Jogi. 2. Amit Jogi took the IAS exam in 2001 despite being a US citizen  under the SC category when his father Ajit Jogi was the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh. 3. The Times of India reported  that his parents got an ST certificate for him in 1986 at Bilaspur though he was a US citizen at that time, which is illegal. 4. It is alleged  that Amit Jogi gave the IAS on the fake ST certificate, though he claims he had informed the UPSC of his being a US citizen. But it is not possible to give IAS ‘informing’ anyone of being a non-Indian and the concerned people also denied any communication of this nature. This would mean that the charge that Amit Jogi used his fake certificate made in 1986 to give IAS seems to be true. 5. Amit Jogi was a US citizen and got Indian citizenship only in July 2004. His Indian visa expired on 31 October 2003 yet he continued to stay illegally in India even more than 1 and a half months after his visa expired. He was a holder of US passport, on a long-term visa, valid for five years from its issue in October 1998. 6. The CBI, during the UPA era as per the SC, also said in July 2005 (Under UPA rule) that Amit Jogi was behind the sting operation  of the late Dilip Singh Judeo. 7. Even Congress loyalist Outlook reported  the role of Jogis in this case. 8. Of course, now it has come to light that Amit Jogi gave 3 different versions  of his birthplace and date of birth. The Hindu had reported that Jogi submitting multiple dates and birthplaces in different forms and affidavits is curious. In his application dated December 15, 2001, for registration as an Indian citizen under Section 5(1)(A) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, Amit Jogi stated that he was born on August 7, 1977, in Dallas, Texas, U.S.A. On August 26, 2002, during his father’s tenure as Chief Minister, Amit Jogi applied for a State of Chhattisgarh Domicile Certificate in which he claimed he was born in Bilaspur on August 7, 1978, a full year after the date mentioned in his application form for Indian citizenship. Even in this application, Amit Jogi added another variation in his supporting affidavit, claiming his birthplace was Village Pendra, Bilaspur District. However, Amit Jogi was issued a Domicile Certificate on the basis of his application by the Collector, Raipur, affirming Chhattisgarh as his birthplace. On August 27, 2004 (during the BJP government’s rule in Chhattisgarh) Amit Jogi went on to apply for a Scheduled Tribe (ST) Certificate. In his application and sworn affidavit, Amit Jogi claimed that he was born on August 7, 1977 — not in Dallas, but in Gaurela, Pendra Road. However, the Patwari’s certificate submitted by Amit Jogi along with his application states that he was born in Saarbahara Village Tehsil Pendra Road, District Bilaspur. Apart from these glaring discrepancies within the same application, the validity of his claim for ST status has been hugely debated after the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes held that Ajit Jogi is not a Tribal. This was challenged by Ajit Jogi on the ground that the Commission has no power to probe an individual’s caste status. After a prolonged legal battle, the Supreme Court ordered a fresh enquiry into his caste status on October 13, 2011. After this exposure of 3 different versions of Amit Jogi’s birth certificates, Congress leader Rashid Alvi was asked by TV channel CNN-IBN to explain this issue of his birth certificates. He replied: “We will find out the truth and get back to you.” The Congress Party has still not broken its silence on this issue, even when the Jogis have left the party, which they left in 2016. Rahul Gandhi was and is, deafeningly silent on this issue ever since 2013. These are just the issues involving Amit Jogi. The Cash-for-MLAs scam of 2003 in which Ajit Jogi, Amit Jogi and Sonia Gandhi are all named on tape as being involved is given here . 1. KODAR DAM: First case of financial impropriety  was filed in 1980-81 when the Kodar dam was under construction during Jogi’s collectorship in Raipur. This was when as IAS he was Collector and had not resigned from IAS to join politics. 2. HELP TO CIA: During his collectorship in Indore in 1981-85, he was accused  of stealing design papers from CAT, Indore (a defence installation) and selling them to the CIA. The charges were never proved but another charge of appropriating land belonging to Church of North India to build a colony was also instituted. 3. FAKE CERTIFICATE: Jogi’s ST certificate has been issued  by a Pendra tehsildar in 1967. All cases challenging it has been clubbed in the Bilaspur High Court, which will also decide whether the SC/ST Commission of India order proclaiming him an SC (and NOT an ST which he claims) is correct. 4. JUDEV SCAM: The CBI is investigating  the Judev VCD. It has tracked certain e-mails by Amit Jogi claiming to have carried out a Tehelka II. Along with Amit, Ajit Jogi is also alleged to have been behind the CD. We have seen CBI and Outlook showing their hands in Amit Jogi’s issues above. Ajit Jogi said a lot more about the Judeo CD than anyone would know. Immediately after Dilip Singh Judeo’s press conference in Raipur on 16 November 2003 (Sunday), Jogi had called a press meet where he said the money transaction had taken place in the Taj Hotel in New Delhi. He had also said the money paid to Judeo was more than what Bangaru Laxman had accepted from the Tehelka frontmen. However, neither the newspaper that broke the story nor cable news channels had given these specifications. Then how could Ajit Jogi have known this unless he had a hand in the entire episode? This was also alleged  by the BJP leader Arun Jaitley. Congress loyalist weekly Outlook also gave details  of Jogi father-son duo’s hands in the case. 5. In May 2011, there was a Lok Sabha bypoll to Bastar seat in Chhattisgarh. Ajit Jogi was caught  on camera distributing cash to voters at an election rally in Bastar, where LS by-poll was held on May 8. As a matter of fact, the LS bypoll was held due to death of sitting MP Baliram Kashyap, whose sons were killed by Naxals in September 2009. He was the man who Ajit Jogi tried to install as Chief Minister in December 2003 after losing polls by wooing some BJP MLAs through money and forming a government with Congress support in the infamous Cash-for-MLA case. 6. In July 2013 there were further reports of caste certificate of Jogi being fake. The Telegraph reported  that the Raman Singh-led BJP government is set to make public a report that says the Congress leader is not a tribal and possesses a fake caste certificate. The state government had set up a high-level, quasi-judicial body to look into Jogi’s caste certificate on a directive from the Supreme Court, which had found evidence on his caste inconclusive while dismissing a petition a few years ago. 7. Ajit Jogi is also accused of using forged documents while applying for petrol pumps in 1996said BJP spokesman, Prakash Javadekar,  Armed with this “document”, Nand Kumar Sai, the BJP’s candidate against Mr Jogi in the Mirwahi Assembly constituency in Chhattisgarh, in the 2003 polls filed  a case with the Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala Courts charging Jogi with cheating. 8. In April 2003 Ajit Jogi claimed to present an IB document as proof of ‘witch hunt’ by the then NDA government. But this document was also fake, and the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a charge sheet in October 2003 against Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi for using forged documents to tarnish the Intelligence Bureau’s image. In March 2003, Jogi had alleged that IB’s Special Directorate had launched an operation code-named ‘Black Sea’ to target opposition leaders in the run-up to the elections in Congress-ruled states. The IB all along has denied  that there was an operation codenamed ‘Black Sea’. 9. In November 2013, while campaigning before the Chhattisgarh polls, he said addressing tribals that they will get an ‘electric shock’ if they press any button than the Congress’ on the Electronic Voting Machine on the polling day while voting. This is on video recording. This is an offence- intimidating voters with fear and basically misguiding gullible tribals. He got a notice  from the Election Commission for this. 10. Ajit Jogi also used government aircraft for party President Sonia Gandhi’s work which is also not permitted. The Election Commission trained its ire on former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh for having used state government aircraft during the December Assembly elections but let off Congress president Sonia Gandhi lightly for a similar act. The Commission had issued a show-cause notice  to the Congress in Nov 2003 asking why it should not be de-recognised in the wake of its president Sonia Gandhi and Chhattisgarh chief minister and Speaker having used the Chhattisgarh government aircraft for travel while the model code of conduct was in force. The Commission directed the Congress that it must reimburse within 30 days either from its own funds or by recovering from Mr Jogi the total costs of the seven flights undertaken by him and the two flights taken by Ms Gandhi in the Chhattisgarh government aircraft. These are legal cases. But there are several other doubts and suspicions on Jogi also. He also said  as Chhattisgarh CM in February 2003 that tribals are not Hindus. He said that any religion the tribals embrace is their first, and thus it is not conversion if they become Christians! He had the audacity to say this, as Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh! The Congress, which is claiming to be ‘more-Hindu-than-you’ has never once condemned Jogi for this statement, nor has it given any clarification on it, on whether it thinks that tribals are Hindus or not. Rahul Gandhi, who famously tore up an ordinance of the UPA Government aimed at saving the tainted, has all along kept a deafening silence on all the above issues. And he had the audacity to give MLA tickets to both Ajit and Amit Jogi in the December 2013 Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh! Today, CPI and BSP are allies of the Jogis, and they too have no answer on the antics of their alliance partners. The role of the media in all this is also of course, reprehensible. It allowed the Congress to go scot-free on the issue of Amit Jogi’s 3 different versions of birth certificate for as many as 3 years after 2013 until 2016 when the Jogis were in the party.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a rally in poll-bound Chhattisgarh today hit out on ‘Urban Maoists’  who sit in their air-conditioned luxury homes while the Adivasis suffer and said that Congress is busy standing by these ‘Urban Maoists’. His jibe, though, has not gone down too well with the Congress-friendly journalists who were visibly rattled. The PM hadn’t named anyone, but some were quick to guess whom he meant. After all, how can anyone who gives up their American citizenship ever be in the wrong? She was explained by a helpful Twitter user that a lot of these ‘Urban Naxals’ are actually quite rich and it would be more profitable for them to give up their American citizenship. However, not to give up easily, Twitter user Mihir Jha was persistent. And then there were the ones who thought they’d be witty to say that PM Modi implied Ambanis. Perhaps Bal forgot that the Ambanis are far from the communist ideology. The term ‘Urban Maoist ‘ and ‘Urban Naxals’ is usually used to refer to those who live in the cities and are most of the times engaged in gainful employment, mostly in the academics or in the media, who engage in leadership, provide supplies, technologies, expertise, information and logistic support. Recently, in a massive crackdown, residences of prominent ‘civil rights activists’ were raided . The arrests were in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence from last year as well as a plot to assassinate PM Modi. In OpIndia’s exclusive interview  with surrendered Naxal Pahad Singh, he had categorically stated that it is these Urban Naxals who are responsible for the menace of Naxalism and the blood-shed of Adivasis. He had asserted that he personally saw Arun Ferreira  in a meeting of the top echelon of CPI Maoists, a banned terror outfit.

He added that only poor and underprivileged were targeted by the demonetisation move while the rich and wealthy escaped unscathed. Countering Rahul Gandhi, BJP spokesperson Dr Sambit Patra, while addressing the media, quipped  that he has seen the Congress president Rahul Gandhi alighting  from his luxurious car worth Rs 4 crores to withdraw his money from the ATMs. He alleged that for 10 long years in the government, Congress was in Dhritrashtra mode against these corrupt shell companies, turning a blind eye against them but as soon as they were hurt from the demonetisation move, Rahul Gandhi started shedding tears for them. Extolling demonetisation’s benefits, Patra said that it was a positive move towards formalisation of the economy which was hitherto largely informal in nature. The move significantly augmented the tax base  and there was a marked advancement of Digitalisation of the economy after demonetisation. Patra asserted that over 2 lakh shell companies that existed during the 10 years Congress was at the centre from 2004 to 2014 were closed  down immediately after demonetisation. “The Naxalites were worst hit by demonetisation but those who view them as ‘revolutionaries’  will certainly not like demonetisation owing to its disastrous ramifications on Naxals”, he quipped.

The Congress leader’s open call for ‘burning Modi alive’ is nothing less than a clear incitement to violence against the topmost leader of the country. Former Minister TB Jayachandra while talking  to media during a protest event staged against the NDA government for its decision to ban high-value currency through demonetisation on 8th November 2016, said that the day has come when we must burn Narendra Modi alive. Former Chief Minister and BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa reacted  to TB Jayachandra’s statements, said that Congress leaders have lost their mental balance and are issuing these hateful statements as they are intolerant towards PM Modi after seeing his rise. He further said that TB Jayachandra’s statement is a matter of shame and he should immediately apologise for statements, failing a defamation suit will be filed against the former Law Minister Jayachandra. However, the Congress leader when confronted  over his shameful remarks, brazened it out. “It’s his own statement, I am just reminding him. I said nothing wrong,” reportedly said the Congress leader.

The Tipu Sultan Jayanti celebrations planned by the Congress-JDS government in Karnataka has been met with severe protests and condemnations. After reports that several social groups and the BJP are planning to disrupt the state-sponsored celebrations, the government has imposed  section 144 in several places in the state. Section 144 has been imposed in Hubli, Dharwad and Shivamogga and several places in Kodagu. The curfew has been announced from 6 am on November 10 to 7 am on November 11. As the Congress-JDS government remains adamant on celebrating  the Tipu Sultan Jayanti, it is being said that CM Kumaraswamy will not be attending the festivities. BJP and several Hindu groups, especially of the Kodagu region have been protesting against the state-sponsored celebrations of the birth anniversary of the 18th-century ruler of Mysuru. The Congress government had started the Tipu Jayanti celebrations  from 2015 in the state. The BJP and Hindu groups like Sri Ram Sene and Hindu Janajaguti Samiti have opposed the state-sponsored event commemorating the 18th-century tyrant. BJP leader and MP Anant Kumar Hegde had clarified that he will not be attending the celebrations and had stated to the Karnataka government not to include his name in the list of invitees.

Rahul Gandhi’s party seems to come up with new ways to abuse the Prime Minister everyday. This time, Sanjay Nirupam, who has a history  of abusing PM Modi has once again created a controversy by saying in future Modi may blame Congress for his birth. Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam while addressing a protest rally  against the second anniversary of demonetisation said, “Narendra Modi, since the day he rose to power, has been blaming Congress party for every wrong thing that is happening in the country and in future PM Narendra Modi may say that Congress is the reason for his birth”. Sanjay Nirupam went on to say  that the people of the country will “politically” hang PM Modi in 2019 General Elections to take revenge against the hardships they suffered due to demonetisation. The Mumbai Congress had organised a rally in which controversial placards and banners were put up, quoting, “We are reminding the PM of his own statement when he said — Hang me if demonetisation is wrong”. Nirupam defended the posters by saying that this is the statement made by the Prime Minister and not by the Congress party. He went on to question PM Modi on his promise to give an account of demonetisation after 50 days. He cited Modi saying that if this decision is proven to be wrong, people can hang him publicly. “More than 600 days have passed now, but the prime minister has refrained from speaking about the decision of demonetisation ever since,” said Nirupam. This is not the first time that Sanjay Nirupam has used crass language. He had recently used foul language to refer PM Modi as ‘illiterate and uncouth’.

205,K Bhattacharjee,"The ideological framework that he operates under and his actions as Chief Minister since he took office reveals that his appointment as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was a great watershed moment for Indian politics, perhaps even more so than the 2014 General Elections. Yogi Adityanath, the Mahant of Gorakhnath Mutt and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, has captured the public imagination in a manner that is unprecedented even in the era of Narendra Modi. Already dubbed by many as Prime Minister Modi’s successor, the ruthlessness of the state police in dealing with criminals and his unabashed commitment to Sanatana Dharma has arguably made him the second most popular BJP leader after the Prime Minister himself. But how does Yogi Adityanath think? What is the ideological framework he operates under? Today, we shall make an effort to decipher the motivations that drive the Warrior Priest. It is well known that Yogi Adityanath’s preferred mode of defence, is attack. He has demonstrated time and again that he will not back down from a challenge and perceives as his duty to ensure the continued survival of the Hindu civilization. During his interviews, during the election campaign for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections and after, he has made no effort to hide his ideological inclinations and is completely unapologetic about the actions he has undertaken to fulfil ideological objectives. The central theme of Yogi Adityanath’s worldview appears to be his perception that the Hindu civilization as we know it is under threat from forces both within and without. An article on his official website titled ‘Hindus in danger’ states , “If we Hindus are to survive, then we must become aware, we have to recognize the forces that threaten our existence and we also have to identify our own strengths.” He goes on to warn, The secularization of Nepal appears to have affected Yogi Adityanath quite strongly. It is quite obvious that the Mahant perceives the declaration of Nepal as a secular state as an attack on Hinduism itself. In the same article, he writes, “The danger that looms over Nepal isn’t a threat to merely a country, it is a conspiracy to destroy a culture. Nepal is not merely a nation but a legacy.” In his article, ‘The ongoing Cheerharan of Nepal ‘, he elaborates on the issue and asserts that preserving Nepal’s identity as a Hindu nation is absolutely essential for Indian interests. He asserts that for as long as Nepal has existed, it has always been a Hindu country. And the attempts to secularize it was being made by vested interests as the country’s official designation as a Hindu Rashtra under a Hindu Monarchy was making it difficult for communists, Islamists and Christian missionaries to function freely. He also heavily criticized the Indian government at the time (the UPA regime) for its inaction and cited the chaos that Nepal was forced through as a great failure of Indian foreign policy. It is quite evident that Yogi Adityanath believes as long as Nepal remains a Hindu country, its government and administration will naturally be aligned to Indian interests and anything otherwise would affect the relationship between our countries adversely. Yogi Adityanath appears to have great regards for the erstwhile monarchy of Nepal and perceived the abolition of monarchy in the country as a great tragedy. “As long as the Monarchy existed, the Maoists could not create anarchy in the country and that is why in the name of democracy, the monarchy was abolished. Capturing power over the state is their only objective.” He also sees collaborations between Islamists, Christian missionaries and communists in the events that transpired in Nepal. It should also be mentioned that Yogi Adityanath has close personal ties with the erstwhile Nepalese royal family and his sampradaya has a huge following there. It is said that Prithvi Narayan Shah himself, who is credited to have waged the conquests that led to the formation of the modern Nepalese state, visited Gorakhnath Mutt and took the blessings of the Mahant before embarking on the path of war. Since then, every Nepalese monarch visited the Temple of Gorakhnath to seek His blessings. Yogi Adityanath asserts that Islam is a source of inspiration behind acts of terrorism. An article titled which is assumed to be written in the wake of the terror attacks at Jaipur in 2008, ‘Islam and Terrorism ‘ says, “There’s a section of Indian people who object when Islam is associated with terrorism. They call it a conspiracy to malign the religion. Aren’t they aware why not only in India but all over the world, the number of people killed in the name of Islam and Allah keeps on increasing? Why is the sacred land of Bharata being reddened with the blood of innocents? Why are innocent Hindus murdered on a daily basis? Why have Hindus been completely wiped out from Afghanistan? Why is it that the extermination of Hindus in Bangladesh is in its final phase? Why were Hindus wiped out in Pakistan occupied Kashmir? Why did the Kashmir valley turn anti-India as soon as Muslims became the majority and Hindus were wiped out?” The Yogi doesn’t buy into the idea that people are taking to terrorism due to lack of employment opportunities, according to him, there are some fundamental doctrines of Islam which inspire terrorism. In the same article, he says, “Till the time the ideas of Jihad and Jannat continue to exist, terrorism will not stop. Let us vow to eradicate the ideas of Jihad and Jannat from the face of the Earth, only then will Dharma and our culture survive and our pride will remain secure as well.” Yogi Adityanath’s vision of Hindutva is also worth noting. He calls those who deem Hindutva communal as silly. He says Hindus can never be communal. On the other hand, those who claim their religion to be the only true religion and deem the others false and assert that they should not even exist are actually the communal ones, says  the Yogi. “Hindutva is an inclusive movement for the nation’s renaissance whose objective is to eradicate evil traditions such as untouchability, casteism, dowry. It should also not be forgotten that despite so many obstacles and challenges if India has succeeded in remaining secular, it’s only because India is a Hindu-majority country.” Yogi also regards religious conversions as a conspiracy against the nation. “Dharma-antran is Rashtra-antran and is a conspiracy to destroy the culture of our nation,” he proclaims. He says  that Muslim invaders and Christian missionaries during the colonial era converted many many Hindus using terror, threats, bribes and even through deceit and later these very people were used as foot-soldiers in their war against Bharata. And he claims that such conspiracies continue to this day. He claims that Christian missionaries do not convert people to promote spiritual inquiry but for entirely political reasons. “After the conversion, efforts are made to change the nation the person identifies himself with. His beliefs are separated from the land of this country its culture. It is due to religious conversions that the northeastern states of India have come Christianized and have become hubs of separatism.” Illegal immigration is also a major concern for Yogi Adityanath. He accuses  the UPA regime of being motivated by selfish politics and blames state governments (most of which were not under BJP rule then) as well for their inability to check illegal immigration from Bangladesh which has altered the demography of many northeastern regions in the country. “Due to Bangladeshi illegal immigrants, every state in northeast India along with West Bengal and Bihar are suffering a dangerous situation of changing demography.” He also claims that anti-India forces are using Bangladeshi illegal immigrants to further their nefarious anti-national agenda. In the past, the revered leader of the Nath sampradaya has asserted that movies are selectively undermining Hindu culture. Citing examples of movies such as ‘Jodha Akbar’, the Yogi says  these are attempts at denigrating Hindu society and culture. He also calls such attempts ‘mischievous’. “Why don’t the filmmakers remember Maharana Pratap who swore that he shall not bow before any invader?” He further says, “We have to stop this mischief otherwise if such insult to the divine feminine continues, we have to prepare ourselves for another Mahabharata.” One of the things that have made Yogi Adityanath so popular is his completely unapologetic nature. In the past, he has made several statements which made him an immensely controversial figure in Indian politics. He had said  to those opposing Surya Namaskar during the International Yoga Day celebrations, “Sun is the source of life-giving energy. Whoever thinks Sun is communal, I would like to humbly request them to drown themselves in the sea or they should stay in a dark cell.” Of Mother Teresa, he had said , “Mother Teresa was part of a conspiracy to convert Hindus to Christianity. Hindus were targeted in the name of doing service and then converted by her.” His track record in the Parliament during his tenure as an MP from Gorakhpur speaks volumes about his commitment towards Hindutva. During a discussion on the 5151st anniversary of Bhagavad Geeta, he requested  that the Book, Holy to Hindus, be declared a national book and be made a part of the school, secondary and university education. On another occasion, he spoke out  against the Uttar Pradesh state government’s decision to take over the Shri Banke Bihari Temple and Shri Vindhanchal Shaktipeeth. He criticized  the then state government for not acting on the directions of the National Green Tribunal to shut down illegal slaughterhouses in the state, something which he took decisive action against after assuming the seat of Chief Minister. During his time as an MP, he also spoke out  against the banning of loudspeakers during Kanwaryatra and the harassment that the devotees endured due to their protests. After he became the Chief Minister, devotees have been greeted  with flowers from the air and DJs were permitted as well. He has also requested  that a law be formulated to ban cow slaughter in the entire country. In the Parliament, Yogi has asked several pointed questions as well. He asked  the government if it was aware that suspicious role of the Church was found behind separatism in the North East to which Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren RIjiju stated there was no such report. He has also asked  questions regarding activities of NGOs in tribal areas. He has spoken out  against the communal nature of RTE Act as well and demanded that the then UPA government stop dividing the country between the minority and the majority. The most glaring insight to Yogi Adityanath’s worldview was provided during his interview at Chunav Manch  ahead of the state assembly elections. When the interviewer pressed him about the names that had been restored in Uttar Pradesh and asked why he couldn’t he let the names just be, Yogi’s answer, instead of going on the defensive, was a straightforward, “Why should we let it be?” Then, he went on to assert that he will continue to restores the names of places and he indeed has proved true to his word in that regard thus far. During the same event, when someone from the audience accused him of practising communal politics and suggested that the country will benefit greatly if he chooses to retire from politics, Yogi retaliated by saying,”You have said a very good thing, if you have said the same thing in Kashmir, if we had sent you there as a counsellor, then it would have been great.” When Muslim women attacked him, he went on the offensive and asserted that they should try convincing Maulvis and Maulanas to issue a fatwa against Triple Talaq instead. Yogi Adityanath appears to be one of those people who recognize the Indian state as the custodian of the great Hindu civilization and to ensure the continued existence of it as its duty. Coupled with his combative attitude, the saffron-clad saint is a very potent mix of ideological fortitude, the strength of character and righteous conviction in the path that he has embarked upon. The ideological framework that he operates under and his actions as Chief Minister since he took office reveals that his appointment as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was a great watershed moment for Indian politics, perhaps even more so than the 2014 General Elections. More importantly, the decisions he has taken thus far hints towards the fact that he has not deviated from his ideological positions which he had endorsed prior to his appointment as Chief Minister of the most populous state in India.

According to a report  in the Times Now, the Delhi CM has left for Dubai with his wife Sunita Kejriwal on a private trip. Reportedly, Kejriwal has taken an Air India flight to Dubai last night. The report claims that power minister Satyendra Kumar had also taken a week-long trip to Dubai recently. The Delhi government is, however, maintaining complete silence over the trip and not giving any information to the media, the report added. Many people have expressed their displeasure at the CM leaving for a foreign trip while the city is struggling with hazardous levels of air pollution. Former AAP leader Kapil Mishra has also criticised the timing and secrecy of the CM’s trip. It is notable here that Delhi’s air pollution has remained in ‘severe’ category since a couple of days. The Delhi government has been criticised on several occasions for its failure to curb air pollution levels. Last year, it was revealed that the Kejriwal government had been sitting on Rs 787 crores of environment cess  collected and had been busy bickering with the CMs of the neighbouring states while Delhi’s air remained toxic.

Tej Pratap Yadav had gone to Ranchi to discuss with his father regarding his separation  from his wife and has not returned to Patna. According to the reports , sources close to his family has said that Tej Pratap left mid-way to an unknown location on his way back home from Ranchi to Patna. MLA Kumar Sarvjeet said that he met his father for a couple of hours at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in Ranchi on Saturday and left the city on Monday afternoon claiming to return back to Patna. “I met Yadav, along with other party leaders, over dinner Sunday. He was looking exhausted. He bid us goodbye Monday, saying he was returning home. I have the knowledge of his movements only till his departure from the Royal Residency hotel,” said Kumar Sarvjeet. According to another report , Tej Pratap managed to escape on Monday by dodging his security guards at the hotel in Bodh Gaya, where he had checked in on Sunday. The guards were posted at the main door of the hotel, while he left the hotel through another door. He escaped in his car with his driver, leaving behind the security guards. The guards realised he is not in the hotel only when the local MLA came to meet Tej Pratap in the evening. Tej Pratap Yadav after meeting his father had said  that he stands by his decision to get a divorce from his wife, Aishwarya Rai to whom he was married just six months back. “No person can live a stifled life,” he had reportedly said regarding his marriage life. “I was never ready for the wedding. I kept pleading my parents and also discussed my feelings with my brother Tejashwi and sisters but no one took me seriously,” said Yadav before leaving for Ranchi to meet his father who is serving a jail term there. Tej Pratap had claimed that he was made a scapegoat  for the political benefits of his family members. Rai is the daughter of a former minister, Chandrika Rai and granddaughter of former BJP chief minister Daroga Rai. Yadav, a Class 12th fail, had described his marriage to Aishwarya Rai, a DU graduate as a ‘mismatch’. He had said that while he is a simple man with a simple lifestyle, wife Aishwarya is a modern woman used to a life of a metropolis. Tej Pratap Yadav had previously said he was upset and had hinted that everything is not going well  with his younger brother Tejashwi, who has emerged as the party’s de facto leader in their father’s absence. Tej Pratap has always managed to be in the news for his behaviour and activities. On occasions, he had dressed up  as Krishna or Lord Shiva.

212,Shashank Bharadwaj,"After the loss of Bellary by-elections, the BJP may defend the results by portraying it as a loss of mere one Lok Sabha seat, but it is not that simple anymore. The BJP should realise that the by-poll victory of the ruling alliance in Karnataka may serve as a template for other strong regional parties to come together to form a similar alliances While delivering a speech  at Gadag recently, Congress ‘Man Friday’ and troubleshooter DK Shivakumar, in what seems to be a late realisation had personally apologized for Siddaramaiah led Congress government’s decision to create a Lingayath-Veerashaiva divide  ahead of the Karnataka state elections. The BJP leaders including former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa rejoiced it, as they thought that this was another self-goal by the Congress ahead of the crucial by-polls, which could lead to Lingayath consolidation against the Congress. But, what followed was entirely opposite of what BJP had thought. By the time BJP realized its mistake of falling into yet another trap set by DK Shivakumar, the BJP had already lost the by-poll battle. The recent by-polls result could be an indicator of what’s coming in Karnataka politics for next one year. I want to particularly discuss the Bellary by-polls and the coming together of erstwhile political adversaries such as former Prime Minister HD Devegowda, former CM Siddararamaih, who one time was considered to be Devegowda’s political heir and most importantly Congress’s strategist DK Shivakumar. The Bellary by-polls can give us a hint on the direction of politics in the state of Karnataka and why it is a great setback for the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in the state next year. The Bellary by-poll results give us some interesting details regarding the rise of strong coalitions and its impact on BJP’s Karnataka prospects in the elections ahead. Bellary-once a Congress bastion, lost to BJP’s mining barons, Reddy brothers in 2004 and Congress rose to control it yet again in 2018 after it secured 6 out of 8 seats in the assembly elections. The BJP built it and turned it not only to a fortress but also into a power centre during BJP’s rule in the state in 2008. The victory of Congress–JDS coalition in the Bellary Lok Sabha gives us a clear picture of the how Congress-JDS if combined, can take the battle to the BJP in the upcoming elections. The astounding victory of the Congress-JDS is also a result of an inability of the BJP to function as a strong opposition party to challenge the ruling alliance in the state because of a severe leadership crisis in state BJP. If the Congress-JDS coalition government is as united as today and contests as an alliance in the upcoming general elections with Karnataka BJP being disoriented as it is now, the saffron party is set to be doomed in the state. The Congress-JDS combined has the leadership ability, resources and more importantly the ability of the leadership to harness the caste politics to garner a much larger vote share than BJP. On the other hand, BJP has relied too much on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its President Amit Shah, as it was evident in the recently concluded assembly elections in May; where PM Modi had to single-handedly save the party from facing severe defeat. The Congress-JDS has worked out careful caste calculations with effective social engineering by uniting leaders from varied caste to neutralize BJP’s Hindutva vote base, which is not that particularly strong in the south relative to North Indian states barring few coastal districts in the state. The Congress-JDS leaders are very much aware that issues like Ram Mandir, Hindutva or strong economy and to some extent even issues like surgical strikes will have a very limited impact in the state ahead. The prominent Vokkaliga leaders like DK Shivakumar, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy are heavily backing the Vokkaliga vote base (11 percent vote share) along with the minority votes which is around 16 percent in the state. The Lingayaths, who are about 14 percent and Dalits around 20 percent in the state, have been careful regarding their choice and can decide the fate of the next Lok Sabha elections, as they did in the Bellary by-polls. With state BJP crumbling, the caste calculations and state level alliance between Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) can fetch a good number of seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The intense squabbling in the BJP ranks has devoid the party from creating an able leadership to face the formidable Congress-JDS state leadership. While R Ashok, a prominent Vokkaliga leader of BJP, openly flaunts his closeness to fellow Vokkaliga leaders DK Shivakumar and HD Kumaraswamy, leaders like KS Eashwarappa and Jagadish Shettar, despite their inability to lead, indulge in politics to counter BSY. The BJP also seems to be stuck in ‘Lingayath-Veerashaiva’ hangover, evident in the recent by-polls by sticking to ailing BS Yeddyurappa who neither has the fire to motivate the party workers nor any organizational skills left to sweep elections. The BJP, however, did try with its fiery leader Ananth Kumar Hegde, who belongs to Upper caste, but soon realized that he had a very limited role to play in the state politics with huge caste dimensions. The BJP’s battle for power in the state can only come from effective leadership, unlike other states, especially in North India, where RSS has much clout with its strong organizational penetration. In states like Karnataka, it is only strong leadership with effective caste calculations can ensure victory to either side. The Congress-JDS seems to be at a very comfortable for now compared to the BJP. Six months before the election, Congress-JDS are at a favourable position to take on the BJP, but six months is a very long time in politics especially at the time of crucial general elections. The BJP can still secure around 15-18 seats in the Lok Sabha elections with the proper reorganization of state unit and most importantly resolving issue pertaining to the leadership crisis within the party which could also resolve some bitter internal rifts. The BJP needs to be united to fight a much stronger Congress-JDS coalition. Knowingly or unknowingly, the BJP has also brought two of the fiercest political opponents of the state-Former PM HD Devegowda and former CM Siddaramaiah, the former once being the godfather of the latter. The duo can cause severe damage to BJP in Old Mysore region and Central Karnataka where BJP had performed well in the last Lok Sabha elections. Karnataka politics is as much complex as Uttar Pradesh or Bihar politics because of its sensitive caste dynamics and presence of strong regional parties. The BJP which had won 17 seats from Karnataka in the 2014 elections will be facing one of its toughest fights ahead just to retain its vote base. The BJP national leadership should immediately address the issue concerning the state leadership and evolve an effective strategy to counter the Congress-JDS hegemony in the state. The BJP has to push hard in whatever they do, as it is extremely important for them not to lose Karnataka, which they consider to be the ‘gateway’ to other southern states. After the loss of Bellary by-elections, the BJP may defend the results by portraying it as a loss of mere one Lok Sabha seat, but it is not that simple anymore. The BJP should realise that the by-poll victory of the ruling alliance in Karnataka may serve as a template for other strong regional parties to come together to form a similar alliance ahead of the general elections. The agenda-less Congress is so desperate to join hands with any strong regional parties to fight the BJP at a ‘constituency-level’ to counter BJP’s ‘Modi vs Rest’ narrative. The BJP should rework its strategies to not only stitch better alliances but also to counter the regional satraps joining hands with Congress. The strong regional parties and the choices of coalitions they make will be the underlying theme of the elections ahead in the country.",2018-11-08,"2019 general elections,2019 lok sabha elections,BJP,by-polls,Congress,Congress-JDS,DK Shivkumar,karnataka,mahagathbandhan,modi government,Narendra Modi,PM Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,RSS,UPA,yeddyurappa","Ruling Congress-JDS alliance is here to stay, BJP should wake up or get doomed in Karnataka",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/ruling-congress-jds-alliance-is-here-to-stay-bjp-should-wake-up-or-get-doomed-in-karnataka/
213,Ashish Shukla,"Those who profess by Dr Singh for his honesty and integrity must be told the difference between the two traits. You are honest if you told your wife you cheated. But you lack integrity when you cheat on your wife, nevertheless. Honesty is convenient; integrity is the stuff a man is made of. Does Manmohan Singh care about India or Congress? This thought flashed across my mind when I heard the great-mumbler talk  about secular, plural, free and equal India under threat as he turned up for the launch of Shashi Tharoor’s book in the Capital last week. If he cared about India, he would’ve earned the gratitude of a billion-plus Indians by stepping down as Prime Minister while his party spawned a million scams. He would’ve done more than offer a mere apology for the 1984 Sikh genocide and certainly made sure he didn’t share the same stage  with Sajjan Kumar, a prime accused as 3000 Sikhs were lynched in the Capital. He would’ve addressed his countrymen at important junctures of his 10-year rule and not been a mere statue who didn’t react even as Rahul Gandhi tore up  his government’s ordinance and humiliated him in public. Such a background of his is not in consonance with his daily tirade against communal violence and mob lynching that he accuses  have become widespread under the regime of Narendra Modi. It is also strange that he would, today, call Demonetisation ‘organised loot and legalised plunder’ when he himself presided over the worst scams India has ever witnessed. If he cared about India, he would’ve confessed to the citizens that the worst 18 communal riots  in independent India’s history came while his party was in power. Six of the worst  communal riots occurred while Dr Singh was the Prime Minister. In 2012, there were 640 incidents of communal violence. A year later, the number was 473 in 2013. As for lynchings which has Dr Singh most upset about, he showed no such remorse when several lives were lost to mob-lynchings during his tenure. This doesn’t seem a man in love with India. This is the picture of a dishonest man who yearns for a secular, plural and equal India but wouldn’t utter a word about Kashmiri Pundits who have been driven out of their own land. His plurality beats a hasty retreat when Hindus face communally marginalization in states such as Bengal and Kerala. He bemoans Kathua and Unnao but has no time for unfortunate rapes in Uri  or in a Madrasa . He would rather have a secret dinner  with a top Pakistani politician than make a point to them about martyred soldiers and their unfortunate widows, victims of terrorism from across the border.

214,OpIndia Staff,"Madhavan also informed that in the upcoming purchase of 110 fighter jets by India, HAL will have to be selected as a partner by any company that wins the deal.  At a time when Congress president Rahul Gandhi can’t stop accusing that Narendra Modi government has ‘snatched’ a ₹ 30,000 crore offset business in the Rafale deal from HAL and given it to Anil Ambani’s Reliance, HAL chairman has told that the company is not after such offset deals. In an exclusive interview  with journalist Manu Pubby and published on the Economic Times, HAL chairman R Madhavan said that the public sector company was not a contender for offset business in the deal to buy 36 Rafale jets. R Madhavan had taken over as Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited on September 1, after the term of previous CMD T Suvarna Raju was over. Madhavan also said that the company has asked its employees to not get involved with any political party on the issue. On the Rafale deal, he said, “our message is clear — please do not bring HAL into it”. He said that the company does not want to get involved in the issue because it has a negative impact on HAL. He reminded that even the worker unions of the company have issued statements that they don’t want to be part of any controversy on the issue. On October 13, Rahul Gandhi wanted to address HAL employees in the company premises, but both HAL authorities and employee unions refused  this meet. Later, Rahul Gandhi had addressed some current and former employees outside the company premises. The HAL CMD said that the company is not in the offset business. He said the company is into manufacturing of aircraft, and transfer of technology and production are not the same as offsets. While some offset business may come to HAL, that is not a priority for the company. “In fact, we are not even contending for the offsets. We do not plan, for example, to have a line to make a foreign civilian jet. Our prime business is manufacturing, not offsets”, he added. It can be noted that the Dassault Reliance joint venture, which is the prime target of Rahul Gandhi, is currently making parts for the Falcon business jet, which is a civilian plane made by Dassault. Commenting on HAL’s own capability of making fighter planes, Madhavan said that although the company may lack the capacity to make enough planes on time, their capability and technical expertise can’t be questioned. He said that HAL has partnered with four private sector companies for the manufacture of the LCA Tejas, these private companies will be making almost the entire structure of the plane, while HAL will only do the final integration. The HAL chief said that the company would like to focus on design, integration, flight testing and support. Madhavan also informed that in the upcoming purchase of 110 fighter jets by India, HAL will have to be selected as a partner by any company that wins the deal. There is a requirement of 40% indigenisation in that order, and only HAL has the capability for that. On November 2, Madhavan had said  that HAL has started a major expansion of its manufacturing facilities and controversies around that Rafale deal has not affected the morale of its employees. He had informed media that the company has an order book of ₹64,000 crore which will be executed in four years. To achieve this, the company will be investing ₹1,400 crore during the financial year 2018-19 to scale up its facilities.

215,OpIndia Staff,"Mizo organisations and Congress government don't want the Bru refugees living in Tripura to be allowed to vote in Mizoram election. Local political groups and NGOs in Mizoram have called off  their agitation against Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of the state SB Shashank on Wednesday after he left for Delhi. Amid rising protest against the CEO, including from the Congress government, the Election Commission has summoned Shashank to Delhi. Several organisations in Mizoram, under the umbrella body NGO Co-ordination Committee, have been demanding the removal of Shashank from the state ahead of assembly elections scheduled for 28living   November. The centre of the contention is voting rights of Bru people from Mizoram currently lodged in refugee camps in neighbouring Tripura. More than thirty thousand people are  These people are still voters in Mizoram, and during last assembly and parliament elections, the election commission had set up facilities for them to vote inside Tripura. But this was protested by Mizo organisations, and the Congress government. After that, the EC had made a commitment that in future votes for Mizoram will take place only in Mizoram. For the upcoming election, the election commission had taken up revision of electoral roll of Bru refugees in Tripura, and they were planning to set up poll booths at a border town in Mizoram for them. But the Mizo organisations were not supporting this move. They argued that only those who have returned to Mizoram should be allowed to vote. A principal secretary-level officer in Mizoram, Lalnunmawia Chuaungo was allegedly interfering in the electoral roll updating process for the Bru people. On a complaint from the CEO, the EC had removed  Chuaungo from his post week. CEO Shashank had said that Chuaungo interfering in the election process and security arrangements for the polls, adding that Mizoram government did not seem keen to have any new Bru voter enrolled. A Gujarat cadre IAS officer, Chuaungo is a Mizo man, and he was supported by the Mizo organisations in the effort to prevent Bru voters from voting in the elections. This was another reason for their demand for removal of Shashank. On Monday, Mizoram CM Lal Thanhawla wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that removal of Shashank was the “only solution” for conducting the polls smoothly. Despite supporting the protesters, the CM himself was unable to file his nomination form in Serchhip as the returning officer’s office was gheraoed by protesters. As the protests intensified, the Election Commission had sent a three-member delegation on Tuesday to meet the representatives of the protesting organisations. But the meeting remained inconclusive and the protesters didn’t budge from their position. On Wednesday morning they resumed their agitation in front of the CEO’s office. Amid all this tension, the Election Commission decided to summon  Shashank to Delhi, and he left Mizoram on Wednesday itself. After news of his departure, the civil society decided to call off its agitation. Shashank is meeting the officials of the poll panel today in Delhi. He does not know whether he will return to Mizoram or he will be removed from his post, the CEO said before leaving. He said that he was simply carrying out his duties as per instructions of EC and he has no intention to hurt the sentiments of local people in Mizoram. Shashank also said that reports of Bru refugees being allowed to vote inside their camps in Tripura is just a rumour, and EC was yet to take a final decision on the matter. With just 20 days to go before the assembly election, the Election Commission will have to resolve the matter very soon to ensure a smooth election.",2018-11-08,"2018 Assembly Elections,central government,Election,election commission,Mizoram,mizoram assembly elections,North-East",Mizoram: Agitation against CEO called off after the Election Commission summons him to Delhi,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/mizoram-agitation-against-ceo-called-off-after-the-election-commission-summons-him-to-delhi/
216,K Bhattacharjee,"We should know better than giving that power away to political parties whose sole objective is winning elections. ""We do not want the government to control our Temples! But the government deciding how many children I should have makes perfect sense!"" It's ridiculous. In recent times, the demand for a population control law has been gaining momentum. Various people, primarily from the ‘Right-wing’ have attributed the cause of many issues that we face today to overpopulation. While I have no reason to doubt the honest intentions of those advocating for such a law, I believe they are profoundly misguided and thinking very short-term. Regardless of any political differences that we might have, giving a government, any government, the power to decide how many children one should have could have catastrophic consequences. No government should have that much power, no government should be able to determine the number of children its citizens should have. Decisions limiting procreation are not for the government to make. The concerns regarding population control is motivated largely, it appears, by the growing rate of Muslim population in the country. Prashant Patel Umrao, writing for Organiser, states , “Bharat has the third largest Muslim population next to Indonesia and Pakistan. We’re home to 10 per cent of the world’s Muslim community with 172 million Muslims (2011 census). There is a threat not only to the economic stability of our nation but also to social fabric due to the future disproportionate growth of Population. The other communities, on the other hand, understand the simple logic that limited resources can be ideally shared when there are fewer members. They believe in giving their children quality life. So encouraging them to procreate more won’t help at all. In such a situation the feasible option left is a coherent approach to holding back the population explosion which we severely lack. The disproportionately high population would be seriously baffling for our nation, leading to a high crime rate, tarnishing the social fabric, creating chaos in entire administration and thus cascading grave problems; burdening the government and our limited resources. So population control law becomes imperative in the national interest.” I understand that these are not entirely misplaced concerns as an unstable religious demography is a recipe for chaos for any country. However, it is the one thing that a population control law will never solve. The secular state has shown time and again that it is unwilling to implement laws equitably against the minority community. For instance, a non-bailable warrant was issued  against Shahi Imam Bukhari in 2013 by a local court for not appearing before the court for violation of the model code of conduct but he was never arrested. Sometimes, authorities have to rope in Maulvis and Maulanas to even ensure  that Muslims do not commit power theft and pay their bills on time. Under such circumstances, it’s extremely naive to assume that Muslims will be forced to obey any population control law. If the expectation is that the entire might of the state machinery will be used to implement the said order, then it’s naivete of the highest order. Just compare the intensity with which the Indian police is dealing with those bursting firecrackers in Diwali and the manner in which the Police abdicated their responsibility of providing security to citizens at all costs when Muslim mobs rampaged across the streets of West Bengal against Hindus. The Indian state cannot even deport illegal immigrants from the country and certain people expect them to enforce a population control law, it is quite ridiculous. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the political party you favour will stay in power forever. Therefore, any political party that perceives the minority community as its vote-bank will turn a blind eye when they break the population control law and selectively enforce it against Hindus with the objective of enlarging their own vote-bank at the expense of another party. The selective enforcement of the law against Hindus is likely to happen anyway regardless of which political party in power considering the track record of the Indian state. Seriously, a state whose administration has to rope in clerics to ensure the payment of electric bills and discourage electricity theft cannot be expected to strictly enforce the population control law which will obviously incur far more retaliation. Other reasons cited for such a law include corruption and increasing competition for limited resources in the future. These arguments are not based on objective observable facts either. There are more than seven billion people living in the world at this moment and we are far richer, far more prosperous than any human civilization has ever been in recorded history. Fatalists have often argued in the past that the population explosion would cause humans to go extinct by 2000, they have all proven to be hilariously off target. India’s problem is not overpopulation and really, what are the objective standards by which we measure what overpopulation is? India is not uniformly populated. There are areas where the population density is far more than it should be but the cause of it is rapid urbanization and the opportunities that urbanization presents. Rural India is fairly sparsely populated. Why should Arunachal Pradesh which had a population density of 17 in 2011 be made to pay for the fact that Delhi’s population density was over eleven thousand? It is preposterous to think there is a possibility of anything good coming of the proposed population control law. The Rightwing has been vociferously criticizing the Judiciary for issuing unimplementable judgments and yet they are advocating for a law that is harebrained from the very offset. It is potentially catastrophic. Just as atheists shouldn’t have the right to enter Temples by violating its traditions, you should not have the right either to decide how many children others can have. We should know better than giving that power away to political parties whose sole objective is winning elections. “We do not want the government to control our Temples! But the government deciding how many children I should have makes perfect sense!” It’s ridiculous. How else do we stop the fast-changing demographic shift underway due to the minority community having far too many children? I do not know. But the solution is surely not preventing Hindus from having as many kids as they want to. The population control law will provide political parties with the opportunity to legally engineer a populace that is more viable to its own interests. They can effectively manufacture an electorate that is more suited to their own interests. That is not a power that we want to give any political party. Such a law could and would spell doom for the nation if it is ever implemented and we should all refrain from advocating for a such a misguided proposition.",2018-11-08,"demographic shift,demography,Hindu Majority,minority appeasement,Muslim Population,Politics,Population,population control",The Population Control Law being advocated by people is harebrained and will prove to be catastrophic,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/the-population-control-law-being-advocated-by-people-is-harebrained-and-will-prove-to-be-catastrophic/

A worker of the Communist Party of India (CPI) was killed  by Naxals in Sukma district of poll-bound Chhattisgarh on Wednesday afternoon, according to PTI. The victim Kalmu Dhruva’s wife is a sarpanch of the Bodko village. “According to villagers, he was brutally beaten to death with sticks by the ultras”, said Sukma Superintendent of Police Abhishek Meena. The Naxals have called for a boycott of the Assembly elections. 18 constituencies in eight Naxal-affected districts, Bastar, Kanker, Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur, Kondagaon and Rajnandgaon, have polls on November 12. According to reports , Dhruva’s brother was also killed by the Naxals two months ago. He had fled to Andhra Pradesh due to the fear of being killed by the Naxals. He was killed when he returned. The two brothers were on the target of the Naxals for a long time as they were suspected of spying on them. A few days ago the Centre had ordered  the tightening of security in the state based on the inputs from the intelligence agencies about ‘assiduous preparations’ of Naxals to interrupt the two-phase elections.

218,K Bhattacharjee,"In the secular state of India, it is perfectly acceptable for intellectuals and political parties to demonize entire Hindu castes for sins that were committed by their ancestors when they were not even alive and themselves had absolutely no part in and yet, celebrate tyrants who took intense pleasure in forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. These were the words of Tipu Sultan spoken to the Governor of Bekal (near Kasaragod) in a letter in 1790. This is the man whose birth anniversary the Congress-JD(S) government in Karnataka is hell-bent on celebrating. Tipu’s atrocities  aren’t limited to only that of course. He had conquered Kodagu through treachery after being unable to defeat them Kodavas in the field of battle. Beleaguered by the guerrilla warfare tactics employed by the Hindus to thwart his attacks, Tipu is said to have proclaimed, “If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honour every one of you with Islam”. Eventually, Tipu defeated the Kodavas after making an offer of friendship. When the Hindus of Kodagu accepted the offer of friendship and welcomed him to their land, the treacherous Sultan attacked them when they were most vulnerable. What followed was a complete rout. Hundreds and thousands were captured and forced to either convert to Islam or were tortured and put to death. Tipu himself stated  in another letter, “We proceeded with the utmost speed, and, at once, made prisoners of 40,000 occasion-seeking and sedition-exciting Coorgis, who alarmed at the approach of our victorious army, had slunk into woods, and concealed themselves in lofty mountains, inaccessible even to birds. Then carrying them away from their native country, we raised them to the honour of Islam, and incorporated them into our Ahmedy corps.” In 1788, in a letter to Abdul Kadir, Tipu says, “Over 12,000 Hindus were ‘honoured’ with Islam. There were many Namboodiris (Brahmins) among them. This achievement should be widely publicised among the Hindus. There the local Hindus should be brought before you and then converted to Islam. No Namboodiri (Brahmin) should be spared. Also, they should be confined there till the dress materials sent for them, reach you.” In another letter in 1790 to Syed Abdul Dulai, the tyrant asserts, “With the grace of Prophet Muhammed and Allah, almost all Hindus in Calicut are converted to Islam. Only a few are still not converted on the borders of Cochin State. I am determined to convert them also very soon. I consider this as Jehad to achieve that object.” There have been many other recorded instances where Tipu had committed severe atrocities against Hindus. The Mysore Gazetteer asserts that over 8000 Hindu Temples were destroyed across South India by Tipu and his army. In his article , “Tipu Sultan: As known in Kerala”, Ravi Verma mentions several Temples which were destroyed by Tipu. Some of them were Triprangot, Thrichembaram, Thirunavaya, Thiruvannoor, Calicut Thali, Hemambika Temple, the Jain Temple in Palghat, Mammiyur, Parambatali, Venkitangu, Pemmayanadu, Tiruvanjikulam, Terumanam, Vadakhumnnathan Temple of Trichur, Belur Siva Temple, Shri Veliyanattukava, Varakkal, Puthu, Govindapuram, Keraladhiswara, Trikkandiyur, Sukapuram, Maranehei Temple of Aaalvancheiri Tambrakkal, Vengara Temple of Aranadu, Tikulam, Ramanathakra, Azhinjalam Indiannur, Mannur Narayan Kanniar and Vadukunda Siva Temple of Madai. One especially brutal description of Tipu’s cruelty is mentioned by the famous traveller and historian, Fra Bartolomaco, in his well-known book, Voyage to East India. A verbatim description of events by a Christian victim in the book is as follows: “First a corps of 30,000 barbarians who butchered everybody on the way, followed by the Field-Gun Unit under the French Commander, M. Lally. Tipu Sultan was riding on an elephant behind which another army of 30,000 soldiers followed. Most of the men and women were hanged in Calicut. First mothers were hanged with children tied to the necks of their mothers. That barbarian Tipu Sultan tied the naked Christians and Hindus to the legs of elephants and made the elephants move about till the bodies of the helpless victims were tom to pieces. Temples and Churches were ordered to be burnt, desecrated and destroyed. Christian and Hindu women were forced to marry Muhammadans and similarly their men were forced to marry Muhammadan women. Those Christians who refused to be ‘honoured’ with Islam, were ordered to be killed by hanging then and there. The above version of the atrocities was obtained from the sorrowful narration by the victims who escaped from Tipu’s army and reached Varapuzha (near Alwaye) which is the centre of Carmichael Christian Mission. I myself helped many victims to cross the Varapuzha river by boats” (Cited in  Tipu Sultan committed the most despicable of atrocities against Hindus, and Christians as well. And yet, it appears acceptance of Tipu Sultan as a hero has become another litmus test for secularism in India after Aurangzeb. One is forced to wonder, why is it that the Indian secular state is so desperate to lionize tyrants and whitewash the crimes of mass murderers in order to feel good about its secularism? Meanwhile, Union Minister Ananth Kumar Hegde has condemned the decision of the state government’s decision to celebrate Tipu Sultan’s birthday and has made it clear that he will not appreciate an invitation to the event. An argument that is often provided in defence of Tipu is that he fought against the British. It seems pretty ridiculous that one has to say it so explicitly but not everyone who fought the British was a saint or worthy of celebration. Adolf Hitler fought the British as well, that for sure doesn’t make him worthy of being celebrated by anyone. Jinnah was against the British as well and only a person with the IQ of a 2-year-old baboon will make the argument that Indians should celebrate his legacy as well. More importantly, Tipu fought to retain his own Empire, neither his values are not consistent with our own nor were his motives honourable enough to garner appreciation. It’s an indictment of our secular state that we choose to celebrate tyrants whose primary legacy is the oppression of Hindus. The predominant belief that dominates the worldview of the Indian intellectual elites is that India began from a blank slate on the 15th of August, 1947, severing every tie with its Hindu past. That is the primary reason why when we look around today, Hindu traditions are under attack on every front, our festivals are under attack while political parties, especially one that claims to have a Janeudhari Hindu as its President, feel completely at ease celebrating tyrants who oppressed Hindus. That is primarily due to the nature of our constitution that refuses to recognize the exclusive Hindu nature of India. In the secular state of India, it is perfectly acceptable for intellectuals and political parties to demonize entire Hindu castes for sins that were committed by their ancestors when they were not even alive and themselves had absolutely no part in and yet, celebrate tyrants who took intense pleasure in forcibly converting Hindus to Islam. People are being arrested for celebrating Diwali in the manner they have for years and yet, it is completely acceptable to celebrate bigots.

But not covering a bridge inauguration by the CM of a union territory is not something one can fault them for. Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has inspired Congress President  Rahul Gandhi who was already drawing inspiration  from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But now Arvind Kejriwal has process begun  them all. Two years after the  Now, Trump’s pure, unadulterated hatred for media is quite well-known. Especially for CNN. He mentions how media is inaccurately reporting what he is saying, doing and everything else about him. He is also regularly pointing out how people close to him are targeted by everyone wrongly. He also regularly likes to tell the world that despite him doing all great things, the media is showing him in a bad light. Taking a leaf out of Donald Trump’s books, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has slowly Trumpified. Today he has said how the media had ‘blacked out’ his yesterday’s speech. In his words, it was done because he was ‘challenging Modiji’s politics’. In reality, he was inaugurating a ‘bridge’ which took fourteen years to finally materialise. A chief minister of a state inaugurating a bridge. Then, like Trump, he goes and questions the media whether their behaviour that they reported the fact AAP MLA pushed a BJP MP  who was standing there was okay. And then questions whether India’s largest selling English daily is under pressure to not cover his speech. Is the country’s media under Modi’s grip? Because there clearly cannot be any other reason for the media to not cover the inauguration of a bridge by the Chief Minister of Delhi. How can anyone not think the AAP supremo is as important as he thinks he is? Perhaps people were more interested in knowing excess of force by Delhi Police which arrested a man because his kids burst crackers ? Or how a Kashmiri student who went missing from Sharda University near Delhi had allegedly joined the IS ? Or just the fact that his party and his party supporters including his IT cell head were busy passing off a picture of a bridge in Rotterdam  as the bridge he was supposed to inaugurate that day? Maybe people have just lost interest in reading, hearing what Kejriwal has to say because there is only this much of whininess one could tolerate, especially when they have an option of a clown prince  who is way more entertaining? But then, what Trump does or does not do makes it to news because he heads the world’s most powerful nation. Kejriwal, on the other hand, is a poor man’s Trump, who heads an army of zombies  busy being an annoyance in the lives of voters who elected him. Kejriwal has still a long way to go before he completely Trumpifies. The media has a million flaws. They lie. The misrepresent. They distort. The further an agenda. But not covering a bridge inauguration by the CM of a union territory is not something one can fault them for.

Every word that comes out of his mouth is not of paramount importance to the rest of the world or even, the rest of the country.

This is Hindustan not Pakistan"", said Padmanabha Reddy. To express his love to his father, a Congress Corporator from Bangalore has resorted to a strange decision of renaming roads after his father, who is incidentally still alive. Congress leader Ajmal Baig, a BBMP Corporator from Bapuji Nagar ward( Ward No.134) has decided to rename a stretch from Pipeline Road to Shammanna Garden Underpass as Gafoor Road, after his father Gafoor Baig. According to the reports , the Congress Corporator is also planning to rename other stretches falling in his ward to appease a particular community. The BJP has accused him of misusing public spaces for personal reasons and also, for violating BBMP’s standing order which prohibits naming of roads after people who are still alive. Ajmal Baig is reportedly planning to rename the stretch  from Sunni Chowk to Mysuru Road as Subania Masjid Road. The stretch from Santosh Tent Road to Shobha Tent Road to be named as Jamia Masjid Road. Another road Shamanna Garden 6th cross to Bapuji Nagar 17th cross to be renamed Khadath Masjid Road. Bapuji Nagar 1st main to Bapuji Nagar 17th cross to be known as Heera Masjid Road and 34 Bapuji Nagar ward to be renamed as Fathima Bi Layout and Ameer Kalmi Nagar. The Congress Corporator, however, has justified his decision to rename stretches in his ward by saying that his father was a philanthropist who has spent lakhs of rupees on poor in the Muslim-dominated area. “My father is an important leader in this locality and every year he donates ration to more than 15,000 people during Ramzan”, Ajmal told to the media. He further added that to honour his father’s good work he has renamed the stretch. Ajmal also said he has proposed to change the names of the streets as there is a majority population belonging to the Muslim community. He questioned the people who are criticising his decision by saying that there are more than 50,000 people belonging to the Muslim community. The BJP has slammed the Congress Corporator’s decision of renaming some stretches in the ward to appease minorities. Padmanabha Reddy, the leader of opposition in Municipal Council and BJP member has written to the Mayor on the issue and said that Ajmal Baig has violated the rule no.51 of the KMC Act, which bars changing names of public properties to honour a person who is still alive. “I strongly condemn the proposal to rename layouts mooted by Congress Corporator Ajmal Baig.

222,Murali KV,"While Swami Vivekananda called converts out of Hinduism as “perverts” and Bhimji called them “denationalised”, Rajiv Malhotra did not even repeat any of these. Recently, writer Thayil Jacob Sony George better known as TJS George (TJSG), writing  for the New Indian Express (NIE), equated Rajiv Malhotra to the poison-spewing self-hating sepoy of the West, Christian-convert evangelist Lazarus Mohan . These assertions are not only disingenuous but can be construed as criminally defamatory. While Rajiv Malhotra has proven several times that he can scientifically and logically, in an evidence-based manner, substantiate  his position with data and arguments, the Christian-convert evangelist Lazarus Mohan relies entirely on religious arguments that draw from the bible or illogical superstition that has no basis in science. Thus, from the beginning of the article, it is clear that TJSG is pen-pushing an agenda rather than trying to express an honest opinion or engage in a mutually respectful debate. This author has already explained why Rajiv Malhotra is morally and ethically justifiable with regards to the specific tweet that TJSG is quoting, particularly out-of-context. To support his arguments TJSG quotes phrases from Swami Vivekananda’s speeches and works. For example, he quotes a phrase (not even a whole sentence) from Swami Vivekananda and wrote ‘A saint who said “we accept all religions as true” is being appropriated by a party that suppresses minorities for political gains.’ Swamiji has been most scathing about Abrahamic religions. For example, Swami Vivekananda is recorded to have stated, “When the Mohammedans first came, we are said — I think  The same sentiment is seen in Bharat Ratna Ambedkar’s words a few decades down the lane. He stated during the middle of his life that “Conversion to Islam or Christianity will denationalise the depressed classes,” and reiterated the same opinion  just before dying, “Buddhism is part and parcel of Bhartiya Culture. I have taken care that conversion will not harm the traditions, the culture and history of this land. I confess I have many  While Swami Vivekananda called converts out of Hinduism as “perverts” and Bhimji called them “denationalised”, Rajiv Malhotra did not even repeat any of these. He tweeted that Hindus should donate to Hindu or truly secular charities that will not indulge in proselytisation. Is it not comparably insignificant compared to what Swamiji or Bhimji have said? Will TJS George claim that Swamiji and Bhimji were “peddlers of religious hatred”? Appears so. Now let us see another example of what Swamiji said in Chicago 115-years ago (on the 15th of September 1893) about the narrow-mindedness of the faiths that which TJGS is cunningly defending. Swamiji described  a frog that lived in a well on its own and which had assumed that the well is the whole world. When a sea-living frog got washed away on to the shores and jumped into the well, the well-trapped frog asked where did the sea-living frog come from. When the sea-living frog said it came from the sea, the well-trapped frog asked for the size of the sea in comparison to its tiny well. The sea-living frog laughed and explained the size of the sea was immeasurable, especially when compared to the tiny well. The well-trapped frog got furious with disbelief and unable to bear the truth threw the sea-living frog out of the well. The author need not explain (to the people with conscientious brains) which religions Swamiji must have had in mind, especially given his statements about the “Hindu perverts” to the “denationalising” religions. Regarding cow’s meat, Swami Vivekananda insisted  that not eating beef is the “one point of unity among all Hindus” across the entire subcontinent. Yet TJSG does not refrain from critically abusing the supporters of  Thus, quoting Swami Vivekananda out-of-context and calling the stance taken by the current ruling dispensation as against the visions and words of the Swamiji is a gross misrepresentation and possibly defamatory. TJGS not only misrepresents Swami Vivekananda he goes against the grain and words of Bhimji as well in the process, calling the organisation (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, RSS) praised by Bhimji in 1939 as an exemplar of a caste-free association  as “suppressing minorities” and as one which is calling for a “sectarian war”. TJGS was alluding to RSS without naming it explicitly as again he quoted a phrase, not a whole sentence, from RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s recent speech in the US: ‘But Chicago heard this time a different voice that called for a sectarian war lest “the lone lion is destroyed by wild dogs”.’ Simply atrocious. TJGS is able to do this because he is confident that none will call his bluff. The NIE newspaper publishes it because it sees no liability peddling such vile lies.

226,OpIndia Staff,"The police are considering Reddy's involvement in an ongoing dispute with a rival gang in the village as the reason behind the murder. Nayaran Reddy, a Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader, was allegedly  stoned to death in Telangana’s Vikarabad and his body was discovered on Tuesday, news agency ANI reported. His body was recovered from Sultanpur village of Pargi in Vikarabad. As information of his alleged murder spread, his party supporters attacked  Congress workers, claiming that they were involved in Reddy’s murder. The Congress workers were rushed to a local hospital after the incident. Tension gripped the area following the murder of the local leader and the subsequent clashes between the TRS and Congress supporters. The police have, however, ruled out  the possibility of a political angle to the murder and are considering Reddy’s involvement in an ongoing dispute with a rival gang in the village as the reason behind the murder. Ahead of the assembly elections due next month, several videos have been surfacing,  showing TRS candidates being grilled, shouted at and even being obstructed by voters across the state. A scuffle was reported on Monday, between TRS workers and villagers of Yellandu. As per reports, the clashes took place after the villagers questioned the TRS leader Koram Kanakaiah about the lack of development in the village. In a similar incident  on Sunday, angry TRS workers thrashed locals who were protesting against the TRS candidate in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district. Clashes broke out between villagers and the ruling party cadre when Tungaturthi sitting MLA, Gadhari Kishore went to Anajipuram village.

228,OpIndia Staff,"The state finance officials have clarified that the waivers are only for crop loans and not other loans. While nationalised banks have initiated recovery suits, some private banks have started criminal proceedings against defaulting farmers. As the state government delays the disbursement and execution of farm loan waivers, farmers in several areas of Karnataka have started receiving arrest warrants from the banks. As per reports , several banks are yet to receive the funds and as a result, have started approaching courts and send arrest warrants against defaulting farmers. On Sunday, a major agitation has stirred up in Belgavi district as farmers in many Taluks reportedly received arrest warrants  by a Kolkata magistrate court, for defaulting on their loans taken from Axis bank limited. The court has charged the farmers under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and has reportedly directed the local police to produce them in Kolkata by February 18, 2019. Reports say that while some nationalised banks have filed recovery suits, private banks have gone to the extent of filing criminal cases against the defaulting farmers. In Belgavi alone, approximately 160 farmers have had recovery suits filed against them while 62 have received arrest warrants. As discontent and agitation grows in the state, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene have announced that they will gherao the Vidhana Soudha on November 19. A report in Times of India has stated that the Karnataka Sugarcane growers association is also likely to join the protests. Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy has taken a note and has reportedly stated that the farmers eligible for waivers need not worry. He has also reportedly directed  the deputy commissioners and district police superintendents to be helpful towards farmers. However, the state finance department has warned that only crop loans are eligible for a waiver and not other kinds of loans. The state finance department has further stated that the government is committed to waive off crop loans up to 2 lakhs in scheduled and commercial banks and up to 1 lakh in cooperative banks. Chamasara Patil, the honourary president of the state farmer’s body KRRS, reportedly stated that it is six months since the government announced waivers but it is far from being implemented. He added that in his first meeting with farmers, CM Kumaraswamy had promised that the loans will be waived in 2 phases, first for crop loans and then the other loans. It is notable here that after the dramatic political events in May, when Kumaraswamy came to power after a post-poll alliance between Congress and JDS, their demand for farm loan waivers had intensified since all leading parties had sought votes over the promise. Kumaraswamy had announced that he cannot declare a waiver without the express support of Congress  as Congress held more seats. Interestingly, Rahul Gandhi just a few days ago on 15th October had asserted that they had delivered on their promise of waivering farmer loans in Karnataka within 10 days of coming to power and they would do the same in Madhya Pradesh. The failure of the government in the speedy implementation of the process was also reported in July. Weeks after the announcement of the waivers, the state government had not yet begun disbursements to banks and it was predicted that it might cause trouble for the farmers.

Hiphei, one of the senior most Congress leader in the Northeast, was elected to the Assembly from the Palak constituency. He was elected to Rajya Sabha Member two times from 1990 to 2002.

230,OpIndia Staff,"It is ironical that someone from Congress would accuse others of 'destroying the Constitution' when it was former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who had brought about the Emergency on 25th June 1975. Days after Congress leader Shashi Tharoor made a controversial statement on PM Modi comparing him to a scorpion on a Shivlinga  and attributing it to anonymous people, another senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, who had warned of bloodshed if Constitution is changed, compared  PM Modi to Hitler for ‘killing the Constitution’. Kharge was speaking at the ‘Samvidhan Bachao Sammelan’ in Mumbai where he said that efforts are being made to bring in a dictatorship in India, the way Hitler did in Germany. Accusing  the BJP and the RSS of destroying the Constitution, Kharge said Constitution does not belong to the people of a particular caste, religion or community, but it belongs to the whole of India. “Ever since BJP has come to power, it has destroyed freedom of expression and is continuously imposing censors on the press,” Kharge said. It is ironical that someone from Congress would accuse others of ‘destroying the Constitution’ when it was former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who had brought about the Emergency on 25th June 1975. In a Facebook post earlier this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had drawn  a parallel between Indira Gandhi and Hitler and said that they both had turned democracy into a dictatorship. In fact, Jaitley had written that unlike Hitler, Indira Gandhi had endeavoured to transform India into a “dynastic democracy”. This is not the first time Congress leaders have indulged in name-calling. The opposition leaders such as Mani Shankar Aiyar have frequently abused  Prime Minister Narendra Modi by referring to him ‘Chaiwala’ and ‘Neech Insan’ as an attempt to lower the dignity of Narendra Modi. Congress leaders like Manish Tiwari and Digvijaya Singh have often resorted to using derogatory words  against the Prime Minister.

231,OpIndia Staff,"Shashi Tharoor avoided answering a direct question about whether he would want a Ram Temple built at Ram Janmabhoomi by saying he had already 'said what he had to' After insulting the Hindu Community by his ‘Good Hindu-Bad Hindu ‘ tirade, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has now insinuated Hindus by saying that they should follow their own scriptures and stop violence to get their way to build Ram Mandir. Shashi Tharoor went on to say that Hindus should rather build Ram in their hearts. , The Congress MP was responding to his recent controversy, where he had said that no good Hindu would want a temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site.Reportedly “In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart. And if Ram is built in our heart it should little matter where else he is or he is not, because he is everywhere,” Tharoor said in an exclusive interview to PTI. Tharoor went on to contend  that while a good Hindu is somebody who believes his worship but Hindu scriptures do not allow the use of violence to have one’s way. He further said that the Hindus in the country are seeking to build a Ram temple by resorting to violence. “My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has ‘insaaniyat’,” the Congress leader asked. Following Shashi Tharoor’s statements, social media users reacted and highlighted Tharoor’s hypocrisy and his Christian appeasement politics. Some Social media users suggested Tharoor of making Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister in his hearts. It would seem like Shashi Tharoor’s only aim is to continually assert that a Ram Mandir should not be built on Ram Janmabhoomi in order to appease Congress’ votebank. He said: “Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?” He went on to call the fact that there was a temple which was desecrated to build the Babri Masjid merely an “academic debate”. Shashi Tharoor avoided answering a direct question about whether he would want a Ram Temple built at Ram Janmabhoomi by saying he had already ‘said what he had to’ The Congress leader with these polarising statements seems to be hinting at the Congress party’s position regarding the Ram Mandir Issue.

232,OpIndia Staff,"The level of hypocrisy in Rahul Gandhi's statement is higher than that of current pollution levels in Delhi The Indian version of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Congress President Rahul Gandhi has a soft corner for animals is a known fact. After all, he chose to feed his pet dog Pidi  when former Assam Congress leader Himanta Biswa Sarma and other leaders wanted to discuss Assam issues during the Assam assembly elections. Today, expressing sadness over the killing of Avni, the tigress by Shafat Ali Khan and his son Asghar in Maharashtra, Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to cite a quote by Mahatma Gandhi. The man-eating tigress Avni who is believed to be responsible for the death of 13 people in past two years, had Supreme Court directive  to tranquilise and trap her. The forest department had also issued a shoot-to-kill order for Avni, which was to be used as a last resort. Avni, however, was killed when she reportedly tried to attack the stalking team which shot her.

233,OpIndia Staff,"Several Congress leaders are unhappy with Congress - TDP alliance in Telangana, as they feel it may be repeated in Andhra Pradesh also. Two former ministers in Andhra Pradesh—Vatti Vasanta Kumar and C. Ramachandraiah have resigned  from the Congress on Saturday, protesting against the party aligning with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). As per reports , this decision made by the former ministers is the consequence of Congress president Rahul Gandhi joining hands with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu “on the pretext of dethroning the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of Narendra Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll”. On Saturday (November 3), Ramachandraiah said, “Naidu has abused the Congress party in the strongest term in the past, he rebuked Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and even engineered protests in Guntur when he came there. How can Rahul then ignore Naidu’s dirty politics and shake hands with him?” He further criticised Rahul for admitting former chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy back in the Congress fold, even though Reddy had openly defied the Congress leadership and vilified it from public platforms. “The Congress has neither ideological strength nor a future at least in Andhra Pradesh,” added Ramachandraiah. While the TDP and Congress have joined hands to fight the assembly election in Telangana jointly against the ruling TRS (Telangana Rastra Samithi), some Congress leaders are worried  that the same may happen in Andhra Pradesh. According to Vasanta Kumar, the prospects of Congress have improved in Andhra Pradesh but the latest developments were “suicidal”. However, other senior leaders in the Congress are in full support of their President, stating that the alliance will not have any adverse impact on the party and instead, it would intensify the presence  of the party in the State, which has lost most of its rank and file after the State bifurcation. Although Ramachandraiah claims  that it was his individual decision to quit the party and was unaware that others would follow suit, those in the know of things with the Congress predict that many more leaders might egress from the grand old party in the State. The former Leader of Opposition in the State Legislative Council expressed, “Many senior Congress leaders in AP, including APCC president N Raghuveera Reddy, are not happy in the Congress’ unilateral decision to join hands with the TDP in Telangana. We have joined hands with those who weakened the party in the State.” The Congress has remained dejected in the state since the 2014 elections. Several party members had migrated to other parties, notably the TDP and the Yvajana Sramika Rythu (YSR) Congress, with a few to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as others stayed on in the hope that the Congress will be born again as a party based on its ideological strengths. Now, despondent and despaired with the latest developments, some have set their sights on the Jana Sena. Another ex-minister S Sailajanath, who is also bracing to resign from the party, is poised to join the Jana Sena of actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan. Chandrababu Naidu at a teleconference on Friday attempted  to console and convince the sections in TDP opposing the understanding with the Congress, describing it as a “democratic compulsion” in order to protect the party and safeguard the interests of the state from the Modi regime.",2018-11-05,"2018 Assembly Elections,andhra pradesh,Chandrababu Naidu,Congress,rahul gandhi,TDP,telangana,telangana assembly elections,TRS","Congress leaders quit party in Andhra, oppose Congress-TDP alliance in Telangana",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/congress-leaders-quit-party-in-andhra-oppose-congress-tdp-alliance-in-telangana/
234,Dhaval Patel,"The title itself is not only misleading but is seen as an attempt to downplay the achievement of India, once Britain's colony which it lived off, so pompously for over 200 years when it suited their moral conscience. #StatueOfUnity prevailed all over the news headlines for the last three days for reasons well known. Widely held to be PM Modi’s personal brainchild and pet project, the foundation for the project was laid down in 2013, its construction was formally completed in mid-October 2018 in a record time span of 33 months. The inaugural ceremony was held on 31st October 2018, as the statue was opened to the world, presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself. In engineering circles around the globe, the gargantuan statue is being described and credited as a tribute to the under-rated Indian engineering skills. The world is facing a paradoxical situation, being aroused and intrigued by the particular marvellous feat and at the same time is left feeling bothered about the #StatueOfUnity. After all, it’s the world’s tallest statue built by a third world country which is making strides in every field larger than what their petty minds can fathom. With a height of 182 metres (597 ft) or about two times as tall as the Statue of Liberty. The international media has been ever since trying to downplay the feat achieved by India using entirely local Indi-generous technology and manpower. Daily Mail UK came out with a distinctly offensive article titled  “That’s rich! We gave £1 billion aid to India as they built £330million statue”. The title itself is not only misleading but is seen as an attempt to downplay the achievement of India, once Britain’s colony which it lived off, so pompously for over 200 years when it suited their moral conscience. The parasite, now a full-bloodied creature, cannot possibly come to terms with India’s rise, a country it left in shambles, built back so painstakingly by the Iron Man himself. The article quotes Britain MP Peter Bone who has opined “To take £1.1billion in aid from us and then at the same time spend £330million on a statue is a total nonsense and it is the sort of thing that drives people mad. What it proves is that we should not be giving money to India. It is up to them how they spend their money but if they can afford this statue, then it is clearly a country we should not need to be giving aid to.” Hours after the article was published Twitter users started to call out the hypocrisy of Britain MP Peter Bone. BJP Youth Wing leader SG Suryah from Tamil Nadu tweeted out saying “British who once ruled us are reduced to nothing while India is a Global Power. Obviously they can’t tolerate India scaling heights. He added that not a single pount from the British aid went in the making of the statue. In the series of tweets, Suryah called out the lies and deplorable distortions of truths, made by the Britain MP Peter Bone and gave him facts & figures that could go out and embarrass the UK. He first spelt out the figures on Indian money being pumped into the UK in terms of higher education contributing enormously to their growth story. Then he went on to quote about the wealth plundered by the British Empire in India while it occupied it for over two centuries. Thereafter he referred to the events that transpired in 2012 when India rejected the funds while Britain kept on insisting to receive the funds to save their(Britain Govt.) face locally. The fact is that not one pound from the British Aid that was given to India, went to the construction of this grand statue, the very headline of Daily Mail UK is misleading, notorious and banks fallacious comparisons, done with the sole intent of downplaying this monumental feat India has achieved a couple of days back. And it is most certainly not the job of the likes a British MP “Peter Bone” to decide what is nonsense and what makes people mad, it’s time to call out this MP and leave him a memo about the immutable foreseeable change that India is going to bring to the World Order. It is natural to be envious of the people who were once mere servants under your regime, but are now reclaiming their glory in spite of what you did to them but dear Mr Bone, why don’t you mind your own business and perhaps try to save your own economy?",2018-11-04,"Aid,british,British empire,British rule,Media,media bias,misleading,sardar patel,statue of unity,UK",Bitter baby empire: It’s time the UK minds its own business,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/uk-daily-mail-statue-of-unity-mind-own-business-narendra-modi/

Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Chief and Rajya Sabha member Raj Babbar, while commenting on the Naxal activity in poll-bound Chhattisgarh compared  Naxals with revolutionaries saying that “revolution” undertaken by them should be resolved through conversation. “I only want to say that the people whose rights have been taken away, who are in misery, who are not being given their right worth, are laying their lives to get back their rights. However, usage of guns by either of the parties will not lead to any solution. A solution will only come out by addressing their problems and having a conversation with them,” said  Babbar sympathising with Naxals. Babbar’s statement comes days after two security personnel and a Doordarshan cameraman were killed  in a brutal Naxal attack in Dantewada. The actor-turned-politician said that the government should address their questions as they are fighting for their rights. “Naxal movement was started for the rights. For these rights, we need to sit with people. Some people have lost their way and we need to bring them back on the right path,” Babbar said. “Decisions are not made with guns. We need to address their questions. With fear, sycophancy, greed, the people of a revolution cannot be stopped. This is my view and I have also shared it with my party,” he added. Maoist violence has claimed  as many as 12,000 lives over the last two decades. The data analysis  by South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP)  indicates that more than 1900 (pecisely 1984) security forces – including CRPF security personnel – died in the country due to Left-wing extremism since 2005, out of which most of fatalities have been recorded from in Bastar, Bijapur, Sukma and Dantewada districts. Babbar refuted  BJP’s allegation that Congress backs Naxals saying, “The Congress party had lost its state leadership (in a Naxal attack in May 2013).

Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti (ABSS), an umbrella organisation of over 3000 Hindu saints from 127 sects on Sunday appealed their followers and other Hindus  to ensure that the Narendra Modi government returns to power in 2019. The sadhus after rigorous deliberations also passed a resolution demanding the Union government to bring an ordinance or a law to build the Ram Mandir. The Sadhus from across the country had come together at the Delhi’s Talkatora stadium to discuss the future course  of action to be pursued following the Supreme Court’s decision to postpone the hearing of the Ram Mandir case. The Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti on Sunday asked the people to bring back Narendra Modi government in the upcoming 2019 elections. People should vote for those who have faith in “Gau, Ganga, Geeta, Gayatri and Govind”, they said. The Delhi conclave deliberated on a number of issues, including construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, a parliamentary legislation for cow protection, cleaning of the Ganga river. “We direct the government to either bring in a law or an ordinance (for the construction of the Ram temple). There will be no compromise on this,” Ramanandacharya Hansdevacharya, the patron of the organisation, said in his concluding remarks at the conclave. The Sants expressed their confidence  in the Narendra Modi government. Ramanandacharya Hansdevacharya said that only BJP government can meet our expectations. “Apna desh bhi bachao, apni sanskriti bhi bachao, aur phir se iss Bharat ke andar yahi sarkar ko 2019 me wapas lao (Save the country and its culture, bring back this government in 2019)”, he said. He further said that if Hindus want to protect their lives, temples and mutts, daughters and sisters, culture and tradition, then Narendra Modi government must be brought back. Hansdevacharya spoke about how sants were hurt with the deliberate obstruction caused against the building of the Ram temple at Ayodhya but also expressed satisfaction with the central government’s work related to the nation, religion, culture, national security, and national pride. The ABSS statement also said that NOTA is an insult to democracy, and urged everyone to positively vote for the leader of their choice. Sant Govindeo Giri of Pune said that  “certain forces” were trying to destabilise the Modi government, and that a “conspiracy” against the government was being done in Madhya Pradesh. The gathering called for the creation of a new “Teerthan Ministry” to promote pilgrimages, and requested the government not turn these pilgrimage centres into tourism destinations. The ‘Dharmadesh’ conclave also discussed issues like illegal immigration of the Rohingya Muslims and asked the government to deport them. The issues like the Uniform Civil Code and National Population Policy to control the “imbalance” were also discussed. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living spoke about three possible ways forward on the issue of the Ram temple. He said that it can be solved through dialogue or by an appeal to the Supreme Court seeking an early verdict, and a third option by making a request to the central government. The Sant Samiti has also announced three more “dharma sabhas” to be held in Ayodhya, Nagpur, and Bengaluru on November 25. The Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti is planning to hold a large congregation of sadhus in Delhi on December 9. It is planning to organise 500 more such meetings from December 18  across the country. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is also pushing for early construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Recently, RSS said that it will take up  another agitation similar to the one in 1992 “if needed” in order to ensure the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat at his annual Vijayadashami celebration speech had urged  the Narendra Modi-led BJP government of bringing in a law to build a Ram Mandir at the disputed land in Ayodhya. The Supreme Court on October 29th adjourned  hearings in the Ayodhya dispute until January next year. The Supreme Court has also said that it will decide in January whether the case should be heard in February, March, April or after that.",2018-11-05,"2019 lok sabha elections,Ayodhya,BJP,gods,hindu,Hindu Rights,Hindu Temples,Ordinance,PM Narendra Modi,Ram Mandir,Ram mandir-Babri masjid dispute,RSS",Hindu Saints appeal voters to bring back Narendra Modi government to save the nation and its culture,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/hindu-saints-appeal-voters-to-bring-back-narendra-modi-government-to-save-the-nation-and-its-culture/
237,Jhankar Mohta,"The shallow display of loftiness seems to have become a habitude with the Congress-JD(s) members The Congress party has long spoken about democracy and painted itself as the upholders of democracy. However, in Karnataka, the Congress-JDS government has proven time and again that democracy is a tool by which they can usurp power and that, respect for the electorate and the people of Karnataka is sorely missing in their politicians. The Karnataka legislative assembly elections which were held in May 2018, had seen BJP emerging as the single largest party securing 104 seats. Congress in its desperation to retain power had then gone into an ‘opportunistic alliance’  with the JD(s) and artfully offered the Chief Minister post to the JD(s) which was incontrovertibly an insult to the Karnataka’s people’s mandate who had clearly not wished to see a JD(s) candidate as their CM, considering the party had managed to secure an insignificant 37 seats out of the total of 224 seats. The BJP chief ministerial candidate B.S. Yeddyurappa had also accused  the Congress of trying to subvert the popular mandate and come back to power through the back door by offering support to JDS to form the government. Congress in its craving to form the government in Karnataka had further committed  a grave mistake by playing the Veerashaiva-Lingayat card, trying to divide people on the basis of religion, to garner votes in the elections. Essentially, Congress, which prides itself on being a “secular” party has never respected Hindus or even its electorate in general. In Karnataka, they not only divided Hindus but also joined hands with PFI, a radical Islamist outfit just to sit on the seat of power. Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, the Chief Minister, who was actually forced, by the Congress, on the people of Karnataka, had also left no stone unturned  to outrage the public  of Karnataka since he and his party did not get an absolute majority, which meant that he and his party were rejected by the electorate. “Mine is not an independent government. I had requested the people to give me a mandate that prevents me from succumbing to any pressure other than you. But today I am at the mercy of the Congress. I am not under the pressure of the 6.5 crore people of the state,” Kumaraswamy said. Upholding the Congress culture, the Congress Neta’s too, have been often seen displaying their insensitivity towards commoners. Recently a video surfaced  where Congress senior leader and Karnataka Revenue Minister, RV Deshpande was caught on camera after he was filmed throwing sports kits from a stage at national, state and district level athletes at a function where they were supposed to be felicitated. The video showing the apparent high-handedness of the minister has gone viral on social media, with several netizens criticising the minister for his attitude. This shallow display of loftiness seems to have become a habitude with the Congress-JD(s) members after parties have come together in its desperation to form the government in Karnataka. Earlier too, in a blatant show of insensitivity , Karnataka CM’s brother was caught on camera ‘throwing’ relief packages to flood victims. It was reported  that some of the people declined to eat the biscuits which were thrown at them, while some others ate the biscuit packets as they were hungry and desperate. The victims who have lost their houses and belongings were expecting massive help from the state machinery and the elected representatives. This arrogant behaviour from the Minister has disappointed the flood victims. The JDS-Congress government in Karnataka has repeatedly insulted its own electorate and the citizens of Karnataka. Only time will tell how the citizens respond to a government that seems to respect its people too much.",2018-11-03,"Congress,congress-JD(S) alliance,Congress-JDS,hd kumaraswamy,karnataka,Lingayat",The Congress-JDS govt in Karnataka has proved time and again that they have no respect for the people,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/the-congress-jds-govt-in-karnataka-has-proved-time-and-again-that-they-have-no-respect-for-the-people/

This confirmation has finally put an end to all the speculation and controversy which had emerged  almost immediately after Moon Jae-in took to Twitter to thank Modi for the affability extended towards him. During his official visit to India, President Moon Jae-in was particularly impressed by the vests worn by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and had complimented PM Modi for the same. As a goodwill gesture, Modi had gifted  the President of the Republic of Korea customised ‘Modi Vests’, meticulously tailored to fit him. On October 31, Moon Jae-in tweeted  pictures of the sleeveless jackets, to be worn on a kurta, thanking him for his warm-hearted gesture. Modi’s this exercise, as expected, did not go down well with a few known Modi critics. A controversy broke out on Twitter on how the jackets should be described. The tweets sparked a debate, as some claimed  that these were actually Nehru Jackets, popularised by the country’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah was one of the few who took to Twitter twisting this laudable gesture attempting to devalue the entire episode. However, Bipin Chauhan, the managing director of JadeBlue lifestyle India, which sent the vests to the South Korean president, has now confirmed  that these were actually ‘Modi Jackets’. Chauhan said he has been designing and making Modi’s clothes since 1989. Putting an end to all the hypothesis and nit-picking Chauhan said, “Originally, these were ‘bandhgala’ (closed neck) jackets. They were worn by Nehru and even Sardar Patel. But the ones we sell are Modi Jackets. It is a bit longer and more comfortable in fit than Nehru Jackets.” The older versions were sold off in white and black shades, but Modi prefers a wider colour palette, he said. Chauhan furthered that Modi had created a brand which has become popular since 2014. “In the past, these jackets, worn by Nehru and Sardar, were considered premium apparel for the elite. Now Modi-Ji has popularised them among the masses,” he added.",2018-11-03,"India-korea,Left Liberal,leftist propaganda,make in india,modi clothes,modi government,Modi Vests,Moon Jae-in,PM Narendra Modi,president,South Korea",Makers confirm that vests gifted by PM Modi to South Korean President were ‘Modi jackets’ and not ‘Nehru jackets’,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/makers-confirm-that-vests-gifted-by-pm-modi-to-south-korean-president-were-modi-vests-and-not-nehru-jacket/
239,Sanghamitra,"Carrying forward the legacy of 'press freedom' and glorifying dissent in a democracy like Indira Gandhi did in her days, Jha has indeed spoken like a true Congressi. Arnab Goswami has been a constant thorn for many a secular, liberal, dynasty admirers. For years, he has been screaming his way into their comfort zones of blissful sanctimony. As if the humiliating interview of Rahul Gandhi back in 2014 was not enough, the man has been rather hell-bent on dragging skeletons out of the Congress closets and has been questioning their eminent eliteness every evening with his insufferable ‘The nation wants to know’. Now, like salt rubbing on their already painful wounds, the central government has appointed  Goswami as a member of the coveted Nehru Memorial Museum and Library society, the powerful body which controls the Teen Murti Estate. JMML is now tasked with making a memorial for all the prime ministers of India, not just Nehru. Goswami is to replace Pratap Bhanu Mehta. The outrage was bound to come. An interesting thing about the outrages was how brazenly can the critics of Arnab hail his appointment as a reward for his alleged ‘RSS sponsorship’ without admitting willfully that the people who were replaced were there because of a certain political favouritism. Well it seems, the cabal has the impunity to do it and defend it too. Because in the ‘idea of India’, some appointments are secular while some are communal. The most remarkable outrage has come from Congress spokesperson  Sanjay Jha, who has seemingly dismissed all subtlety and has shared a statement that is basically the Twitter way of saying ‘ Arnab Goswami should be proud. He has just been added to the distinguished list of goals that Congress wants to accomplish if they come to power in 2019. Judging by the seriousness of Jha’s words, sacking Arnab should feature right on the top of the list, amongst establishing mobile factories in Bhopal/Chitrakoot/Jhunjhunu. Carrying forward the legacy of ‘press freedom’  and glorifying ‘dissent in a democracy’ like Indira Gandhi did in her days, Jha has indeed spoken like a true Congressi. There were others who criticised Arnab’s appointment, though none of them matched Sanjay Jha  in terms of viciousness. Arnab Goswami should be worried. With the kind of confidence Jha has about come back to power in 2019, he might as well be sacked from the channel he owns and he most certainly, will be sacked from his appointment to the Nehru Museum. One wonders if this outrage is about Arnab Goswami, the fact that Goswami refuses to toe the Congress line or that they believe Goswami would support turning the Nehru Museum into a place that showcases all past Prime Ministers of the Country and not just the liberal favourite Nehru.",2018-11-03,"Appointment,Arnab Goswami,Congress,Emergency,freedom of press,Indira Gandhi,Republic TV,sanjay jha,Teen Murti Bhavan",Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha threatens Arnab Goswami after his appointment to Nehru Museum,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/liberals-have-meltdown-and-congress-spokesperson-threatens-arnab-goswami-after-his-appointment-nehru-museum/
240,OpIndia Staff,"Justice Chelameswar was speaking at an event organised by Congress' AIPC. Justice Chelameswar, former Supreme Court judge, speaking at an interactive session hosted by the All India Professionals Congress, an organisation affiliated to the Congress party, reportedly said  that it is possible for the government to bring a law to construct the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, even when the dispute is before the Supreme Court. Justice Chelameswar was among the four senior judges of Supreme Court who held  the unprecedented press conference to question the style of functioning of the former CJI Deepak Mishra. CPI MP D Raja’s conspicuous visit  at Justice Chelmeswar’s house had further triggered a political storm. Responding to a question during the interactive session,  Justice (Retired) Chelameswar said it could happen . “Legally if it can happen (or not) is one aspect. Whether it will happen (or not) is another. I’m aware of instances that happened in the past where decisions of the Supreme Court were scuttled by the legislative process,” he said. He cited the example of the Karnataka Vidhan Sabha which passed  a law to overturn the SC order on the Cauvery water dispute and another instance of an inter-state water dispute between Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. “The nation should have opened up to these things much earlier. This (a law on Ram temple) is possible as we did not stop it then,” he added. His comments came at a time when the clamour for Ram Mandir is rising  day by day. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had earlier on Friday said that Hindus were feeling “insulted” by the Supreme Court’s declaration that the Ayodhya issue is not a priority and insisted that an ordinance would be needed if all options run out.

The Centre is inching towards setting up a museum for all the Prime Ministers of the country at Teen Murthi Estate as it has now removed three members of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) society who had opposed the idea of honouring other Prime Ministers at Teen Murthi Estate. The decision to remove three members, economist Nitin Desai, professor Udayan Mishra and former bureaucrat BP Singh from the NMML has been taken as the Centre wants to set up “museum for all prime ministers” for which it had also laid the foundation a few days back. Few members of the Nehru memorial society were unhappy about the Narendra Modi government’s decision. Reportedly, The government has brought in new members to replace the sacked members and has appointed former Foreign Secretary S Jaishanker (replacing Dr B P Singh), eminent Journalist Arnab Goswami (replacing Bhanu Pratap Mehta), BJP MP and President of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations Vinay Sahasrabuddhe (replacing Prof. Udayon Misra) and Chairman of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts Ram Bahadur Rai (replacing Nitin Desai) to the NMML society. The new members will hold the responsibilities from October 29, 2018, to April 26, 2020, said a notification issued by the Ministry of Culture. The sacked three members are known to be Nehru loyalists and had been critical of the government’s decision to build any memorial to other Prime Minister at Teen Murthi Estate. Nitin Desai and BP Singh had openly stated their displeasure with the museum for all PMs taking shape in NMML. In September, the Sonia Gandhi led Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund was asked to vacate  the Teen Murti Complex. The ministry of housing and urban affairs had stated in its letter that the JNMF is occupying the premises without any authority of law and the NMML needs the space. BP Singh in the last annual general meeting had expressed his unhappiness over setting up a new museum and said that he had basic problems with the title and the concept of the proposed museum for all Prime Ministers. As per a report  in the Economic Times, he had further questioned the intent by saying that there will be a demand in every state to have a Chief Minister’s museum if the Centre builds a museum to honour the Prime Ministers. Nitin Desai did not agree with the proposed amendments to set up a museum inside the Teen Murti Estate. He also questioned the necessity of such a museum in the campus of the NMML. He said that by bringing in all PMs inside NMML, the memorial was opening itself to unwanted controversies. The Ministry of Culture notification also says the government has accepted the resignation of one of the former members of the society Pratap Bhanu Mehta who had quit, citing “political pressure”. Arnab Goswami, who replaces him has a Bachelor’s (Hons.) in Sociology from the Hindu College in Delhi University. However, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, a member of the NMML society reacted to the Centre’s reforms to the NMML, claimed that the members who have been removed were people with integrity and scholarship.

The march led by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal started from Gurudwara Patparganj and ended outside Parliament Street police station. Protestors demanding  justice for the victims raised slogans against the Congress party and its leaders. They also burnt effigies during their protest in Delhi. The protestors surrounded  former Congress President, Sonia Gandhi’s house seeking justice for thousands of innocent Sikhs who were mercilessly massacred and for innumerable women who were brutally raped during the riots. Protestors claimed that Congress has denied their community any form of justice and have always shielded their own leaders, namely Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler who were allegedly involved  in the 1984 anti-Sikh-riots. MLA Sirsa alleged  that though Rahul Gandhi for all these years has been defending  his party, his party leaders are the ones who had masterminded  the genocide. The 1984 anti-Sikh-riots, also known as the 1984 Sikh Massacre, was a series of organised pogroms  against Sikhs in India by anti-Sikh mobs in the aftermath of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination by her Sikh bodyguards. Official Indian government reports numbered about 2,800 killed across India, including 2,100 in Delhi alone. Expressing her agony over the injustice, Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal called the 1984 riots a blot on India. “Our community has been seeking justice for 34 years now. Thousands of Sikhs were massacred, several women were raped and several people lost their homes. Such atrocity is a blot in the history of India. No one received justice.

According to reports , the Election Commission on Friday directed the Mizoram government to remove a principal secretary-level officer, Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, on the charges of meddling with the election process. Chuaungo, a 1987-batch Gujarat-cadre IAS officer, has been serving in Mizoram on an inter-cadre deputation from Gujarat, approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The order came after reports appeared  in a section of the media that state Chief Electoral Officer SB Shashank had complained to the EC that Chuaungo was interfering with the election process. The EC also directed that he should be relieved of his current responsibilities with immediate effect and not be assigned any work related to the state until the elections are over. “The Election Commission is satisfied that the continuance of Mr Lalnunmawia Chuaungo as Principal Secretary (Home), in State Government of Mizoram will have the adverse impact on the conduct of smooth, free and fair election process in Mizoram,” the EC order said . CEO Shashank had highlighted  the “active role” played by Chuaungo, heading the Home and Finance departments, in abetting the government’s intrusion in electoral roll revision and deployment of central armed police forces. He had warned that Chuaungo’s direct or indirect interference is likely to increase as elections reach closer. Shashank had alleged insensitivity on part of the state government regarding voting rights of Bru refugees living in Tripura. He cited interference of the Department of Home Affairs in the electoral revision process by asking the District Election Officers not to consider the identification slips for any purpose other than repatriation of refugees. According to him, the Mizoram government did not seem keen to have any new Bru voters enrolled. Shortly after the removal of Chuaungo, an umbrella organisation of major civil societies and student bodies of the state demanded  the removal of Mizoram Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) S B Shashank, claiming that he has lost the trust of the people. The NGO Coordination Committee asked S B Shashank to leave the state by Monday evening.

This time too, the state Congress government has stated that they will not allow the Bru to vote.

Kapil Mishra, in his tweet, claimed that he was informed by an official, who has been overviewing the construction of the bridge, that neither the construction of the bridge has been completed nor the trial.

However, Congress has promised  rehabilitation centres for addicts at different places along with counselling centres to supplement and support the efforts of NGOs and church. “We will take strict measures to control the sale of liquor in the state so that provisions of the Mizoram Liquor (Prohibition and Control) Act, 2014, are not violated,” assured the CM. Taking a jibe at Congress, Mizo National Front president Zoramthanga said, “Congress is playing cheap politics. They will promise the moon and stars in their manifesto. They know they will not return to power and can hence promise a car to each family in the state”. The Congress manifesto also promised housing for the poor in rural areas and residential quarters for employees of police and education departments.

Protests erupted at the Chhattisgarh Congress office yesterday after the party released the last list of candidates for the upcoming legislative assembly elections. The announcement of candidates has upset many within the party which has led to tension in the office. As per sources, angry supporters of Ejaz Dhabar, who has been denied a ticket from Raipur South constituency, started creating a ruckus and vandalised Congress office. Dhabar was considered a strong candidate, but the ticket was given to Kanhaiya Agarwal, which angered his supporters. Few days back, a video  had gone viral in which Dhabar was reportedly seen threatening Chhattisgarh Congress in-charge P L Punia that if he is denied a ticket, he will create a disturbance. As per reports , party workers also created a ruckus in Bilaspur office over ticket distribution. Among those who are denied tickets is Dr Renu Jogi, wife of former chief minister Ajit Jogi, following which she has joined her husband’s Janata Congress Chhattisgarh. With elections around the corner, the infighting within Congress has peaked.

249,Vijaya Dar,"The Congress knows that if it has to regain power it has to somehow destroy Modi. The constant personal abuse directed at him is symptomatic of the deep frustration with his style of open and transparent governance as against the opacity of his opponents.  It was Dr Martin Luther King who said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice”. But, the curve of the arc is so imperceptible that most people just do not see it. Rebecca Solnit writes in her article, The Arc of Justice and the Long Run: “I don’t know what’s coming. I do know that, whatever it is, some of it will be terrible, but some of it will be miraculous, that term we reserve for the utterly unanticipated, the seeds we didn’t know the soil held. And I know that we don’t know what we do does. As Shane Bauer points out, the doing is the crucial thing.” The largest mountain and the largest volcano in the solar system, both are the same – Olympus Mons on the planet Mars. The mountain rises up to a height of a staggering 26 kilometres that makes it three times the height of Mount Everest. But if one were to attempt climbing it one would hardly get the feeling that one was on a mountain. Its slope is so gentle that it almost looks flat. The popular perception of volcanoes is that of a steep mountain hiding within its bosom vast amounts of destructive energy that, once unleashed, can devour whole cities. The absence of tectonic plate movement on Mars allows the Martian crust to remain fixed in place over a magma hotspot, allowing repeated, large, lava flows. At its base, Olympus Mons is 550 Kms. The curvature of this volcano is just as imperceptible as the moral arc of Dr King. The energy contained within Dr King’s moral universe can also be infinite, but as Ms Solnit writes, “sometimes hope lies in not looking forward but backwards to study the line of that arc”. The UPA’s own Olympus Mons erupted with repeated magma flows in the shape of Adarsh, 2G, CWG, Antrix-Devas, Tatra Trucks, Coalgate, and a number of other explosions, and in the absence of any tectonic plate movement within the Congress party, the crust at the top just became thicker and thicker. However, it also became possible for people to see the curvature of the arc of moral injustice, and when Anna Hazare decided to sit on a fast demanding the institution of a Jan Lokpal; he touched a raw nerve in almost every ordinary citizen of the land. The overwhelming response from the people was quite infectious and the contours of a moral revolution were just getting outlined. The movement that began on 5th April 2011 at Jantar Mantar soon grew into a mass civic protest across urban India. By keeping politicians of all hues at bay, it derived a moral legitimacy that similar protest movements had failed to garner in the past. It would have been obvious to even a child that a government, neck-deep in corruption, would never agree to the proposals put forward by civil society; that it would resort to deception, lies, subterfuge, disinformation, and physical coercion to crush the movement; exactly how the Manmohan Singh government responded to Anna Hazare’s challenge. It had no compunction in orchestrating a debate in the Lok Sabha and then adopting, what was euphemistically called a “sense of the house” resolution on three key issues raised by Anna Hazare. The “sense of the house” resolution moved by Mr. Pranab Mukherjee on 27th August 2011, read: “This House agrees ‘in principle’ on following issues — (i) Citizen’s Charter, (ii) lower bureaucracy under Lokpal through an appropriate mechanism, and (iii) establishment of Lokayukta in the States; And further resolves to forward the proceedings of the House to the Standing Committee on Law and Justice while finalizing its report.” A Standing Committee, we know, is where all inconvenient demands are sent for ceremonial burial. Anna Hazare broke his fast the next day, and from then began his journey into obscurity and irrelevance. Political battles cannot be fought non-politically. Whoever advised Anna against converting the protest movement into a new political association had obviously never been a student of history. By dissociating his movement from Arvind Kejriwal and denouncing the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party, Anna Hazare failed to see the truth behind his moral pretensions. Political realism, as defined by Robert Musil, the Austrian writer, in his novel, “The Man Without Qualities” is a “sensibility driven by needs rather than by ideas.” Robert D. Kaplan, in his essay “Kissinger, Metternich, and Realism” writes: “Realism is thus about deftly playing the hand that has been dealt you. It is not exciting or inspiring.” Looking back, can we say that Anna Hazare knew Arvind Kejriwal and his associates better? The precipitous descent of the Aam Aadmi Party into a bottomless pit of moral turpitude has made it indistinguishable from the Congress, and today stands completely exposed as nothing but the B-team of Sonia Gandhi’s outfit. Drunk with power, Arvind Kejriwal has destroyed the magical dream that the Anna Hazare movement had evoked. Kejriwal’s moral arc flattened even before it had begun to emerge. As Dr King said: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy.” Both Kejriwal and Anna Hazare failed abysmally on this measuring scale. The curve of the moral arc that began to become perceptible from April 2011 actually started to point towards justice only from that day on 20th May 2014 when Narendra Modi first entered the Parliament. This is how The Indian Express reported it: “As he stepped into Parliament for the first time, Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi on Tuesday bowed, with his forehead touching the stairs, to register his high respect for the “temple of democracy”. “Soon after arriving at the main gate of the Parliament building, Modi was greeted with bouquets by BJP leaders. After accepting their greetings, Modi touched the ground of the entrance with folded hands. “I visited the Gujarat Chief Minister’s chamber for the first time when I became the Chief Minister. I entered the Gujarat Assembly for the first time after I became the Chief Minister. I have come here also for the first time,” the 63-year-old said later in the historic Central Hall of Parliament.” Never before had any Prime Minister shown such deep reverence for an institution and touched the entrance steps with his forehead. The arrogance of the office had precluded any such behaviour from the days of Nehru and his descendants. Even the normally servile and naturally bent Manmohan Singh did not show the respect his office demanded, perhaps, because he knew that he was there by accident, and only at the pleasure of his party President. The moral arc of the Congress party had actually flattened that night on 25th June 1975 when Nehru’s daughter switched off the light of freedom and the darkness of Emergency pervaded the land. Though officially it was ended in March 1977, yet its miasma poisoned the very air for another 37 years until the 2014 elections gave a complete majority in the Lok Sabha to the BJP led by Narendra Modi. Admittedly, there had been periods of energy during the previous NDA terms, but these were inevitably structured around “coalition compulsions,” to use Manmohan Singh’s infamous phrase. The euphoria generated by the success of the Narendra Modi-led BJP, suddenly gave rise to new expectations and a new confidence among the suffering masses of this country who had been toiling under the crushing burdens of inflation, unemployment, corruption, insecurity, hunger, lack of education and health services, and a host of other disorders that an indifferent political and administrative dispensation had been inflicting upon them. In a land that has been brought up on a steady diet of mythological lore of divine avatars descending from their heavenly abodes to rid this earth of evil demons, it became very easy for people to believe that Modi was some kind of a 21st century avatar of Lord Krishna who had descended upon Hastinapur to rid it of its Kauravas and their evil empire. A tremendous amount of goodwill for the new PM and his team gushed forth like a torrent predicting the imminent demise of the ecosystem that had protected and nurtured the evil Queen and her court of rakshasas. Fake news traders, whose very existence depended upon this evil ecosystem, saw doom and gloom for their kind. Stories discrediting each and every decision of the new government began to appear in both print and visual media. The judiciary, the civilian bureaucracy, and the law enforcement agencies having deep-rooted connections and links with the corrupt regimes threw their combined efforts into thwarting the reforms and preventing the Modi government from delivering on the promises made during the election campaign. Being used to a flat moral arc they were unable to reconcile with the new curvature that forced them to raise their eyes from the feet of their benefactress and look ahead to a new geography where the mountains were vertical and not flat. Four-and-a-half years on, some of us may be unhappy that Modi has not “deftly” played the hand that the people have dealt him. Many of the promises remain unfulfilled – some are not even works-in-progress. But, for the first time in our history, he has given us a corruption-free government at the centre. His team may not be as energetic and committed as he is, but then one cannot expect all the fingers of a hand to be equal. The ascetic life he has led has given him the physical attributes that enable him to take the burdens of office without flinching. The Congress knows that if it has to regain power it has to somehow destroy Modi. The constant personal abuse directed at him is symptomatic of the deep frustration with his style of open and transparent governance as against the opacity of his opponents. The Congress President, not known for either hard work or political intelligence, has been resorting to outright lies, calling the PM “a thief” when he has nothing with which to substantiate his allegations. A supposedly suave, urbane spokesperson like Shashi Tharoor has become indistinguishable from a Jignesh Mewani in his language and demeanour. The moral arc has not only flattened but completely disappeared from the political spectrum of the Congress. Narendra Modi and the BJP’s arc of political realism may be imperceptible to some at the moment. What the future holds may be terrible or miraculous, but the seed is sown and we shall wait with anticipation to see what fruit it sprouts. One thing, however, is looking more and more certain. Modi will not sacrifice morality at the altar of political realism, compromising the future of the nation for short-term gains. For him, the trajectory of the moral arc is clearly visible and if we, in our ignorance and impatience fail to see it, he is not going to flatten the beam for our convenience. If we fail him now, we will have no one to blame but ourselves. Therefore, for now, by keeping our faith in him, we can hope that the arc will become manifest for us to see. I for one am confident that its trajectory will remain firmly focused in the direction of justice and will not get flattened like the Congress’s Olympus Mons that is stagnant and immobile at the top.",2018-11-02,"AAP,Congress,development,INC,India,modi government,Narendra Modi,Parliament,Politics,Prime Minister,rahul gandhi",Narendra Modi and BJP’s arc of political realism,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/narendra-modi-and-bjps-arc-of-political-realism/
250,OpIndia Staff,"At first Gujarat government tried to dismiss the wrong translation as 'fake news'.  On 31st October, Statue of Unity , world’s tallest statue, was unveiled by Prime Minister Modi to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. However, the statue got people talking for a reason other than expected. At the location of the statue, a board has been installed that carries the translations of the phrase ‘Statue of Unity’ in 10 different languages. But as soon as the pictures of the inauguration  came out people found out that the board carried the wrong translation of the phrase in Tamil. The error attracted the anger of the Tamil speaking people on Twitter. After the news went viral, a top official from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam dismissed  the image as fake. “The viral image of the erroneous Tamil translation of the Statue of Unity is a mischievous attempt by someone to tarnish the event that is a grand tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel”, the official had said. A journalist associated with BBC Gujarati, Tejas Vaidya had also photographed  the same plaque on 30th October. His photo, and also the photo posted by Gujarat CMO, shows that the Tamil text is actually masked with tape, but as the tape is semi-transparent, the text is still visible. This means that someone had already spotted the mistake before the statue was inaugurated and attempted to cover it. The mistake was admitted  by the Gujarat government later. “We had outsourced event management works to private agencies. When it was brought to our notice, we immediately blacked it out,” a government official said when contacted by ",2018-11-02,"BJP,gujarat,gujarat cm,gujarat government,sardar patel,Sardar Sarovar Dam,statue of unity,Vijay Rupani",Gujarat government to replace plaque at Statue of Unity after erroneous Tamil translation,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/gujarat-government-to-replace-plaque-at-statue-of-unity-after-erroneous-tamil-translation/
251,Shashank Goyal,"While the ideology of Congress is still deeply rooted in loyalty to one dynasty and ""nepotism"", BJP is driven only by loyalty to India and ""patriotism"". Sardar Patel’s “Statue of Unity” was recently inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi as world’s tallest statue on Oct 31, 2018. In that perspective, it may be worthwhile to revisit how various leaders of India were treated after their demise. When Ms Indira Gandhi passed away in 1984 , her ashes in urns were sent on a tour of India’s 22 states and 9 union territories by special train and aircraft to allow people to pay final respects to the leader. The remains were then returned to New Delhi and taken aboard an Indian Air Force transport aircraft, escorted by two MiG 23 jets to be scattered over the Himalayas . When Mr Rajiv Gandhi passed away in 1991 , a special train from Delhi carried the urn with his ashes. The ashes were to be immersed in the five holy lakes of Rajasthan, scattered by aeroplane  across the Himalayas and placed at other sacred sites across the nation. With due respect to the deceased, it must not be forgotten that Mr Gandhi’s tenure was badly tarnished by a multitude of issues including the escape of Warren Anderson after Bhopal Gas Tragedy  in 1984, rigging Kashmir elections in 1987 , involvement of Congress leaders in 1984 anti-Sikh riots and Rajiv Gandhi condoning the violence with his “when a big tree falls” speech , involvement of Congress’s government machinery in Hashimpura massacre  of 1987, indecisiveness on Sri Lanka policy, first supporting LTTE  in the Lankan civil war then taking a U-turn and sending IPKF  to fight LTTE in which thousands of Indian soldiers lost their lives, attempting to appease Muslim clerics through Shah Bano  ordinance and then manipulating the Ayodhya  temple issue as damage control tool for above and finally the charges of massive corruption in Bofors  scam. On the contrary, the first non-Gandhi Prime Minister from Congress to complete a full term, Mr P V Narasimha Rao had a hugely successful tenure. He ended forty-five years of estrangement with Israel  and established India’s full diplomatic ties in 1992. Today Israel is one of India’s most important partners in defence and trade. His “Look East” policy strengthened India’s trade relations with South East Asia and eventually India was also inducted as a member of ASEAN. With historic reforms of 1991, he devised the economic transformation of India that created millions of jobs and pulled hundreds of millions of Indians out of poverty.  described his contribution to modern India with the following words:Asia Times When Mr Rao passed away in 2004, Mrs Sonia Gandhi did not allow his body to be brought into Congress office for last respect by Congress workers. As quoted in Financial Express –  The first non-Congress Prime Minister to have completed full term was Mr Vajpayee. During his tenure, “Sarv Shiksha ” project was launched which provided free elementary education to children aged 6-14 years. New schools were opened, and existing ones were renovated. Within four years of its launch, the number of out-of-school children dropped by 60%. The literacy rate of India also shot up from 64.8% in 2001 to 74.04% in 2011 census. Infrastructure got a boost as the Golden Quadrilateral project was started to connect all of India’s metro cities and villages along the way. It helped improve trade with the easy movement of goods and people. With successful Pokhran nuclear test, India became a full-fledged nuclear state and became a formidable military power. India’s economy  reached new heights too. When Mr Vajpayee passed the government to UPA in 2004, the GDP was growing at 8%, inflation was below 4% and forex reserves were overflowing. On Mr Vajpayee’s death in 2018, Prime Minister Modi, his Cabinet colleagues, BJP president Mr Amit Shah, chief ministers of several BJP-governed states, senior BJP leaders and thousands of party workers followed the vehicle carrying the mortal remains of Mr Vajpayee on foot. Mr Modi defied security and walked on foot for six km. Mr Vajpayee’s ashes were then immersed in 100 rivers across India. BJP paid due respect to Mr Vajpayee after his death, but then he was one of their own. This is where the statue of unity gains significance. Mr Modi went on to build the world’s tallest statue for honouring Sardar Patel – the man who worked relentlessly to integrate 500+ princely states after independence and architect India to its present shape. It must be noted that as the first Home Minister of (Congress) Indian government, Sardar Patel had banned RSS when they were (wrongly) blamed for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. It must also be noted that while Mr Rao despite being a former Prime Minister was denied a final resting place in Delhi, Sanjay Gandhi, who never held a worthwhile public office, was laid to rest in Delhi right next to Shantivan – the resting place of Jawaharlal Nehru. When it comes to the Statue of Unity, Congress and the members of its ecosystem might insinuate that BJP is trying to hijack the legacy of Sardar Patel. Truth is that Congress respects Indian leaders only as long as they are from Gandhi family and ignores others even from their own party. BJP has shown that it rises above party politics and puts leaders who have contributed to India, on a high pedestal, even if they belong to Congress party which is their political opponent. Mr Modi and BJP did not let the political opposition come in the way of recognizing Sardar Patel and his contributions to the nation. While the ideology of Congress is still deeply rooted in loyalty to one dynasty and “nepotism”, BJP is driven only by loyalty to India and “patriotism”.",2018-11-02,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Congress,INC,Indira Gandhi,Modi,modi government,Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,rajiv gandhi,sonia gandhi,statue of unity,tribute",What Statue of Unity and treatment of various leaders after their death tells us about politics of ideology,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/what-statue-of-unity-and-treatment-of-various-leaders-after-their-death-tells-us-about-politics-of-ideology/
252,Abhishek Banerjee,"These days, whenever there is death or destruction anywhere in the country, there is always a liberal waiting to see if it can be used to create a divide among the people of India. Last night around 8:30 pm about 30 km from Tinsukia town in Upper Assam, in a horrifying terrorist attack , with five Hindu Bengalis were lined up and shot dead. Prominent Assamese journalists known for their “liberal and secular” credentials were on the case instantly, dropping hints about the politics around the National Register of Citizens (NRC). These days, whenever there is death or destruction anywhere in the country, there is always a liberal waiting to see if it can be used to create a divide among the people of India. It could even be a natural disaster, such as floods in Kerala . Liberals will find a way to divide. And the birds of the ecosystem are known for their keen ability to identify the smell of death. This is a terrorist attack, suspected to have been carried out by ULFA. Is it too much to ask that liberals stay away from the politics of dividing people when a terrorist attack happens? Forget about petty journalists. The elected CM of Bengal waded right into the matter, playing the ethnic hatred card right away. From Day 1, Mamata Banerjee has been trying to project the NRC  issue as some kind of ethnic conflict between Assamese and Bengali people of India. It is not. It is simply a matter of illegal immigrants who have wrongfully settled inside our borders. And whether the illegal immigrants have struck roots in India or been here for generations does not matter. They  In public discourse, we need to have absolute clarity over the situation with illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. And I believe I can speak with some extra passion on this matter being a Bengali myself. We had a Partition back in 1947. We did not ask for that Partition. The people on the other side asked for it. They got their separate country, their “land of the pure.” They need to respect that and stay on their side. We don’t owe them anything now. But, from elected Chief Ministers to the PIL mafia, the liberal ecosystem, its leaders, enablers and handlers have been trying to confuse the public over illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. This is how the liberal ecosystem works. Who was running this country when hordes of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh came flooding into Assam? It was the great Bharat Ratna Prime Ministers of the Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty. Naturally, the huge influx unnerved the people of Assam. There was violence everywhere. But the Congress had nothing to worry about. Remember that back in the day, it must have been super easy for illegal immigrants from Bangladesh to infiltrate the electoral rolls. Who do you think got their votes? Then, in 1985, Rajiv Gandhi reached an agreement with the leaders of the Assam movement, known as the “Assam Accord.” First of all, the Assam Accord of 1985 was in itself an unfair compromise into which the people of Assam were forced. The Accord legalized all foreigners who had entered Assam before a certain cutoff date in 1971. For the rest of India, that date is set at Jan 26, 1950, or the first Republic Day. For the people of Assam, the upside of the Assam Accord was that the government would create the National Register of Citizens (NRC). But the NRC promise was never kept. Not until the BJP government came to power in Assam in May 2016! And now the liberal & secular ecosystem is opposing the NRC. They say it’s been too long since the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh have been here. That it’s some kind of humanitarian issue! Who betrayed the people of Assam repeatedly from 1950 to 2016? The ‘liberals’ and their leaders did! Who delayed the NRC from 1985 to 2016? The ‘liberals’ did! Who now wants the illegal immigrants to stay for humanitarian reasons? The ‘liberals’ do! Who will get the votes if these illegal immigrants are naturalized as citizens of India? The ‘liberals’ and their beloved Congress! In fact, they don’t even stop there. Mamata Banerjee now intends to milk the sense of hurt and grievance among Assamese people to get more votes from Bengalis for the TMC! At each stage, one generation of secular leaders betrays the people of this country. And the next generation finds a way to recycle this betrayal into political gains for themselves.

A bench of Justice A. K. Sikri, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Ajay Rastogi approved  the appeal of Anurag Thakur, Dhumal and Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association challenging the Himachal Pradesh High Court order of April 25, 2014, refusing to quash the FIR lodged against them and stay the criminal trial pending before the special judge, Dharamshala.

In a previous hearing, Virbhadra Singh had contended before the court that in the year 2002, the Dhumal government had leased 16 acres of land at the rate of Rs 1 per year to Thakur for 99 years. He clarified that it was not a political matter but that of irregularities and the police had taken action on it. He requested the court that the appeal of Thakur should be rejected and the stay on the trial against all the accused should be lifted. The former Himachal government had registered a total of 7 cases in this matter out which 2 were quashed by the High Court. The lawyer representing the Himachal government had told the court that the government has decided to withdraw all politically motivated cases. The court had asked the government whether the case of Thakur was one such case. And If yes, then how. The court also had asked whether the case could be withdrawn. To this, the counsel of the Himachal government said that he would come with instructions from the government. The court had asked Thakur whether he wanted to argue the matter or the court should permit the state government to withdraw the case from the lower court. Thakur had chosen to argue the matter before the court, after which the court fixed a final hearing in the matter.

Joining the chorus for Ram Temple, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav has strongly batted  in favour of building a Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Talking to the media, she expressed her desire to see a Ram Temple in Ayodhya and said that she believes the court will hand out the verdict in favour of building the temple. Aparna Yadav, who contested 2017 polls as an SP candidate and lost, will be backing uncle Shivpal Singh’s Pragatishal Samajwadi Party Lohia (PSPL) and would be contesting the elections in 2019 from the same. Although, she said that her father-in-law’s blessings are always with her. The UP elections 2017 brought to the fore the latent rift between Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav. It was widely assumed that Mulayam Singh would grasp the nettle and broker a peace accord between the two internecine warring factions and somehow keep the flock together but that didn’t happen. The two factions peacefully parted their ways with Shivpal Singh Yadav forming his own party PSPL. Though Mulayam Singh Yadav is seen frequenting SP’s monthly meets, Shivpal Yadav exclaims that his brother’s blessings are with him. This puts an ordinary citizen in quandary. If Mulayam Singh Yadav supports SP, then how can he bless Shivpal Singh Yadav and Aparna Yadav for PSPL party’s success? Is the division of SP into two factions just a charade to fool people? It might as well be a masterclass stratagem by Mulayam Singh Yadav to continue garnering Muslim votes through SP and try to venture into tapping Hindu communities hitherto ignored by the SP by floating a new party with aggressive Hindutva agenda under his brother’s leadership. In all likelihood this schism is just a smokescreen, both parties will probably form an alliance before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Shivpal Singh Yadav has even urged  Mulayam Singh Yadav to become his party’s prime ministerial candidate. Mulayam Singh Yadav, since the days of his chief ministership in UP during the 1990s, has been known to be close to the Muslim community. In 2017, he stood  by his decision he took on October 30, 1990, to ask the forces to fire upon the karsevaks marching towards Ayodhya. If this wasn’t enough, adding insult to the injury, Mulayam Singh Yadav quipped, “If more people were required to be killed for the sake of the country’s unity and integrity, the security forces would have done it.” He earned the sobriquet ‘Mullah Mulayam’ by the Muslim community for issuing orders to fire at karsevaks. On the other hand, his younger daughter-in-law, Aparna has been pretty vocal about her Hindu roots and has not shied away from expressing her opinions about matters concerning Hindus, even if that meant defying her party’s viewpoint. A few months back, she lambasted  Mamata Banerjee for supporting predominantly Muslim illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. However, with such contrasting credentials established by her father-in-law Mulayam Singh Yadav, it becomes a tad difficult for an average Hindu to take whatever Aparna Yadav says at face value. The party has no definite stand on Ram Temple but evades the issue to appease its vote bank. If Aparna Yadav really wants Hindus to believe sincerity in her wish to see a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, she should first get senior SP leader Mulayam Yadav to apologise for his ordered “massacre” in which 56 karsevaks were killed and then champion the cause of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Champing at the bit of furnishing one’s Hindu credentials is in vogue these days among politicians of different hues. Congress organises Temple run  drives for its president Rahul Gandhi in election-bound states in order to emphasise their Hindu creds. Other parties who once despised being associated with Hinduism are aggressively trying to pursue Hindu votaries. If one thing that trumps everything else that Modi has been successful in, it is this rekindling of the moribund spirit of Hinduism in the country. The country in which hitherto talking about Hinduism and slamming minority appeasement were considered as cardinal sins is finally seems to have overcome the guilt it was conditioned to in reclaiming its cultural heritage. Samajwadi Party is facing tough headwinds from Yogi’s BJP in Uttar Pradesh. The party is in crosshairs with its old ally Congress and like Mayawati’s BSP, it too had decided to go to the assembly polls in the 5 states without entering an alliance with Congress. Moreover, the party is actively considering forming an alliance  with its arch-rival BSP in these states. It is but obvious, in such a gloomy scenario, Samajwadi Party is trying to play safe by hedging its bets and appeasing every community to widen its appeal among the electorate. Floating two separate parties might well be a key to achieving this end. Aparna Yadav seems to be a staunch Hindu but there appears a visible incongruency in her party’s disposition towards Hindus. The senior party leaders like Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav have based their entire politics on despising Hindus and appeasing minorities.  If they are thinking their duplicity won’t be noticed, then they are grossly mistaken. Mulayam Singh Yadav will have to shun this double-dealing and be definitive on his stance on Ram Mandir or it will be a classic case of chasing two rabbits and catching none for the Samajwadi Party. Samajwadi party ideologues have, so far, been successful in underplaying these incongruencies but they need to understand that the new-age Hindu is not going to take their incongruencies lying down. Their moves are carefully been watched and assessed by them. Unless they sincerely enunciate their stance vis-à-vis Hindus, such diversionary tactics of subterfuge will only serve to diminish their political significance.",2018-11-02,"Akhilesh Yadav,Aparna Yadav,Mulayam Singh Yadav,Ram Janmabhoomi,samajwadi party,sp","Samajwadi Party: Family feud, genuine disharmony or organised skulduggery?",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/samajwadi-party-aparna-mulayam-akhilesh-yadav-ram-mandir-family-feud-genuine-disharmony-or-organised-skulduggery/
256,Guest Author,"As a youth who aspires to be a cog in the nation-building, those two hours of the Prime Minister's speech have strengthened my belief that India is all set to unfurl the flag of the prosperity whose echo will resonate throughout the globe. I firmly believe that “Information Technology by Indian Talent will make the India Tomorrow” sooner than soon. These were the words of the Prime Minister during a town hall meeting with IT professionals on the launch of “Self4Society”. The compassion in these words must have captivated every listener. Upon listening to this address, one realises that the Prime Minister believes in the strength of small gestures creating deep impacts and who want to run the engine of the nation with the fuel of “Jan Bhagidari”. The honesty with which the PM answered the questions during his interaction is appreciable. In a candid conversation, he said that “Sarkaar can’t do things which Sanskriti can” and it is our “Sanskriti” which drives the social change. For many, the responsibility as a citizen ends with paying taxes. But as the PM mentioned, It is only when we take a leap forward ourselves and go beyond rules, that the inner joy and satisfaction is achieved. The Prime Minister speaks to passionately about service to others that it is bound to leave an indelible mark on a youngsters thought process. The fact that social service is a two-way learning process, where not only the beneficiary gets impacted but we too get empowered in the process. The sight of young technology professionals leaving behind the comforts of their plush offices and venturing into the social sector is just one manifestation of sweeping social reforms taking place in our nation. It was inspiring for the young minds to know that the highest leadership of the country acknowledges the innovations being carried out by individuals as well as the social startups for the vulnerable section of the society. Making a confession and giving a moment of celebration to the committed youth, the PM mentioned that the government follows in the footsteps of these visionary social entrepreneurs and wants their individual efforts to collude to work in a hand-in-glove manner to bring a change. Feats like Swachh Bharat or financial inclusion from the remotest corners of the country speaks volume about our changing India. Reforms reaching the poorest of the poor and those standing at the end of the queue reflects on the impact of the technologically driven vision of the leadership of the country. The Prime Minister has always connected with the youth of the country far more than the self-proclaimed “youth icons” like Rahul Gandhi who is widely considered as a reluctant politician who is “in the business” only because of his last name. PM Modi knows the power of technology in empowering the citizens and wants the youngsters to leverage it for nation building in every possible aspect. One fine example is the historic JAM Trinity which has resulted in mass financial inclusion, and has given birth to a new facet i.e, “Garibo Ki Amiri” because of whopping savings of Rs. 80,000 crores in the Jan Dhan bank accounts. Digital India is the genie in the bottle who fulfilled this wish of financial inclusion and made JAM Trinity a reality for India. This genie made mobile phones and internet connection a household name. This only genie made Direct Benefit Transfer scheme a success, which uplifted the most vulnerable in the most unreachable locations of the country. This is the genie which gave the policies of e-Hospital, e-Vidyalaya, and e-NAM a lease of life. The Prime Minister doesn’t mince words when he speaks of social change driven by mass movement, technology and innovation. As a youth who aspires to be a cog in the nation-building, those two hours of the Prime Minister’s speech have strengthened my belief that India is all set to unfurl the flag of the prosperity whose echo will resonate throughout the globe.

257,Nirwa Mehta,"Seems like Divya Spandana is done with taking the criticism on behalf of Congress Congress IT cell head Divya Spandana had a major meltdown on Twitter after people, including Congress-friendly journalists, pointed out that her tweet comparing PM Modi to ‘bird pooping’  was not in good taste. She took to Twitter to let the world know that she, as a former member of parliament and Congress party’s social media and digital communication in-charge, does not ‘give two hoots’ about the views of the voters. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. When Hurricane Birdie hit Twitter, no one, including Congress-friendly journalists could escape the ire. First, she accused The Wire ‘s Rohini Singh , who called out Divya’s tweet as being distasteful, of having a ‘dirty mind’. Then she corrected herself and accused Singh of having a ‘convoluted, manipulative, dirty mind’. Ouch. Next to come in the line of fire was Shekhar Coup.. err. Shekhar Gupta of ThePrint. Gupta had wondered aloud that first Divya had ‘ruined further the taste of our already rotten political discourse’ after which Divya went on to insult our collective intelligence. He then wondered if this is the decency Rahul meant when he had hugged PM Modi ? Triggered, Divya Spandana pointed out that Gupta talking of standards is more like the kettle calling the pot black. The next casualty of the fury was NDTV ‘s Nidhi Razdan . At first Congress-friendly ‘journalist’, Pallavi Ghosh  had ‘clarified’ from her ‘sources’ that Divya’s tweet was not in reference to PM Modi. Right after the ‘clarification’ from Ghosh, Nidhi tweeted how Congress sources say that the party does not approve of the language used by Divya. Shocked at Divya’s brazenness, Nidhi again tweeted how Divya, who holds an official position in the Congress, cannot absolve herself of the responsibility of telling the nation what exactly she meant by her tweet. Divya hit out on Nidhi and refused to offer any further explanation. Nidhi, as a responsible citizen of India who votes, was shocked at being referred to as a monkey. Not taking the slow comprehension skills  of Nidhi lying down, Divya suggested Nidhi visits Srinagar to feel better. One wonders why Divya suggested that Nidhi visits Srinagar specifically. To that, Nidhi retorted at how she wishes she could do that, but she has an actual job to do, because of which she couldn’t. A friendly reminder: A few weeks back Twitter was abuzz with speculation  of promotion/punishment of Divya Spandana after she changed her bio on the Twitter profile, removing her designation as Congress IT cell head. This infighting between ‘journalists’ who are overtly sympathetic towards Rahul Gandhi, and Divya Spandana who is considered to be a close aide of Rahul Gandhi, is only furthering speculation that all might not be well within Congress and this might be an indirect message to Divya that her time in the party is up. Not taking the job-jibe lying down, Divya responded in kind. So, if Nidhi, who has a job with NDTV, is lucky to have a job, as ‘few’ people have one, one wonders whether Divya is a lucky one or the unlucky one?",2018-11-01,"congress IT cell,divya spandana,Narendra Modi,nidhi razdan,Prime Minister Modi,rahul gandhi,rohini singh,shekhar gupta","Congress IT cell head’s Twitter meltdown, Congress-friendly ‘journalists’ come in the line of fire",https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/congress-it-cell-heads-twitter-meltdown-congress-friendly-journalists-come-in-the-line-of-fire/
258,OpIndia Staff,"Supreme Court clarified that the High Court was only the concerned case and it does not establish a precedent The Supreme Court, in a hearing held on Friday, stayed  an order of the Delhi High Court that restricted the power of the Election Commission (EC) to act against paid news. The stay will allow EC to crack down on the instances of paid news in the five states going to poll next month. The Election Commission had filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court Division Bench order contending that motivated propaganda by politicians published in newspapers cannot be considered part of their fundamental right to free speech. The EC had petitioned that the order of the High Court should be limited only to the concerned case and it should be treated as a precedent, A division bench of the Delhi High Court had set aside an Election Commission order which disqualified Narottam Mishra, an MLA from Datia constituency in Madhya Pradesh after it claimed to have established 42 cases of ‘paid news’ in the newspapers in the run-up to polls in 2008. The division bench in its order said that the Election Commission was attempting to exercise indirect control over the freedom of speech of the candidates. Para 77 of the order read, “Election Commission’s remit cannot ordinarily extend to judging content of speech; it is only to adjudge whether the election expenses incurred by the candidate or someone on her or his behalf, under her or his authority have been accounted” for. In para 76 of the order states that the EC had “erred in interpreting” various laws and failed to establish that Narottam Mishra, a BJP minister in Madhya Pradesh, was responsible for the publication of 42 offending articles/features/ election appeals. “The content of a media article, or a news feature or series of features on particular candidates, should ordinarily not be regulated indirectly through the directives of the EC; they essentially fall within the domain of free speech. Any indirect control would impact a citizen’s right to free speech and expression. Such indirect control would chill the right and freeze all debates — essential to democracy,” the court observed. The Supreme Court clarified that sections 76 and 77 of the High Court order are related only to the case of Narottam Mishra, and it does establish any precedent for other decisions of EC in the context of paid news. The Supreme Court’s order on the Delhi High Court judgement is crucial in view of the upcoming elections in the five states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Telangana.

As Chhattisgarh heads towards assembly elections, many villages in the Naxal-infested areas such as Dantewada are witnessing installation of polling booths for the first time since India’s independence. As per an ANI report, Katekalyan’s Talem village of Dantewada is one of such villages to see polling booth set up for the first time. The locals of the area are particularly enthused by the latest development and have expressed their willingness to cast their vote. The police in charge at Katekalyan police station has expressed that the police force faces daunting challenges but said that they are ready. In a step forward, the villagers are also connecting with the police. It is pertinent to note that the violence in the Naxal-infested Dantewada region has spiked after the announcement by the EC of conducting elections in the region and attempting to bring the tribals into the fold of mainstream. Yesterday, the Naxals attacked  a patrolling party in Anantpur area of Dantewada in which Doordarshan TV crew member Achutyananda Sahu lost his life and two CRPF personnel were martyred as well.

260,Research Team,"As a Prime Minister of India, her accomplishments and failures are quite well known. However, there are certain aspects of her regime that have not garnered much attention. There are some other startling revelations that were made in Wikileaks cables. On the 31st of October, 34 years ago, the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by members of her own security. As a Prime Minister of India, her accomplishments and failures are quite well known. However, there are certain aspects of her regime that have not garnered much attention. There are some other startling revelations that were made in Wikileaks cables. In 2013 it was revealed that Indira Gandhi was willing to share India’s nuclear technology with Pakistan after its first nuclear test in 1974. The US embassy quoted  her as saying, “I have explained in my letter to Prime Minister Bhutto the peaceful nature and the economic purposes of this experiment and have also stated that India is willing to share her nuclear technology with Pakistan in the same way she is willing to share it with other countries, provided proper conditions for understanding and trust are created. I once again repeat this assurance.” There also appears to a genuine desire to assuage Pakistan’s concern regarding India’s nuclear tests. One cable  mentions that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi wrote to her Pakistani counterpart that India’s nuclear tests did not constitute any threat to Pakistan. However, it also mentions that as far the author of the cable is concerned, they can confirm that the letter only stressed that scientific experiments by India should not be allowed to become a controversy. In another letter  to her Pakistani counterpart, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi elaborated on India’s opposition to the US resuming its arms supplies to Pakistan. “We have regretted this decision because it threatens to increase tensions in our region,” she wrote. The letter also reveals that after India’s war with Pakistan in 1971, Indira Gandhi did seek to establish peace between the two countries. Imploring the Pakistani administration to desist from creating an arms race in the region and maintain an environment that could felicitate cooperation, she insisted that both sides must be more cautious about their public posturing. She wrote, “We feel strongly that both our countries must desist from propaganda against each other. Nothing can be more damaging to the prospects of cooperation and the fulfilment of agreements already reached than the resumption of hostile public postures. From our side, I can assure you we will do nothing to encourage suspicion and hostility towards Pakistan and I hope your government will also exercise similar restraints.” In 2013, it was by WikiLeaks cables that the USA had a mole inside Indira’s inner circle who is constantly referred to as a “household” source. In a US Embassy cable that claimed Sanjay Gandhi and her secretary R.K. Dhawan was the figured behind the imposition of emergency, it is said , “This is confirmed by a source close to the PM’s household. Both are non-ideological, extremely authoritarian in their general approach, and focused only on keeping Mrs Gandhi in power.” A year later, a WikiLeaks cable showed that Rajiv Gandhi’s close friend Subramanian Swamy was passing some information. The cable says , “Subramanian Swamy suggested to department officer ten days ago that he heard Mrs Gandhi was prompted to set the March election date because she wanted to square things away in view of her failing health.” There was also a concern in Washington regarding what they perceived as India’s duplicity. A cable  talks about the India government under Indira Gandhi being very vocal in public in its criticism of the US military presence at Vietnam but mentions Hurbert Humphrey, the then Vice President and Democratic Party nominee for US Presidential Elections 1968, claiming that Indira Gandhi had told him in private that “It was absolutely essential that we (American Forces) were there”. The said cable also reveals that the Americans believed the Indian government looked up to the United States to keep China under check. The cable also indicates that the Indians recognized the Chinese threat much earlier than the Americans. The cable further states, “India, it is sometimes hinted, protests against the US presence at Diego Garcia for form’s sake and to please its Parliament and that in reality, the Indians are glad that the US is there to check the growing Soviet power in the region.” Another cable reveals that foreign powers were concerned about Indira’s Gandhi rhetoric that foreign powers were meddling with internal affairs of the country. Their “concern” and “dismay” was conveyed  to the Government of India through Ambassador Saxbe and that they were evidently “disturbed”. Ambassador Saxbe can be seen saying  in a separate cable, “In the best light, Mrs Gandhi’s elections could be seen as pre-election rhetoric; they could also be seen as justification for not holding elections.” Most startling revelations that were made by WikiLeaks on Indira Gandhi, however, as we have reported  earlier, were the instances of the massive corruption in the Indira Gandhi government. The now unclassified cables reveal that there was bribery involved as well as deliberate tweaking of tenders so that the contract was always awarded to a preordained bidder. It was also observed that punishment for bribery was “rare” but if there was a politician from the opposition camp involved in bribery, then there was strict punishment.",2018-10-31,"Congress,Congress corruption,Indira Gandhi,USA,wikileaks","Indira Gandhi and 5 lesser known Wikileaks cables: Of Nuclear technology, corruption and foreign relations",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/indira-gandhi-and-5-lesser-known-wikileaks-cables-of-nuclear-technology-corruption-and-foreign-relations/

Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar has been suffering from pancreatic cancer  and has been undergoing treatment for the same. However, the chief minister’s ailment has not stopped the opposition politicians from making crass comments. Days after Congress leader asked the BJP to either ‘show Parrikar in person or conduct his Shraddh (death ceremony)’ Aam Aadmi Party MLA Alka Lamba  made an insensitive comment on his health. In a tweet which is now deleted, Lamba asked Parrikar to ‘disclose the truth’ about Rafale. She asked Parrikar to not stay quiet. “You won’t believe how many blessings you will get,” she said. Citing a popular Hindi proverb, she said, “Jahan dawa kaam nahin aati, wahan dua zarur kaam aati hai.” Meaning, where medicines don’t work, prayers do. Aam Aadmi Party leaders have a history of making morbid statements devoid of any sensitivity. While Lamba has displayed lack of remorse  after stalling rescue operations during a fire at Chandni Chowk, Delhi, by laughing about it on Twitter, Arvind Kejriwal’s wife, Sunita Kejriwal had given a veiled threat  to the Delhi LG Anil Baijal on Twitter. After her nephew Vinay Bansal was arrested in the PWD scam , Sunita Kejriwal had hit out on Baijal and asked him to stop ‘harassing’ her widow sister ‘besides the constant harassment of AAP government’ as the former Delhi LG Najeeb Jung is ‘suffering from severe illness and he regretted what he did with AAP government’. She had said that karma never leaves the karta. But Lamba’s comments are not too surprising since Aam Aadmi Party and its members have a penchant for creating a nuisance. In June this year, during a protest march against the Delhi LG Anil Baijal carried out by Aam Aadmi Party supporters, a poster had reportedly  been spotted which read as an ‘appeal’ by all Delhi citizens. ‘Delhi demands before Atal, take away Anil’. The poster referred to Atal Bihari Vajpayee , former Prime Minister of India, who was undergoing treatment. Vajpayee passed away on 16th August this year. However, Aam Aadmi Party leaders are not the only ones to link Rafale with Parrikar’s health. Earlier, in a desperate measure, Congress had tried to float a conspiracy  connecting Parrikar continuing as a chief minister despite his ailment to ‘Rafale secrets’.

The Maharashtra wing of the All India Professional Congress (AIPC) has organized an AIPC interactive that will feature Retired Supreme Court Justice Chelameswar in conversation with Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha on the 2nd of November on the issue of dissent and democracy. In January earlier this year, Justice Chelameswar along with 3 other judges of the Supreme Court had written  a letter to the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra and had held a press conference to communicate “their failed efforts” to convince the CJI to protect the institution. The letter appeared to say that the established principle that the CJI is merely the first among equals and not a “superior authority”, has not been adhered to by the current CJI.

The letter also makes reference to the opaqueness of the current collegium system. The unprecedented press conference had created a political storm leading various legal luminaries to slam the move. Justice Chelameswar had also met  with CPI MP D Raja drawing interesting reactions from people across the political spectrum. Not too long ago, Justice Chelameswar was embroiled in a head-on clash  with the then CJI Dipak Misra after a 5 judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court (which consisted of the CJI himself) overturned Justice Chelameswar headed bench’s order in the Orissa HC judge bribery case.",2018-11-01,"chelameswar,Congress,judges,Justice Chelmeswar,Maharashtra,Professionals,sanjay jha,supreme court",Retired Supreme Court Judge to speak on dissent and democracy at Congress event,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/retired-supreme-court-judge-to-speak-on-dissent-and-democracy-at-congress-event/
266,Jinit Jain,"Omar Abdullah, fuming at the name of 'Modi vests' tweeted that Modi had usurped Nehru jacket's name and has started calling it Modi vests. In a major endorsement to ‘Make in India’ initiative, the President of the Republic of Korea, Moon Jae-in has taken to his Twitter account to laud Indian traditional wear and thanked Modi for the kind gesture of sending customised ‘Modi Vests’, meticulously tailored to fit him. He also said that the Modi vests conform with the Korean dressing sense and can be worn easily in Korea. During his official visit to India, President Moon Jae-in was particularly impressed by the vests worn by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and had complemented PM Modi for the same. Taking bonhomie to another level and acknowledging Moon Jae-in’s complement, PM Modi gifted him a few customised Modi vests, all scrupulously tailored to fit him. President Moon Jae-in was also touched by PM Modi’s thoughtful message in Korean on Twitter after winning the Seoul Peace Prize. He congratulated PM Modi on this accomplishment. But this seems to have not gone down well with the known Modi detractors. Omar Abdullah, fuming at the name of ‘Modi vests’ tweeted that Modi had usurped Nehru jacket’s name and has started calling it Modi vests. Clearly, those who have attributed every small thing that the country did since independence to Gandhi-Nehru dynasty are fazed by an outsider who is making India proud with his sense of diplomacy and realpolitik. Ashok Swain, a congenital Modi hater, and a known dynasty supporter undermined PM Modi by saying that he can never be Nehru and took a cheap jibe at him. Evidently, the tweets by Korean President expressing gratitude to the PM Modi for sending him ‘Modi Vests’  have rubbed a section of self-proclaimed intellectuals the wrong way. President of Korea, Moon Jae-in was on an official 3-day visit to India in July this year. The two leaders had bilateral talks on a wide range of issues and later delivered a joint statement.  The two leaders also addressed India-South Korea CEOs and held extensive talks at the roundtable. PM Modi asserted that South Korean companies are not only strengthening ‘Make in India’ initiative but are also generating employment opportunities in India. He thanked the South Korean president for his cooperation.

267,Ashish Shukla,"So far, I believed in the pictures of Rahul Gandhi, skull cap and all, in Iftar party breaking his fast, so to speak, at sunset during a day in the Ramadan month. Now, I read he said on Tuesday in Indore, that his party is one of Hinduism. If I was an Indian Muslim, I would have a whole lot of questions today and certainly no answers. So far, I believed in the pictures of Rahul Gandhi, skull cap and all, in Iftar party breaking his fast, so to speak, at sunset during a day in the Ramadan month. Now, I read he said  on Tuesday in Indore that his party is one of Hinduism. It raised a whole lot of issues to my mind. Does Congress stand for Muslims, Dalits, Hindus or everyone? So far I have been told the only protectors Muslims have are Congress. They engineered a special protection for my Jammu and Kashmir brethren and sisters in Indian Constitution. They stood up for Sharia during the Shah Bano case; are most determined for Rohingya refugees; paralyzed the country on Kathua tragedy; stalled the Triple Talaq bill, spotlight every single–half or full–lynching incident in the remotest hamlets of the country. Rahul Gandhi even called Congress a ‘Muslim party’ a while ago. Now they say they are one of Hinduism. All this while, they dubbed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as sectarian and communal even though Narendra Modi never once said he stood only for Hindus. Isn’t Rahul Gandhi now being communal by opening claiming his party is one of Hinduism a few weeks after he said that Congress is a Muslim party and a few years after he said that mythical ‘Hindu terrorists’ are more dangerous than LeT? Isn’t it polarizing the communities? Widening the gulf of fear and insecurity between practitioners of two religions? Is this the vision of One India or daring of a burglar who wishes to rob the home of 1.3 billions of all its valuables? Then I look at my newspapers. My day begins with Indian Express, the “journalism of courage.” For the last four years and a half, they have reported every single incident against the Muslim community, and Dalits, with sincerity and not a little bit of imagination and creativity. They have marked anniversaries of Dadri, Pehlu or a Junaid by sacrificing the space for news of their front pages. They made sure the Muslim community didn’t forget for a single day the crimes which have been committed against them during the Modi regime (Nor did they Una or Bhima-Koregaon on behalf of Dalits). Indian Express seemed seriously concerned about the future of Indian Muslims. Who can forget their “And they killed Yakub” headline? And now look at them – now that Rahul Gandhi has jumped the ship, to my eyes at least, Indian Express choose to completely blank out his Indore comment in the 31st October’s edition. Why didn’t they report Rahul Gandhi for his communal and polarizing comment? Why did they desert millions of Indian Muslims who dread a majoritarian narrative in this country? Could Indian Express be said to be standing up to the idea of secular, free and equal India? Just imagine if Modi had said BJP stands only for Hinduism? (They haven’t allowed him to live down the Kabristan-Shamsaan speech to this day). If I could ask Indian Express why for a similar offence, BJP is communal and Congress is not. Why give ammunition to right-wingers who claim there is never a pro-Hindu story on your front pages? Why make even your die-hard fans like me and other Indian Muslims doubt your sincerity when you sweep Rahul Gandhi’s all-for-Hinduism comment under the carpet? I’ve tried to give my faith in Indian Express a second chance. What if their reporter truly missed the Indore event? Extremely unlikely for Rahul didn’t offer his comment in private. It was a press conference. Even if their reporter missed the event, news agencies such as PTI must have brought the news on their teleprinters. On close inspection, I even find this Indore press conference of offensive-comment buried inside  their newspaper on Page 8. Then why did you throw a cloak on this Rahul remark? Why have double standards on BJP and Congress? If you care about Indian Muslims or the idea of India that you numb our minds daily with, why avoid the searchlight on Mr Rahul Gandhi? Is that an editorial policy or a direction you receive from “Above”? And who’s this “Above”? Does this “Above” have the welfare of Indian Muslims or India as a whole in mind? These are all very disturbing questions that Indian Muslims should ask. I hope Indian Express takes these fears in the form of questions to Rahul Gandhi. Ask its editorial writers from JNU and Ashoka University; Kancha Ilaiahs or Apoorvanands, to prove they truly speak for minorities. Scratch the surface of Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor who are never out of your reach, or representation, in their newspaper on a daily basis. They could even evoke write-ups from retired professionals such as Justice Fali S. Nariman or Chelameswar, ex-cop Julio Ribeiro, ex-election commissioner S.Y. Quraishi etc who don’t even need an invitation to fill their editorial pages. After all, Indian Express is “journalism of courage.” They profess to stand up for minorities. They claim to care for a “free and secular India”.",2018-11-01,"anti hindu,Congress lies,hindu,indian express,Media,Muslim,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Sarcasm,Soft Hindutva",Rahul Gandhi now leaves Indian Muslims in the lurch,https://www.opindia.com/2018/11/rahul-gandhi-now-leaves-indian-muslims-in-the-lurch/
268,K Bhattacharjee,"The conduct of Prashant Bhushan also led the Supreme Court to express grave concern over the rising misuse of PILs in its Judge Loya verdict.  In earlier reports, we have discussed the manner in which PILs have become the latest weapon in the arm of activists who seek to impose their ideology on Indian citizens with assistance from a Judiciary that is sympathetic to their worldview. One name that inevitably comes to mind whenever PILs are being discussed is a lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan. In this article, we shall explore the numerous PILs that the activist has either filed or represented in the Court as an advocate in pursuit of ideological victory. In recent times, Bhushan has been associated with a host of PILs which have wide-ranging consequences on a variety of issues. Most recently, he was the advocate  for a petitioner who sought a collegium-like system in the appointment of members of the Election Commission. The Supreme Court bench which heard it decided to refer the petition to a 5-judge Constitution Bench. It might surprise Indians but it turns out even Rohingyas in the country, people who the government maintains are illegally here in the country, can file PILs in courts to prevent legal action against them. Mohammed Salimullah, a Rohingya, filed  a petition in the Supreme seeking a stay on the government’s decision to deport 7 Rohingyas through advocate Prashant Bhushan. The Supreme Court, however, refused  to stay the government’s decision. Prashant Bhushan involved himself in the CBI feud that has ensued as well. The petition, filed by NGO Common Cause where Bhushan is a member of the Governing Council, sought  a court-monitored SIT investigation into the alleged malpractices within the CBI. It is also pertinent to mention that a petition was filed by the same NGO against the appointment of R.K. Asthana as the Special Director of the CBI. The NGO Common Cause, through Bhushan, had also filed  an interim application in the Courts accusing Prime Minister Modi of taking bribes. The Court had dismissed the application stating that the documents which were presented in the court as evidence were inadmissible as they were neither credible nor reliable. Bhushan later insinuated  that the Court was scared of big corporates. On another occasion, Prashant Bhushan had appeared  for Admiral Ramdas who had reportedly filed a PIL against the appointment of IPS officer Sharad Kumar as the Vigilance Commissioner in the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The Court while dismissing the petition chose to remind the litigants that PILs are for the poor. In 2016, Adv. Prashant Bhushan had appeared  in the Supreme Court on behalf of Common Cause and S.P. Udaykumar, an anti-nuclear activist who was charged with sedition for his involvement with the protests against the Koodankulam Nuclear Project. The petitioners had alleged that the sedition laws were being misused to routinely persecute students, journalists and intellectuals. The advocate also steers an organization called the Center for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL). The Supreme Court in 2016 was quite flummoxed with the fact that filing PILs was the sole activity of an NGO. The bench headed by then Chief Justice T.S. Thakur said , “Prashant Bhushan, you have an image of a crusader. But can you become the centre for public interest litigation? Can the system be taken for a ride in such a manner? We cannot allow this.” While dismissing a host of PILs seeking a probe into the death of Judge Loya, the Supreme Court slammed Prashant Bhushan and his NGO CPIL saying  “attempts were made to misrepresent and mislead the court by manufacturing evidence to cast a doubt on the circumstances leading to the death of judge Loya”. The conduct of Prashant Bhushan also led the Supreme Court to express grave concern  over the rising misuse of PILs in its Judge Loya verdict. “The misuse of public interest litigation is a serious matter of concern for the judicial process. It is a travesty of justice for the resources of the legal system to be consumed by an avalanche of misdirected petitions purportedly filed in the public interest which, upon due scrutiny, are found to promote a personal, business or political agenda.” It is reported  that Bhushan has argued over 300 PILs in the Courts. While he has seen a significant amount of success with his judicial activism in matters such as the 2G scam and Radia Tapes, it appears that he has tasted only bitter defeat of late.",2018-10-30,"judge loya,judicial activism,judiciary,PIL,prashant bhushan,SC,supreme court",The eternal romance: Prashant Bhushan and PILs,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/the-eternal-romance-prashant-bhushan-and-pils/

There has been a recent storm brewing on Twitter where several right-leaning commentators are vexed about the increasing display of political bias by the platform. Earlier, Twitter CEO had admitted that its employees have a left-leaning bias . And repeated suspensions of right-leaning accounts have only strengthened the suspicion that Twitter is selectively targeting based on ideology. Today, a popular right-leaning spoof maker, @Spook_Junkie was suspended  for inexplicable reasons. This had angered many who questioned the basis of this bias. Post the suspension, several right-leaning handles started looking for the root of this political bias. They dug up many tweets of Mahima Kaul who is the Director of Policy at Twitter India. The tweets were severely anti-Modi, pro-Rahul Gandhi and according to many, indicated Kaul’s own political bias that they said explains Twitter India’s ideologically biased approach. When these tweets started being dug up, Kaul allegedly deleted several of them. There were several deleted tweets where Kaul was seen using strong and derogatory language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Someone also pointed out that Mahima Kaul, who is the Director of Policy at Twitter, instead of suspending the hate mongering handle @AmbedkarCaravan that regularly spews venom against Hindus, was following him.

270,Nirwa Mehta,"Finally waking up to a common man's heartache on seeing how a potato chips packet contains more air than potato chips, Rahul Gandhi's brilliant display of business sense left the nation awestruck. Congress President Rahul Gandhi has moved on from connecting MRI machines  and has now decided to take the case of potato chips packets. While addressing a rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi addressed the lifetime rue of potato chips-lovers. “Pick up a potato chips packet. How much does potato cost today? Rs. 5. How much is a potato chips packet sold for? How much of it is a potato? Only half a potato goes in it. How much does a farmer get out of the potato chips packet? 50 paisa or sometimes not even that,” Rahul Gandhi said today in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh. Finally waking up to a common man’s heartache on seeing how a potato chips packet contains more air than potato chips, Rahul Gandhi’s brilliant display of business sense baffled a lot of Twitter users. And some people who could not empathise with others as much as Rahul Gandhi took it upon themselves to explain the concept of costing, which includes manufacturing process on raw materials, in this case, potato. We strongly condemn such logical reasoning being offered to Rahul Gandhi. This is true. We too had a heated argument in the team as to who gets to write on Rahul Gandhi talking about potatoes and potato chips. Because in a boring world of grumpy politicians making sleep-inducing speeches, Rahul Gandhi’s stand up comedy, oops, speech are like fresh chips, no, rays of sunshine. This is not the first time Rahul Gandhi has invoked potato chips packets. Earlier in October in a rally in Chhattisgarh, Rahul Gandhi displayed his empathy with millions of chips-lovers worldwide whose faces turn sour looking at the few pieces of salty paradise at the bottom of a ridiculously oversized packet. Rahul Gandhi, after being prompted that a packet of potato chips costs Rs. 20, he explained how the potato farmers of Chhattisgarh would have wondered ‘our potato goes into it, and it is sold for Rs. 20!’ He had said that out of that 20 rupees, the farmers also get some share. “Aapko bhi lage ki haan main apna chips kha raha hoon aur chips ke packet mein se mujhe bhi thoda fayda hua,” Rahul Gandhi explained that when the farmers would get a share from sales of chips made by the potatoes they grew, they would feel good. He said that farmer loan waiver would be just the beginning, the potato farmers will also get their share from the sales of potato chips packets. How thoughtful, because those of you Modi-bhakts who have already started thinking that farmers do not usually buy potato chips, let us be clear. When Rahul baba becomes PM, people of India will get packets full of chips absolutely free under Alu Sona Yojna, the default Gandhi name at the beginning of the scheme will be decided later. The reasoning provided by Rahul Gandhi is so astounding that I am not even trying to figure out whether he meant potato is Rs. 5 per kg? Because if it is, I want to sue my vegetable vendor who sells it to me for Rs. 30 per kg. Or did he mean that 5 rupees a Kg is the price of one potato, half of which goes into the nitrogen gas-filled potato chips packet? And what happens to the other half of the potato? Does it put itself into a machine so that it can convert itself into gold ? Modiji must answer. But after giving share from the sales price of potato chips to potato farmers in Chhattisgarh and now in Madhya Pradesh, I think mobile phone factories are now a passé.

Rev Colney was an executive member of the body and a full-time missionary. In the first list of candidates released by the BJP for Mizoram, out of total 13 candidates 2 are former pastors, Rev Colney being one of them. Another executive member of Mission for Christ is a candidate of the Mizo National Front (MNF). Rev Colney had accused the MFC of double standards and said, “this is surprising decision and reflects double standards as the MFC has not taken any decision against the MNF candidate R Lalthangliana, who is also an executive member of MFC”. Rev Colney who is contesting from the Azwal East I assembly segment expressing his seriousness for the election said, “I am very much serious about the election. This expulsion seems only a part of the politics. I  am confident of winning and we, the BJP will do extremely well in the Nov 28 polls”. The other BJP candidate Rev Lalruata is a member of the United Pentecostal Mission, and he has the support of his colleagues. He is contesting from the Lunglei east seat against sitting Congress legislator Lalhimpuia and the MNF nominee Lawmawma Tochhawng. Responding to the expulsion of Rev Colney he said, “I am unfazed by what happened with our friend Rev Colney. In my case, there is no problem”. Rev Colney who feels that BJP coming into political reckoning in predominantly Christian stronghold Mizoram would be like  ‘heavenly blessings’ for the development of the northeastern state, said that he does not mind the action against him and asserted that his decision to serve the people will continue. “I am the founder member of Restoration India Mission (RIM) and we are working in various parts of India including Odisha, West Bengal and parts of Chhattisgarh”, he added. Rev Colney feels that it would be erroneous to describe BJP as anti-Christian. He pointed out that anti-conversion laws were passed in a number of States when Congress was in power at the Centre. Meanwhile, the Mission for Christ trying to defend their action of expulsing Rev Colney but taking no action against the MNF candidate R Lalthangliana, in its statement said,”We were shocked by the fact that our executive member and a missionary Rev Dr L R Colney was one of the selected candidates of the BJP”. MFC president Rev Lalchungnunga explained, “there is no politics. Colney is like my son but our supporters have not understood him. Moreover, he is a full-time missionary and cannot take part in politics”.

274,Abhishek Banerjee,"I sense some guilt and some shame on the part of Indian liberals. Which is a good beginning for them? Meanwhile, as Narendra Modi proves himself to be the bigger man, Indian liberals are looking like they are less than an inch tall. Why is the liberal ecosystem in such a foul mood over the inauguration of the Statue of Unity as a tribute to Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary? Take, for example, this tweet from an eminent historian: Or this, which made me burst out laughing. They actually found that four members of Patel’s family *contested* Lok Sabha elections! Oh no! Let me know how many of them went on to become Congress President, Prime Minister of India and self-crowned Bharat Ratnas riding purely on the strength of their last name. Why this sudden need among liberals to tear down Sardar Patel, one of the tallest leaders in the Congress pantheon? Are Congress sycophants worried that a 182-meter tall statue of Patel could damage the monotheistic cult of the Nehru-Gandhi clan that the Congress has transformed itself into? Even more pathetic are the repeated references to the fact that Sardar Patel played a key role in putting a ban on the RSS. Like this, for instance. What is the point that is being made here? The Sangh Parivar has never hidden its ideological differences and a long history of political disagreement with the Congress Party to which Sardar Patel belonged. And yet, Narendra Modi has not let political bitterness come in the way of recognizing Sardar Patel and his contributions to the nation. Ask the Americans. Does anyone care any more which political party Lincoln or Roosevelt belonged to? Why is the Indian liberal stuck in the swamp of pettiness, reminding the Sangh Parivar of unpleasantness between two rival political parties 70 years ago? Why are Indian liberals feeling so insecure? Or is it that the mere mention of the word “unity” is making liberals uncomfortable? Does it remind liberals of which family was the No. 1 beneficiary of the Partition of India? Today the liberal ecosystem speaks of dividing India with every breath they take. Some make it official with their “Bharat ke tukde” slogans. In Haryana, they are about inciting Jats. In Maharashtra, they are about inciting the Marathas against the Dalits and then the Dalits against the Marathas. A few months ago, the Congress Chief Minister of Karnataka referred to India’s Prime Minister as a “North Indian import.” In Sardar Patel’s Gujarat, the liberal today speaks the language of ethnic hatred against a poor labourer from Bihar or Uttar Pradesh. When at all the liberal mentions Sardar Patel, it is to incite members of Sardar’s own caste, the Patidars, against everyone else. Then the liberal goes to town distributing “I am Patidar” caps, encouraging young people to walk around with their caste written on their heads. To such people, the name “Statue of Unity” is likely to be anathema. Then, there are “arguments” against the statue that are such junk that it becomes harder to imagine good faith on part of the editor who allowed them to be published. Take this: The “argument”? That the Taj Mahal earns Rs 25 crore of tourist revenue per year. So how long would it take for a 3000 crore Statue of Unity to pay for itself? Seriously? Is that how you count the economic value created by the Taj Mahal?  You don’t just add the ticket sales for the monument; you count the entire impact of lakhs of tourists from India and abroad coming and spending in Agra each year. Are you saying that the world famous Taj Mahal brings only Rs 25 crore into the city’s economy every year? What about every travel company that runs tours to Agra, every hotel where the tourists stay and all the people who work for them? Would these have existed without the Taj Mahal? But such junk arguments are being allowed to enter the discourse and disseminated by so-called news websites. Speaking of expensive statues and whether they bring economic value, remember when Mayawati built statues of herself with public money all around Lucknow? Don’t forget that the Congress-led UPA was supported in Parliament by the Bahujan Samaj Party all through the ten years that Dr Singh was Prime Minister. Wonder what Rahul Gandhi thinks of that? Brace yourselves, folks. So if the Opposition gets its way in 2019 elections, it could very well be that the next Prime Minister of India will be unveiling statues of herself all over the country. The liberals would rather have that than Narendra Modi inaugurating a statue of Sardar Patel. I sense some guilt and some shame on the part of Indian liberals. Which is a good beginning for them?

275,OpIndia Staff,"Rahul Gandhi also acknowledged that his personal views on the matter are different from that of his party's Kerala unit. Congress president Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, said  that all women should be allowed inside the Sabarimala temple. Speaking in Madhya Pradesh, Gandhi acknowledged that his viewpoint differs from that of his party workers who represent the sentiment of the people of Kerala. He said , “My opinion is different from that of my party on this issue. My party represents the feelings of the people in Kerala. However, my personal viewpoint is that all men and women are equal. The women should be allowed into Sabarimala temple and they have the freedom to go everywhere”. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan welcomed  Gandhi’s statement and called the stand of the Kerala unit of Congress as unfortunate. “It is unfortunate that the Congress in Kerala does not have the same opinion as that of the party’s national leadership on the subject,” he said in a Facebook post. Gandhi’s statement comes  on the day when hundreds of BJP workers staged a “hunger strike”  in front of the state police chief’s office in Thiruvananthapuram protesting the LDF government’s decision to implement the Supreme Court order allowing the entry of women of all ages inside the Sabarimala temple. The BJP has also announced that it would be taking out a ‘Rath Yatra’ from Kasargod to Pathanamthitta, from November 8 to 13 to “save the customs and traditions” of the hill shrine. On Oct 27, the BJP president, Amit Shah in an address at Kannur, Kerala, had  come out strongly in support of Sabarimala devotees and criticised the Left government’s handling of the matter. He also condemned the arrest of devotees. Shah had assured that karyakartas of the BJP will be standing beside the devotees of Lord Ayyappa like a rock in the battle to defend the tradition of Sabarimala. The Kerala police had heaped atrocities on the protesting devotees arrested  around 2000 devotees and had registered 450 cases against them as on Oct 26. Many have tried their best to turn the Sabarimala flashpoint into a ‘women’s rights’ issue when it is actually about the right to pray and preserve traditions. They have misrepresented facts to insinuate that all women were disallowed whereas only women from the ages of 10 to 50 were not allowed to enter the temple. The devotees have been fighting for their right to preserve their tradition and have insisted that ways of Abrahamic religions where one rule prevails should not be imposed on a diverse religion like Hinduism where every temple and every deity has a different set of traditions, for example, there are some temples where men are also not allowed to enter.",2018-10-31,"Amit Shah,BJP,Congress president,Congress workers,Hindu Temples,Kerala Police,Pinarayi Vijayan,rahul gandhi,Sabarimala,SabarimalaVerdict,travancore devaswom board","Days after Amit Shah said he stands with Sabarimala devotees, Rahul Gandhi takes the opposite stand",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/days-after-amit-shah-said-he-stands-with-sabarimala-devotees-rahul-gandhi-takes-the-opposite-stand/

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) President Capt. N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Monday promised to bring ‘Jesus rule’ if the Congress were voted to power in the upcoming state assembly elections. Addressing a meeting of All India Christian Federation at YMCA, Secunderabad on Monday evening, Uttam Kumar Reddy said that ‘Jesus willed Governance’ will come in Telangana only if Congress is voted to power by defeating both TRS and the BJP. Reddy went on to claim  that caretaker Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of Telangana Rashtra Samiti and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held a secret meeting in Delhi ahead of Telangana state elections. “Voting for Mr Rao is nothing but voting for Modi. This is the reason why Mr Rao rushed to Delhi,” said Uttam Kumar Reddy. Mr Uttam Kumar Reddy said that the Congress will provide Scheduled Caste (SC) status to Dalit Christians and give importance to Christians, unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He also promised to give free education  to children of pastors, priests and Imams along with health and accidental insurance up to five lakhs. Reddy further added that if Congress is voted to power in Telangana, they will give an honorarium to pastors and priests along with free houses and provide free electricity to the places of worship. The Christian Corporation will be provided with funds to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees for their development, said Reddy. He also promised of hostels, skill development centres for Christian students, loans for self-employment scheme, 3,000 monthly unemployment allowance, land for new churches. Addition to this, Reddy promised the All India Christian Federation of a CBI investigation into alleged encroachment of properties belonging to churches and also a judicial commission to study socio-economic status of the Christians. A Christian Study Circle for students and subsidy for those going on pilgrimage to Jerusalem will be introduced after Congress coming to power in the state of Telangana, said Uttam Reddy. He said the next Congress government would strengthen the Christian Minorities Finance Corporation by giving adequate funds. Meanwhile, Telangana BJP on Tuesday urged the State Election Commission  to take action against TPCC chief Uttam Kumar Reddy for violating the Model code of conduct by using religious appeasement to garner votes in the upcoming elections. The BJP alleged that Congress was provoking the religious and regional sentiments by luring the Christian community. Capt.

However, in India, it has never been the case. Indian communists have always been prone to romanticizing Islam and Christianity and while denigrating Hinduism. Thus, it surprised no one when former Vice-President of JNU student’s union and Leftist activist Shehla Rashid tweeted in celebration of a musician’s conversion to Islam. People were quick to point out the hypocrisy of someone celebrating conversions to one’s faith while condemning ‘Gharwapsi’, an initiative to bring back converted people back to the Hindu fold. One such person was Pawan Khera, leader of the Congress party. However, ‘neutral’ journalists were quick to come to Shehla’s defence. Funnily enough, even ‘neutral fact-checkers’ could not see the hypocrisy of a communist celebrating religious conversions, especially those who condemn ‘Gharwapsi’.

281,Abhishek Banerjee,"We have a had a bad few hundred years, but we are still here today. And we can again be the nation that we were. It is time to rebuild. Time to rebuild the shining city on the hill. Here is a question. Can you tell me which year it was when the Ram Janmabhoomi / Babri Masjid case was first filed in court? You know it was a long time ago. But how long? Perhaps it was filed in the 1980s, when Rajiv was PM? Back when we were all using black and white TVs? No. Then, perhaps it was filed when Indira was Prime Minister? Or perhaps in times of Nehru? Wrong again. It’s much older than that! The filing of the suit predates the Second World War. It predates Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. It predates the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre, the First World War and even the birth of Gandhi. It predates the discovery of the polio vaccine, the discovery of penicillin, the first automobile and first ever powered flight by the Wright brothers. Would you believe that the case was filed  in 1855-56? That is even before the First War of Indian independence in 1857! They say justice delayed is justice denied. One hundred and sixty-three years later, I wouldn’t say that justice is being “denied.” I would just say that we need a new word for what is happening. It is time for India as a whole to stop kicking the can down the road. Thus far and no further. After independence, India did not really take off the way we would have liked. By opting for a (near) Communist destiny, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty put India on the wrong side of history. The devastated continent of Europe put itself back together. Japan and Germany rose from the ashes of World War 2.  The countries of the Middle East transformed their landscapes with gleaming skyscrapers. The countries of South East Asia rose up as “Asian tigers.” And, of course, China took off. India remained, for the most part, a spectator. Poverty and corruption became endemic and then synonymous with India. The hopes and dreams of the nation remained in chains. The turnaround began in 1991 after Nehruvian secularism imploded spectacularly, coinciding with the collapse of global communism. Since that lowest ebb in 1991, India has been surging, aiming for its rightful status as a global superpower. But we know that India is more than just another country. India is an ancient nation, an inheritor of one of the world’s most influential civilizations. What was the ultimate goal of Alexander the Great when he set out of Macedon? He was looking for India. Eighteen Hundred years later, what did Christopher Columbus set out to do when he bumped into America? He was looking for India. That is who we are. We are India. The Americans like to say that the USA is the “shining city on the hill.” They are wrong. We are India.  This is not an empty, sentimental boast. This is a fact. And what do we mean by a resurgent India? It means that we recover the position that we had in the world. And today we have the confidence to do it. Who are we? What is our brand value? Our brand is that we are the sole inheritors of the ancient Hindu civilization. The mentality of the “second-class citizen” has been hammered into us by centuries of conquest and colonialism. But Hinduness will always be our distinguishing identity, even for those whose ancestors were converted by the same forces of conquest and colonialism. A Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is a symbol of rebuilding India. It is the overwhelming will of the people. And even those who are likely to be against the Ram Mandir know that very well in their hearts. Why do you suppose certain lawyers have been begging the Supreme Court to keep deferring the hearing and the verdict? One hundred and sixty-three years and they still want more delay. Why? Because they are scared. They know that once the Ram Mandir becomes a talking point, their political masters will be crushed at the polls by the overwhelming will of the nation. Because they know that every Hindu carries within their heart a bit of the sacred memory of who we were. They are scared of that little flame and what it can do. Seventy years ago, in the euphoric first days of independence, Indians wanted to rebuild the Somnath Temple. At that time as well, there was one particular political master, a darling of the British, who resisted. Because he was steeped in the colonial superstition of the Indian Hindu being destined to lose every single time. But Indians decided to rebuild Somnath anyway. If that all-powerful master back then could not stop the will of the Indian Hindu, do we really need to worry about what his minions want today? No way. Any other way to achieve the Ram Mandir will not do justice to the fact that the temple must be a symbol of resurgent Hindu civilization. The will of the people has to be expressed by the House of the People. We have a had a bad few hundred years, but we are still here today. And we can again be the nation that we were.

While all political parties rustle up for the upcoming Telangana assembly election, scheduled to be held on December 7, this video which has briskly gone viral might leave the Congress in an embarrassing position. The incident reportedly took place at Sankapur village in Alampur constituency in Jogulamba Gadwal district. The man caught in the video, identified as Congress party Mandal president Doddappa, tries to assure the locals that he is a known face in the village. He is heard saying, “People who vote for Congress will vote for us and people who vote for TRS will vote for them but now you have been promised Rs 5 lakh. We will arrange for it and definitely ensure that you get the money.” Doddappa also asks the locals to convince at least 100 people to sign an undertaking that they will vote for the Congress and said that the promised amount would be deposited in the village temple’s account. “If you convince the entire village to vote for Congress, ensuring Rs 5 lakh will be my responsibility. I’m giving you my word. There is no need to ask Sampath. As a Mandal president, I know everyone by name and face,” he adds. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), taking offence, filed a formal complaint against Sampath Kumar with the Election Commission. The TRS MLC Srinivas Reddy alleged that Sampath Kumar, the former Congress MLA, was present at the event and said that it was a serious violation of the Code of Conduct. Accusing the Congress of resorting to such dirty strategies to procure votes, he also demanded strong action against the former Congress MLA. The Election commission taking note of this incident has sought a report from the concerned District Electoral Officer after which necessary actions would be taken from their side. The Parliament in July had passed  the ‘anti-corruption bill’ whereby the bribe givers along with the takers would be penalised. In May, as all the parties were gearing for the Karnataka elections, in its exclusive expose Republic TV had revealed  how a certain ‘national party’ was engaging in ‘need-based social profiling’, which essentially translates to customizing bribes for voters to buy off votes.

283,Ananth Krishna,"The Communist party and the left establishment in the state have more than unnerved by the display of strength that was seen in Namajapa yatras across the state.  The Malayali Hindu is quite an abused lot, but they have only realized it rather late. With the controversy surrounding the implementation of the Judgement of the Supreme Court on Sabarimala, the Hindu community of Kerala has finally stood up, and said: “Enough is enough”. A line has been drawn across the sand by Malayali Hindus – regardless of caste, class and social status. Sabarimala is the veritable rock that has broke the camel’s back (as opposed to the straw). A rage has swept over us, one that has been brewing for a long time. A pent-up anger has been released, and the results have been ugly. The person responsible for this aggravated situation is none other than the Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinrayi Vijayan. The Supreme Court might have given the Judgement allowing the entry of young women into the temple, but Vijayan attempted to no form of reconciliation towards the Hindus of the state who were obviously perturbed by the transgression of the highest court. He aggravated the anger of Hindus by adopting a hardline position on the issue and fuming in speeches and press conferences about the ‘Sangh Parivar conspiracy’ to destroy the ‘secular’ credentials of the state by hoisting the Sabarimala issue. He also made nonsensical comments – he asked why the BJP did not approach the court regarding this issue. The finer points of  The same can be inferred from the fact that more than 2000 persons have been arrested in connection with the protests that happened in the state during October 16 – October 22! The state government has engaged in a crackdown of massive proportions. Kerala Police has been given a free hand to regulate the flow of devotees into the temple; every single power that has can be used by the state has been called on to ‘manage’ the ‘public order’ in the area where the temple is situated. The Communist party and the left establishment in the state have more than unnerved by the display of strength that was seen in Namajapa yatras across the state. Hundreds of thousands of protestors, from Kasorgode to Thiruvananthapuram, from the Hills of Wayanad to the backwaters of Alappuzha protested the Judgement of the Supreme Court and the stand of the Kerala Government. Many of these protests were organic, organised by Ayyappa Sanghams or collectives of Hindus aggrieved at the Judgement. These protests were led by women devotees, who did not wish that the The response of the Communist party has been to decry those protest as being limited to “Upper caste” community. The obvious aim of the CPM here was to create caste divisions within the Hindu community regarding Sabarimala. Then, they attempted to portray this issue as the communalization of the state. These attempts are indications that the left is using every single weapon in their arsenal to tarnish the image of pious devotees who oppose the Judgement and its implementation. The amount of misinformation and propaganda that has dominated the mainstream television channels and newspapers are undoubtedly the work of the left’s “fellow travellers”. Those who have studied Communism and its methods would not be shocked at the methods that they have adopted in Kerala. They have framed the issue like that of “Social Justice”, attempting to fashion the Sabarimala Judgement as one of those great steps towards ‘equality’. References are aplenty from Marxists in the state to the achievements of the state in Social reform, recalling the Vaikom and Guruvayur Satyagraha that secured the right of temple entry for lower castes. Those attempts have however fallen flat because the devotees of the Ayyappa and the larger public (one might ask if there is a difference between the two at this stage) understand the rituals and traditions of the temple and how distinct they are from the question of temple entry for lower castes. The Sabarimala temple has a deep and pervasive belief among the Hindus of the state, especially among the lower castes. Almost every Malayali knows the rites and vows that a  The Communist Party has been in many a sense, representing the interests of the Hindu Community state. Primarily because their opposition, the Kerala Congress (Mani) and the Indian Union Muslim League, the constituents of the United Democratic Front represent the interests of the Christian and Muslim Communities in the state. The party has encouraged and supported ritual artforms of the Hindus of the state in more than one occasion. It has overtly and covertly signalled to Hindu Conservatives in the state before. Even while the Chief Minister has criticized and slammed the BJP, that Tantri and others, he has maintained a steady silence on the role of the Nair Service Society. The NSS is the organization that has represented for long the interests of the Upper caste Nair community in the state. The NSS and its general secretary, Sukumaran Nair has taken a strong stand on the issue, having joined as intervenors when the PIL was filed and organized multiple protests against the state government and the Supreme Court Judgement. However, Pinrayi is yet to directly criticize them. The hardcore communists of the state are perplexed about how to deal with the popular resistance towards the stand of their almighty leader, Pinrayi. The image that he had created among the electorate due to his fearless leadership during the worst floods in the century  That is all but destroyed now. His obstinacy is without doubt leading the party to a crisis like the West Bengal unit had during the Singur controversy. I was myself, a former supporter and well wisher of the Communist Party and its grand objectives of ‘social reforms’ and ‘economic progress for all’. The duplicity of such claims and the perversity of their proclaimed objectives unravelled before me as I grew older. The true moment of reckoning for me was the JNU incident. For many millions of Malayalis, it has been what has happened in the last few weeks. The Sabarimala incident has the potential to be cataclysmic to the CPM. Before this, it seemed to be almost certain that the left would have a stranglehold on power due to the decline of the Indian National Congress and the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Those dynamics have been altered radically. What lies ahead for the state in coming days(and indeed Months and years) is uncertain, especially since Amit Shah has vowed that BJP will stand as a ‘rock’ for Ayyappa devotees and Sabarimala. The events of the coming days will determine the future of Kerala, and its Hindu Community. As a devotee, I pray that the rites and rituals of the temple not be violated in these weeks.

286,Jinit Jain,"Speaking with the media, the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board Waseem Rizvi accused Congress and other Muslim fanatics for politicising the issue.  The Central Shia Waqf board in Uttar Pradesh has blamed  Congress party and Muslim radicals’ dilatory tactics responsible for the delay in the verdict on a Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Speaking with the media, the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board Waseem Rizvi accused Congress and other Muslim fanatics for politicising the issue. ”Due to some radical Muslims and politics of the Congress party, the issue of construction of the Ram Temple is stuck in courts,” he said. Concurring with the 2010 Allahabad High Court verdict, in which the court apportioned the disputed land equally among the three principle litigants- the Shia Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla, the Shia board has often taken a stand at odds with the majority Muslim view. Last year, the board expressed its approval of a grand Ram Temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. On Monday, Rizvi reiterated a somewhat similar sentiment. Rizvi asserted  that the God who decides the fate of mankind in the whole world is today waiting for a human court to decide on his own abode. “This is a matter of shame for all human being all across the world,” he said. Hearing on the much-vexed issue of Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid, the Supreme Court said  on Monday that it would fix in January 2019 the date on which final hearing of the dispute would commence. The constitution of the three-judge bench that will hear the case will also be decided in January. This pushes back the chances of a verdict before the 2019 general elections causing a chorus  of an ordinance to grow.",2018-10-29,"Ayodhya,Ayodhya dispute,Congress,rahul gandhi,Ram Janmabhoomi,shia waqf board,sonia gandhi,supreme court",Shia Waqf Board blames Congress and Muslim radicals for delaying Ram Temple case,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/shia-waqf-board-blames-congress-and-muslim-radicals-for-delaying-ram-temple-case/

He added that together with the Indian leader, he would like to strengthen bilateral cooperation to realise a free and open Indo-Pacific. Shinzo in his message  to the country said India is driving the region and the world’s prosperity as a global power. “Prime Minister Modi is an outstanding leader of his great country,” he said. Emphasising the need to cooperate and expand broadly in many fields such as security, investment, information technology, agriculture, health, environment and tourism, he added, “I have always believed and stated that the relationship between Japan and India is blessed with the largest potential in the world.” “We share a big win-win potential in all areas and Japan remains committed to supporting India’s economic growth and Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India initiative through high-speed rail, subways and other infrastructure, mobilising Japan’s world-leading technologies. The day when Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains start running between Mumbai and Ahmedabad through cooperation will mark a shining symbol of Japan-India friendship  in the future, he said. It is worthy to note here how the Congress IT cell had persistently tried to lie  about the bullet train MoU signed by our Prime Minister and the lie was further patronized by the Congress mouthpiece National Herald, reporting  that Japan has stopped providing funds for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. This lie, however, died its natural death after India and later the Japanese ambassador rubbished the claim. Before leaving for the trip, Modi described India and Japan as a “winning combination”.

After his recent tirade of claiming  that no good Hindu would want to see a Ram temple at the Babri site, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has yet again issued a controversial statement saying comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a ‘Scorpion on a Shivling’ and claimed that PM Modi cannot be even hit with a chappal. According to the reports, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, while speaking  at the Bangalore Lit Fest on his book ‘The Paradoxical Prime Minister” on Sunday, he went on to claim that some unnamed RSS leader had expressed to a journalist that Prime Minister is like a ‘Scorpion on a Shivling’ and you can neither remove him with your hand nor hit him with the chappal (footwear). This derogatory statement by the Congress leader has now created a new controversy. Shashi Tharoor slanderous statements targeting the Prime Minister comes after his recent failed attempt to insinuate  and humiliate Hindus after he had claimed that no good Hindu would want to see a Ram temple built by demolishing somebody else’s place of worship.

Days after Congress’ morbid hatred  where Congress spokesperson asked BJP to either ‘show Parrikar in person or conduct Shradhh (death ceremony)’, Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane has disclosed  that Parrikar has been suffering from pancreatic cancer. The statement by the health minister came amid persistent demands from the opposition parties to know whether the Chief Minister was fit enough to govern. The state government had hitherto been eluding relentless queries on Parrikar’s ailment. Congress spokesperson on Friday had given a four-day ultimatum to the Goa state government to prove that Parrikar was of “sound health and mind” and in a position to govern the state. Responding to the warning , Rene told the media here, “He is the CM of Goa and the fact is that he is not well. He has got pancreatic cancer. There is no hiding of this fact.” He furthered, “Let him be peaceful with his family.

290,Abhishek Banerjee,"CPIM listened to the left loving media. And waited for the day their anti-Hindu activists would become Kerala’s biggest heroes by doing to Sabarimala what Ghazni did to Somnath.
 There is a well-known expression “follow the money”. With political parties, it is just like that: “follow the votes”. This is not even meant to be criticism, not even a taunt. It’s the simple economics of votes. Market demand leads to supply. And the BJP has now officially thrown its weight behind those protesting the state takeover of Sabarimala Temple, with the confirmation coming from the highest level. At first, Smriti Irani did some kite flying, testing waters with a poorly worded offhand remark that gave more grist to the liberal lie machine. There is no doubt that her remarks were twisted, but by this point in politics, she should have expected that in advance. Let me say something here about the whole matter of whether the celebrated anti-Hindu activist shown on all TV channels was actually carrying used sanitary napkins to desecrate the Sabarimala Temple. I don’t care whether it’s true or not. This “news” has been viral on social media and that makes it “true” for me at a political level. Dear liberals, think of it as Lord Ayyappa’s punishment for the time you spread lies about “semen filled balloons” on Holi. In order to demonize the festival of Holi, prominent liberals were asking random Hindu men on Twitter why they throw “semen filled balloons” … remember? Don’t complain now. Go explain to lakhs of devotees why your beloved anti-Hindu activist was carrying “used napkins” to desecrate the temple. Not my problem, but yours. I know that there is a lot of disillusionment (and anger) among online right-wing over the BJP dragging its feet before finally getting its act together on the issue of Sabarimala Temple. However you feel about the leadership, we have to be grateful to the selfless RSS and BJP worker who has been on the front lines of opposing the storming of the temple from the very beginning. Who would understand this better than RSS/BJP workers? Suffice to say that the CPIM government in Kerala has been left totally blindsided by the Hindu uprising in the state. This was much more than political upheaval. It was a grassroots uprising. The images reminded me of Jammu 2008 when common Hindus took to the street against the Jammu and Kashmir government revoking the land transfer to Amarnath Shrine Board to build temporary settlements for pilgrims. The reason the CPIM govt was caught blindsided is because they committed the cardinal sin in politics : buying their own propaganda. Especially since 2014, the mainstream media and social media arms of the liberal ecosystem have sought to project Kerala as some kind of anti-Hindu state. This propaganda peaked in August when it was made to look as if even floods in Kerala are vaguely the fault of Hindutva forces. We have become used to contempt filled lectures about how Kerala is “different” and how Hindutva forces can never secure a foothold in Kerala. This, of course, couldn’t be less true. The BJP’s vote share in last Kerala elections was 16%. Do you know that JDU’s vote share in last Bihar elections was 16%? The BJP is already as popular in Kerala as Nitish is popular in Bihar. Think about that for a second! The CPIM foolishly bought into their own rhetoric. Here’s what they forgot: And Kerala Hindus don’t hate Hindus. You know why? Because they are Hindus themselves! I know every Communist will be shocked to hear this. So Comrade Pinarayi Vijayan’s government sat cosily in Thiruvananthapuram, convinced that Kerala Hindus were salivating for an opportunity to desecrate Sabarimala Temple. How could that not be? All the prominent media persons, who were themselves SFI and AISA comrades back when they were wasting their time learning English Literature and/or Africology in college, said that Kerala Hindus would love to see their temples being stormed by the state. So CPIM listened to the left loving media. And waited for the day their anti-Hindu activists would become Kerala’s biggest heroes by doing to Sabarimala what Ghazni did to Somnath. Ha! How wrong they were! My favourite thing about the entire Sabarimala episode is how tribal Hindus, following their ancient duty, threw a protective ring around the temple. As on date, tribals represent the worst failure of the whole “idea of India” project. From Jharkhand to Chhattisgarh to Odisha to Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bengal, Gujarat and Kerala and all the way to the North East, tribals are the most consciously Hindu community in India today.  Take that JNU! When the CPIM was caught unawares, it acted with the reflexive brutality common to Communist regimes around the world. The Communist police having failed to storm Sabarimala Temple, is now on the hunt for dissenters. So far 2000 have been rounded up and arrested. Two thousand dissenters arrested in Kerala! Imagine how big this story would have been if 99% of our media persons had not been from college comrades from SFI and AISA. Sadly for the CPIM, this is not Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia does not even exist anywhere in the world any more. The CPIM can put up as many portraits of Stalin and Kim Jong Un as it wants but the next election in Kerala will still happen on schedule. We are witnessing the last rites of Communism in India.

The usually tight-lipped Prashant Kishor who is a former poll strategist and has recently joined Janata Dal United gave an interview recently to Republic TV . In the said interview, for the first time ever, Prashant Kishor opened up about campaigning for the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections and for the Nitish-Lalu ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in the 2015 Bihar elections. He also answered a host of questions about his election strategy for the Congress party and Captain Amarinder Singh in the 2017 Punjab elections. It has long been alleged that BJP had dumped Prashant Kishor after the resounding 2014 victory. Kishor denied these allegations and blamed his impatience for dissociating from the party. He attributed his exit from the party to BJP delaying the implementation of the lateral entry scheme where young professionals like him were to join the party. While Kishor credits Modi for the huge victory in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he surprisingly blames himself for the disgraceful defeat of the Congress party in 2017 UP Assembly elections. According to Kishor, Congress failed to implement the 14 modules of the campaign which were designed by him. He said that out of the 14 modules designed, Congress implemented only a few. Interestingly, he said that Congress dropped the idea of contesting on its own and decided to form an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) only after the surgical strike that was conducted by the Indian Army. This surgical strike was in fact widely criticised by the Congress party and several functionaries of the party had even asked the BJP and the Indian Army to provide proof that such a strike had taken place. Kishore also hinted at Rahul Gandhi being one of the reasons for Congress’ resounding loss. He asserted that had Priyanka Gandhi Vadra been allowed to be the face of the campaign in the 2017 UP Assembly elections, Congress would definitely have won more seats. He further revealed that projecting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the campaign was discussed at the highest level but it was not approved by the top leadership of the Congress. When asked whether he would support Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections he said that he does not want to continue as a freelance strategist but he can support him as a JDU leader. When questioned about the probability of Modi becoming the Prime Minister for another term after the coming Lok Sabha elections, he replied that if elections were to held today, Modi is in a better position to win. He also said that 100 seats for Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections is a ‘big ask’.",2018-10-28,"2019 general elections,2019 lok sabha elections,BJP,Congress,JDU,Narendra Modi,Nitish Kumar,prashant kishore","Modi could be the PM after 2019 elections: Prashant Kishor, former poll strategist and JDU leader",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/modi-could-be-the-pm-after-2019-elections-prashant-kishor-former-poll-strategist-and-jdu-leader/
296,K Bhattacharjee,"Although people may disagree with Houellebecq on a variety of issues, the criticisms of secular atheistic materialism he has raised through his works are pertinent enough to raise serious concerns about the dominant social dogma among the intellectual elite all over the West. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled  that insulting Prophet Muhammad is not free speech. An Austrian women criminal conviction by an Austrian court was upheld by the ECHR on the grounds that her comments on the Prophet “goes beyond the permissible limits of an objective debate” and “could stir up prejudice and put at risk religious peace.” For certain intellectuals, the move will come across as merely the latest step in secular Europe’s eventual inevitable fall to Radical Islam. A prominent intellectual who has written extensively on the spiritual decline of Europe that has felicitated such a collapse is Michel Houellebecq. Houellebecq is a controversial French author, often dubbed an Islamophobe, who has critiqued modern European culture and argued that the current liberal European lifestyle is unsustainable. Houellebecq’s book ‘Submission’ created quite the storm when it was first released. The book, set in 2022, describes the narrator’s personal journey in a politically charged France on the backdrop of national elections where the far right French nationalists and radical Islamic groups are involved in a series of violent clashes with each other and the very real possibility of the entire country descending very quickly into chaos and complete anarchy. The lead in the book, Francois, is a melancholic middle-aged professor who does not quite really gel well with the time he has been born into. He leads a meaningless life, without a wife or a family, who just passes from one temporary sexual relationship to another without ever forming an emotional bond with his partner. The meaning of the title of the book becomes abundantly clear in one of the quotes by a character in the novel, “It’s submission. The shocking and simple idea, which had never been so forcefully expressed, that the summit of human happiness resides in the most absolute submission.” The novel, thus, mulls the idea that submission could be the path forward for a truly happy European society. It is quite clear from Houellebecq’s ‘Submission’ that he does not believe an Islamic takeover of liberal Europe will necessarily be a bad thing for the future of its people. It appears that he believes Islam can discipline the liberal westerners and assist them in leading a more meaningful life, something that Christianity can no longer felicitate. At the end of the novel, Islam eventually takes over France, the order is restored, women are veiled, polygamy is legalized and the high unemployment rate is resolved after women are removed from the workplace and sent into the homes. The novel ends with the narrator, who was conflicted about converting to Islam, poised to convert with the prospect of a better life, a prestigious job and wives chosen for him. From his personal history, however, it appears that Islam is not Houellebecq’s preferred solution to what he regards as the core threat towards the European people, their secular atheist materialistic culture. He admitted during an interview  with The Guardian that he was “probably” Islamophobic. Despite allegations that his novel, Submission, was Islamophobic, he strongly maintains that it was not. “Everything returns to order … the moderate faction manages to control its extremists, which is far from a given at the moment.” Houellebecq has been very sharp in his critique of liberal sexual mores. In his book, ‘Whatever’, he writes, “It’s a fact…that in societies like ours sex truly represents a second system of differentiation, completely independent of money; and as a system of differentiation, it functions just as mercilessly. The effects of these two systems are, furthermore, strictly equivalent. Just like unrestrained economic liberalism, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization. Some men make love every day; others five or six times in their life, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. It’s what’s known as ‘the law of the market’…Economic liberalism is an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society. Sexual liberalism is likewise an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society.” Again, in Submission, Houellebecq reveals his disdain for liberal sexual mores through the narrator, “Hidden all day in impenetrable black burkas, rich Saudi women transformed themselves by night into birds of paradise with their corsets, their see-through bras, their G-strings with multicoloured lace and rhinestones. They were exactly the opposite of Western women, who spent their days dressed up and looking sexy to maintain their social status, then collapsed in exhaustion once they got home, abandoning all hope of seduction in favour of clothes that were loose and shapeless.” According to Houellebecq, Catholics are not regarded by Muslims as their real enemy. He writes, “For these Muslims, the real enemy—the thing they fear and hate—isn’t Catholicism. It’s secularism. It’s laicism. It’s atheist materialism. They think of Catholics as fellow believers. Catholicism is a religion of the Book. Catholics are one step away from converting to Islam—that’s the true, original Muslim vision of Christianity.” The author appears to endorse the idea that secularism is doomed to failure from the very onset. He writes in ‘Submission’,  “they argue that belief in a transcendent being conveys a genetic advantage: that couples who follow one of the three religions of the Book and maintain patriarchal values have more children than atheists or agnostics. You see less education among women, less hedonism and individualism. And to a large degree, this belief in transcendence can be passed on genetically. Conversions, or cases where people grow up to reject family values, are statistically insignificant. In the vast majority of cases, people stick with whatever metaphysical system they grow up in. That’s why atheist humanism—the basis of any ‘pluralist society’—is doomed.” Houellebecq’s reasoning does appear to be grounded on solid facts. Eric Kaufmann, professor of politics at Birkbeck college, University of London, and a specialist in demography in his book ‘Shall the Religious inherit the Earth?’ asserts that it is very much the case. And even he doesn’t believe that is necessarily a bad thing. “As a utilitarian”, Kaufmann writes , “I believe that the maximisation of collective happiness is the proper end of humanity; and on that score, religion seems more rational than irreligion.” And the reason given is very simple, religious people have more children than their secular counterparts. It is argued that unlike materialists, who often turn out to be hedonists, religious people are prepared to make sacrifices to promote and sustain their values. Houellebecq’s criticism of liberal sexual mores is not without merit as well. Sexual liberalism has created a class of men who cannot find sexual partners in an era where monogamy is increasingly on the decline. There have been occasions  when mass murders have been committed by men who were sexually frustrated and vehemently angry with the fact that they could not find sexual partners. Jordan Peterson, the clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto, also sympathizes with the notion that the sexual revolution has created classes of losers and winners in the sexual marketplace. A study  on Tinder, the hookup app, revealed that the bottom 80% of men are competing for the bottom 22% of women while the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men in terms of attractiveness. Thus, it appears clear that in an extremely sexually liberal community, a significant portion of men will find themselves unable to satisfy their sexual urges. It can have devastating consequences as a high proportion of sexually frustrated men is deeply problematic for any society. Peterson speculates that “enforced monogamy” may be the only way to solve this problem. Liberal sexual mores are also associated with low birthrates while sexually conservative societies tend to have more children. Thus, coming back to the demography argument, liberal sexual mores do appear to be unsustainable in the long term. Houellebecq isn’t the only author who has focused his attention on these issues. Cultural commentator Mark Steyn wrote in his bestselling book, America Alone, “The continent has embraced a spiritual death long before the demographic one. In those seventeen European countries that have fallen into the “lowest-low fertility,” where are the children? In a way, you’re looking at them: the guy sipping espresso at a sidewalk cafe listening to his iPod, the eternal adolescent charges of the paternalistic state. The government makes the grown-up decisions and we spend our pocket money on our record collection…the long-term cost of welfare is the infantilization of the population.” It is important to note that European governments may well have been forced to open the doors for migrants from regions of the world with evidently higher birth rates precisely due to falling birth rates combined with the behemoth welfare state apparatus. To maintain a massive welfare state, you need taxpayers who are going to pay for it. And in the absence of taxpayers, you have little choice but to import them from other nations. As Steyn says, Europe’s “lavish welfare states are unsustainable with their post-Christian birth rates.” A regular feature in all of Houellebecq’s books is a narrator who is non-religious and has an extremely pessimistic view of the world. The narrator often suffers from depression and an aching loneliness. In Submission, the author finds some solace as he looks poised to convert to Islam. Such a description may not be too out of sync with reality. Official ‘well-being statistics’ do show that religious people of all hues are happier  than their atheistic counterparts. Also, as a matter of fact, studies show that religious societies are more tightly knit, more cohesive, more bound together, all of which are indicators for greater happiness. Whether a society based on Islamic values will be better for Europeans than the current society based on secular atheistic materialism only time will tell. But it cannot be ignored that Europe currently is in a state of crisis felicitated precisely by progressive values. And although people may disagree with Houellebecq on a variety of issues, the criticisms of secular atheistic materialism he has raised through his works are pertinent enough to raise serious concerns about the dominant social dogma among the intellectual elite all over the West.",2018-10-29,"Atheism,book,Book Review,christianity,europe,France,Fundamentalism,islam,Islamophobia,radical islam,Secularism",Michel Houellebecq: The perils of secular atheistic materialism through the eyes of a French ‘Islamophobic’ intellectual,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/michel-houellebecq-the-perils-of-secular-atheistic-materialism-through-the-eyes-of-a-french-islamophobic-intellectual/

According to Kerala DGP Loknath Behera, many more people “stoking unrest” have been identified and if need be, more arrests will happen. He said they have constituted the police committee for seeking suggestions on ways to provide protection to women. The protests in Sabarimala followed soon after the Supreme Court verdict of allowing women to enter the temple. Protestors prevented the entry of women of menstruating age into the shrine after it was opened – on October 17 – to the public for the first time since the court’s order. The shrine closed on October 22 after the monthly rituals were completed, but not a single woman between the ages of 10 and 50 was able to enter it, owing to the selfless and undeterred protests held by the devotees of Lord Ayyappa. Pinning the blame squarely on the Sangh and the BJP, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said  that the Sangh and its associated parties have turned the Sabarimala temple into a conflict zone and are instigating the devotees to undermine the Supreme Court verdict. He also said that the Kerala government is committed to implementing the Supreme Court order. Interestingly, reports also emerged that several communists were quitting the CPM ranks owing to the communist government’s excesses on devotees. The communist party is facing the ire  of the devotees of Lord Ayappa for mishandling the protestors.

Earlier this week, the police had earlier arrested  1,400 people in connection with the protests.

299,K Bhattacharjee,"The Chakma-Mizo conflict is not a recent phenomenon. In 1972, the Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) was created under the sixth schedule of the Indian Constitution which created simmering resentment among the Mizo community. The Congress party has fielded  two Chakma candidates in Mizoram for the upcoming Assembly elections going against a directive by NGOs demanding that political parties not field Chakma candidates. Opposition parties Mizoram National Front and the BJP are expected to field Chakma candidates as well. An umbrella body of civil society organizations, the NGO Coordination Committee of Mizos, including the Young Mizo Association (YMA), Mizoram Upa Pawl (MUP) or Mizoram Elders’ Association, Mizo Hmeichhia Insuihkhawm Pawl (MHIP) or Mizo Women Federation, Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) and Mizo Students’ Union (MSU) had issued  the diktat citing that “Chakmas are Bangladeshi foreigners” and therefore, have no right to contest elections. The Chakma-Mizo conflict is not a recent phenomenon. In 1972, the Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) was created under the sixth schedule of the Indian Constitution which created simmering resentment among the Mizo community. After the signing of the Mizoram accord of 1986, leader of the Mizo National Front (MNF), Laldenga, had demanded that the CADC be dissolved but his demand was rejected. Then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had even said during a rally in Aizawl, “if the Mizos expect justice from India as a small minority, they must safeguard the interest of their own minorities like the Chakmas”. The core aspect of the inter-tribal conflict is the issue of the nativity. The Mizos claim that only their community is indigenous to the state of Mizoram which is contested by the Chakmas by their own version of the matter. The matter is further escalated by the fact that there are certain regions in adjoining areas of Bangladesh that the Chakmas have been inhabiting for long. The Mizos allege that the Chakmas are infiltrating the country through illegal immigration. The issue of nativity has direct consequences for the inhabitants of the state. For instance, last year in 2017, four students were denied  seats after intervention by the state government despite being selected to pursue bachelors’ degrees in medicine and surgery in Indian colleges due to the fact that they were Chakmas. The intervention came after the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (Mizo Students’ Association, or MZP) threatened to launch a statewide indefinite bandh if medical seats were allotted to anyone but Mizo students. Buddha Dhan Chakma, the only Chakma minister in the state cabinet, had submitted his resignation  citing discrimination towards members from his community. In 2016, a primary school was torched  and a house was vandalised at Tuichawng Chhuah village in Mizoram’s Lunglei district, a village that is dominated by Chakmas. The Chakmas had alleged that they were being harassed and attempts were being made to evict them since the month of November, the previous year. During the 1990s, it is reported  that the names of hundreds and thousands of Chakmas were removed from the electoral list on the basis of complaints filed by a few individuals. The same civil society organizations are said to be responsible for the removal of Chakmas from the electoral list. In 1992, 380 Chakma houses were burnt  by organized mobs. Organizations have frequently demanded  the expulsion of Chakmas who entered Mizoram after 1950. Earlier in October as well, the YMA demanded  that the CDAC be scrapped claiming it is a safe haven for Bangladeshi infiltrators. Victims of Mizo aggression aren’t Chakmas alone. Over 30,000 Bru tribals were forced  to flee the state in 1997 as a consequence of ethnic clashes following the murder of a forest official by Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF). The BNLF was demanding an autonomous council for Bru tribals after Mizo organizations demanded that Brus be removed from electoral rolls claiming that they were not indigenous to the state. Repatriation of the Brus began  only in July this year and thus far, only a couple of dozen families or so have returned to Mizoram.",2018-10-27,"2018 Assembly Elections,BJP,communal violence,Congress,Mizoram,mizoram assembly elections,NGOs,Politics,Refugees,Tribal groups",Mizoram: NGOs oppose political parties fielding Chakma candidates.

As per Aminul, there’s no harm if a student goes to college wearing the hijab or niqab. He said , “No such decision was taken in the 60 years of the college’s existence. I would like to know where in the Constitution or the state gazette notification it is written that one cannot wear such outfits.” Aminul is an alumnus of the institution, Anandaram Dhekial Phookan (ADP) college, himself. “The college has been imparting education to students irrespective of caste, creed, race and religion for the last 60 years but you (principal of the college) have tried to saffronise the education system in the college,” the MLA said  in the post that was written in Assamese. Aminul further stated, “You had saffronised the recently concluded Diamond Jubilee program. You showed your communal tendencies while inviting politicians. We demand that you leave this ugly communal mentality and work for the all-round development of the college instead.” He also requested student unions of the state to interfere in the matter. It should be remembered  that all colleges in Assam have a prescribed uniform including the ADP college. However, students often do not adhere to the norms strictly and hence, have to be reminded by the authorities constantly of the rules. The Principal of the college, Dr. S.K. Bhagawati, had therefore circulated a letter before the autumn vacation that students will have to wear proper uniforms while coming to college after it. Bhagawati, in response, has asserted  that of the 20% Muslim students in the college, only Aminul’s daughter attended her classes in a burqa. “All the students come to college in proper uniform as mentioned in the college prospectus. But only one student, MLA Islam’s daughter, wears burqa in college,” he said.

Karyakartas of the BJP will be standing beside the devotees of Lord Ayyappa like a rock in the battle to defend the tradition of Sabarimala, Shah has assured. Shah has also condemned the arrests of the devotees by the Kerala government in the past few days which included many BJP karyakartas. Shah remarked upon the diversity of Hindu traditions where there are many Temples that do not permit the entry of men. He has reiterated the fact that entry into Sabarimala is not related to equality in any manner and emphasized on the historical reforms undertaken by the Hindu community for the empowerment of women such widow remarriage, banning child marriage among other things. “I also ask even courts not to impose verdicts that are not practical. How can you sacrifice belief of over 5 crore devotees? Hindus never discriminated against women. In all festivals, wife sits and takes part with the man. Hindu belief and customs vary in different regions. There are many temples where only women are allowed. It is particular temples customs.” Shah said . Pinarayi Vijayan was reminded of the many court judgments that were not implemented by the state government by Amit Shah. Shah also accused him of committing atrocities on the devotees on the basis of the judgment. He said, “I tell the communist government, there are several judgments that have never been implemented: Jallikattu, Dahi Handi, loudspeakers in mosques, the opening of the chamber of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. You have never implemented any of these judgments, why this one?

However, the fact that Rahul Gandhi was protesting needlessly and Randeep Surjwala was lying through his tweet wasn’t the only thing that happened today. One Congress karyakarta valiantly decided to look dumber, presumably, to make Rahul Gandhi look smarter. During the “protest rally” today, while one karyakarta was talking to the media about Rahul Gandhi’s stupendous leadership skills, two others started sloganeering in the background. One karyakarta suddenly screamed “gali gali main shor hai”. The hope was, that the other karyakarta would jump in and say “Narendra Modi chor hai”. The assumption is, of course, based on the fact that Rahul Gandhi has been going to town calling the Prime Minister a thief baselessly and that his party workers would also follow suit.

This seems to be just another example of the same considering the violence against migrant workers in Gujarat was instigated by Alpesh Thakor and in his speech, Mevani is seen abusing the Prime Minister for it. This is not the first time Mevani has used derogatory language for Prime Minister Modi. He had earlier posted a picture of himself  with a person dressed as Prime Minister Modi, where he appeared to be apprehending the Modi-lookalike asking him to ‘end his drama’ and give answers about the promises he had made regarding job opportunities. He has also been accused of trying to instigate caste-based violence  in poll-bound Karnataka earlier this year. Not too long ago, Jignesh Mevani on Republic TV had asked the PM to “go to the Himalayas and melt his bones “. He was also caught on tape inciting people  right before violence erupted in the Bhima-Koregaon incident. Not just the PM, Jignesh Mevani was also caught on tape abusing policemen  after which, he had proceeded to play the victim. Mevani has also indulged in caste-based divisive politics. He has used the Dalit card  to spread misinformation about the death of a labourer in May this year. Mevani was also found maintaining silence  when a Dalit family was brutally beaten up for refusing to convert to Islam. That is not it. Mevani has been regularly called out on social media for sharing morphed images  of the Prime Minister. He has also indulged in target-bullying  a private individual by peddling Photoshopped images of a female columnist just because she comes from a different political ideology.",2018-10-26,"2019 general elections,Bihar,caste politics,communists,jignesh mevani,migrants,Narendra Modi,Patna","Watch: Jignesh Mevani goes on a tirade against PM Modi again, calls him ‘namak haram’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/watch-jignesh-mevani-goes-on-a-tirade-against-pm-modi-again-calls-him-namak-haram/
309,Sambit Nayak,"The debate on article 19(2) and 295A can go on while a private citizen is fighting it out against state’s might. One only hopes that our law makers also develop some sense of humour and appreciate a little sarcasm in public space. If freedom of speech is in peril, democracy is in peril. In an unusual turn of events, noted defence analyst Abhijit Iyer Mitra, who had FIRs filed against him for hurting religious sentiments through his derogatory statements on Konark Sun temple and Odisha, was arrested by Odisha police on 23rd of October. Later in the night a local SDJM court denied him bail and has sent him to 14 days judicial custody. Earlier last month, Abhijit Mitra had visited Odisha and flown over Chilika, Puri and Konark along with Baijayant Panda. On the next day, he went to Konark by road and made a sarcastic video which didn’t go well with many. After his return to Delhi, Odisha police seized the hangar and all the choppers  belonging to Jay Panda’s company IMFA on flimsy charges. On the same day, some BJD MLAs also protested inside assembly compound demanding the arrest of Jay Panda for flouting environmental rules. They also demanded the arrest of Abhijit Mitra for hurting Odia pride through his video on Konark. Reacting to this Abhijit Iyer made some distasteful comments about Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik as well as his secretary VK Pandian. In one of his tweets, he went as far as comparing Naveen with Chandashok. 2 days later on 20th October, leader of the opposition, Congress MLA Shri Narasingha Mishra moved a privilege motion against Abhijit Iyer for his nasty remarks on state legislators, which was adopted by the house. Abhijit was asked to be present before the house. On the same day, Odisha police reached Delhi to arrest Abhijit based on the FIR lodged against him in Sahid Nagar PS, Bhubaneswar and Konark PS. He got an interim bail and evaded arrest. However, the court asked him to depose before police at the said PS for further investigation and interrogation on 28th September. Abhijit then applied for an anticipatory bail in SC and requested relief from personal appearance showing a threat to his life in Odisha, given the widespread protests against him. However, SC denied his request saying if he feels threatened, jail is the safest place for him . He deposed before the House committee recently. He apologised before the committee and agreed to submit a written affidavit on Nov 2. As soon as he came out of state assembly, Sahid Nagar PS arrested him on charges of 294, 295A and IT act 67. However, the FIR at Sahid Nagar PS was not related to his video on Konark. It was rather related to some tweets he made around 1 year ago where he sarcastically remarked about the origin of the name Odisha by Bengali explorers.  He had also tweeted about Lord Jagannath originally belonging to Kolkata which was stolen by “evil Kalinga demon king”, of course, he made these remarks in jest as is evident from the tone. These are the 2 tweets on which the case is filed on Abhijit Iyer in Sahid Nagar PS. The FIR copy, which is available with us, charges Abhijit of hurting religious sentiments on these grounds and not on his video which he made at Konark.   He was lodged in Jharpada jail in Bhubaneswar after his bail was denied by the SDJM court. But his problems are far from being over. Police have started searching his phone records, tweets and emails . He is also named in another FIR filed at Konark PS over his video at the Konark temple for which Konark PS has already sought his remand . He has been produced at JFMC court in Konark for bail which was also denied. The remand application by Konark police is yet to be heard pending which he has now been remanded to Judicial custody in Nimapada jail, Puri district. This is not the first time someone passed unsavoury remarks on Odisha on social media, sarcastically or otherwise. Many have done it in the past. A social media user, who goes by the name RoflGandhi_  puts out crass jokes on the poverty of Odisha, most insensitive thing one should joke about. You can either block, mute or ignore such guys and move on. But it’s not only ordinary Twitter users, someone as senior as retired SC judge, Markandey Katju, shared this joke on Odisha and after outrage on social media, he apologised. The matter ended there. Nobody has filed cases on such incidents earlier. So what changed this time? Why such unprecedented state excess on a private citizen. What is also extraordinary is, 1-year-old tweets are being mined from archives and people are taking offence after a year. What is different in the case of Abhijit than the other cases? One theory is, it is easy to bully a common citizen than a retired supreme court judge. With all the state’s might, you can bully a citizen into silence; however, power is not permanent. Someone at a position of power needs to considerate, magnanimous and unprejudiced, not a bully. But this is not a case of bullying only. This also reeks of political vendetta. Is Abhijit Iyer just a medium here, while the real target is Jay Panda? Is Abhijit being made collateral damage in the political scuffle between BJD and Panda? Is BJD trying to send a message that Jay Panda is non-negotiable? One may also notice that Abhijit had posted some very offensive tweets on CM Naveen Patnaik  and his secretary VK Pandian. He also insinuated at corruption by Pandian and sabotaging  the probe. CM Naveen Patnaik is not known to take criticism lightly. Such unsubstantiated insinuations may have triggered unexpected state reaction. At the end of the day, it was sarcasm. Whether in poor taste is subjective. Some may like the sarcasm, some may dislike, some may even take offence. But persecuting a private citizen in such a manner by the state machinery to this extent shows how freedom can be muzzled by those in power. This also shows poorly across political spectrum where not a single politician cutting across party lines have come in his support. On the contrary, the other two leading parties in Odisha, BJP & Congress, have called for his arrest and strict punishment. Whether the tweets were malicious or intended to defame a community is for the courts to decide. But denying him bail and 14 days judicial custody for mere sarcastic tweets hints of state excess on a private citizen. Freedom of speech was never absolute in this country. The debate on article 19(2) and 295A can go on while a private citizen is fighting it out against state’s might. One only hopes that our lawmakers also develop some sense of humour and appreciate a little sarcasm in public space.

310,Raju Das,"As per the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, the central government must approve a CBI investigation in any case except taking bribe. After CBI Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana were sent on leave  pending enquiry on allegations against them, the Verma camp has been alleging that he was about to start an investigation into the Rafale deal, that’s why a scared central government removed him from his post. This claim, made by Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal, and many other politicians, activists and media houses, has two fundamental problems. First, the CBI or director had never said that they are going to probe the matter. How did opposition parties and activists know what was CBI planning to do? Does it mean that Verma or someone in CBI was leaking information about future probes? This raises a serious question about the functioning of the premier investigation agency. The second and the real problem is, CBI can’t initiate such probes on its own. It must be allocated such cases by the central government or a competent court. The Central Bureau of Investigation was formed under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. It derives its power from section 2 of the act. Section 6A of the Act states the following: 6A. Approval of Central Government to conduct, inquiry or investigation. — (1) The Delhi Special Police Establishment shall not conduct any inquiry or investigation into any offence alleged to have been committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (49 of 1988) except with the previous approval of the Central Government where such allegation relates to— (a) the employees of the Central Government of the level of Joint Secretary and above; and (b) such officers as are appointed by the Central Government in corporations established by or under any Central Act, Government companies, societies and local authorities owned or controlled by that Government. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no such approval shall be necessary for cases involving arrest of a person on the spot on the charge of accepting or attempting to accept any gratification other than legal remuneration referred to in clause (c) of the Explanation to section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (49 of 1988)]. This section makes it clear that CBI can start a probe on its own only in cases of taking a bribe. And there are not bribe allegations in the Rafale deal . In fact, there is no clear allegation of any corruption in the deal. Rahul Gandhi and others keep talking that the deal is a big scam, but nobody is sure what is the exact scam here. Nobody has accused that anyone including Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken bribe either from Dassault or Reliance while awarding the contract to supply 36 Rafale jets. Dassault’s Rafale was selected after an extensive process during the UPA government, so there is no question about a substandard product being ordered. There are allegations  that NDA government is paying more for the jets, but that allegation can’t be probed by CBI on its own, that order must come either from central government or a court, according to the law. Therefore, the claim that CBI Director Alok Verma was going to probe the Rafale deal is baseless. And if indeed he was going to do it as claimed by his camp, it would have been a violation of law, especially when the Supreme Court has already refused  to pass any order in petitions against the Rafale deal, saying that allegations against the deal “appear to be grossly inadequate”. Meanwhile, even the CBI has denied that the agency was probing the Rafale deal. The agency has said that the reports of it probing the deal are false, and said that director Alok Verma did not collect any document related to the Rafale deal.",2018-10-25,"cbi,CBI probe,Central Bureau of Investigation,central government,Congress,media lies,Media Lies List,Rafale,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies","Rahul Gandhi is lying, CBI cannot probe the Rafale deal on its own",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/rahul-gandhi-is-lying-cbi-cannot-probe-the-rafale-deal-on-its-own/
311,OpIndia Staff,"The Imran Khan government neither extended the ordinance banning terrorist outfits nor did it table it before the Parliament to convert it into an Act. The mastermind of 26/11 Mumbai attacks and UN-designated terrorist, Hafiz Saeed’s Jamat-ul-Dawa and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) are no longer in the list of banned outfits in Pakistan as per reports . Former President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain had passed  a presidential ordinance in February that amended the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 and banned the individuals and terrorist organisations listed by the UN Security Council. JuD and FIF were proscribed under this ordinance. The present Pakistan Tehereek-i-Insaf (PTI) government led by Imran Khan neither tabled the bill before the Parliament to convert it into an Act nor extended it. As a result, the ordinance has lapsed. However, this does not at all come as a surprise as Imran Khan is known to have a soft corner for terrorists. He had suggested  that Pakistani Taliban should be allowed to ‘open an office’ in Pakistan to facilitate peace talks. Hafiz Saeed had filed  a petition before the Islamabad High Court challenging the ordinance. His counsel had informed the judge about the lapse of the ordinance due to the failure of the government to extend it or table it before the Parliament for converting it into an Act. Subsequently, the judge said that Saeed’s plea was no longer effective as the ordinance was not extended by the government. This incident exposes the shallow promises  of Pakistan of maintaining peace with its neighbors. On one hand, Pakistan plays a victim of terrorism before the international community while on the other hand, it continues to allow its land to be used for terrorism and to create safe havens for terrorists. This apparent deliberate inaction of Pakistan to curb terrorist activities on its land has also led to the  USA canceling  300 billion dollars in aid to it. Pakistan has given refuge to terrorists like Osama bin Laden who was killed by the American forces in Pakistan’s Abbottabad in operation Neptune Spear . The mastermind of the Mumbai serial bomb blasts in 1993, Dawood Ibrahim, is also reported  to be staying in Pakistan. The UNSC sanctions list includes the names of terror outfits like Al-Qaeda, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, JuD, FIF and Lashkar-e-Taiba among many others. it is notable here that Pakistan’s new PM Imran Khan has developed a habit of attempting to malign India  over the suspension of bilateral talks and the Kashmir issue.

312,OpIndia Staff,"Pawar had earlier given public statements that 'Right-wing forces' were behind the Bhima Koregaon violence. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar seems to have taken a U-turn with respect to his earlier statements relating to the Bhima-Koregaon violence that took place earlier this year. According to the Indian Express report , the NCP chief Pawar has informed the Bhima-Koregaon Inquiry Commission that he was not in a position to ‘specifically make allegations against any particular organisation’ for the violence occurred near Pune on January 1 this year. Interestingly, Pawar’s recent statements submitted before the inquiry commission is contradictory to his earlier public statements, where he had blamed  the ‘right-wing forces’ for their alleged role in instigating riots in and around Pune. Pawar had said that few villagers had informed  about alleged camping of Hindutva groups near Bhima-Koregaon before the violence took place. Pawar’s recent submissions come as the Maharastra government appointed Judicial commission had asked all the political parties to ‘assist it’ by submitting affidavits containing information they hold regarding the violence. The Maharashtra government had appointed  a judicial commission, under retired justice Jai Narayan Patel, to conduct a probe into the Bhima-Koregaon violence. Besides Justice Patel, a former chief justice of the Calcutta High Court, Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sumit Mullick is also a part of the two-member panel. Sharad Pawar in his affidavit has blamed the Maharastra government  for not ensuring adequate security arrangements at Koregaon Bhima. “It is unfortunate that the state government and the law enforcement authorities failed to protect the interests of the common man residing at Koregaon Bhima and around localities in Pune district… the active role of right-wing forces behind the violence in Koregaon Bhima can’t be ruled out. However, concrete evidence can be gathered only by the law enforcement agencies of the state,” he said. Pawar has blamed the Fadnavis government for the complete failure of the law and order machinery to control a socially sensitive matter. According to Pawar, the measures adopted by the police department was inadequate to control the riots. Interestingly, Pawar has restrained from naming either Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, two Hindutva leaders who have been accused of instigating the violence. Reportedly, even in his Rajya Sabha speech had refrained taking names of these leaders but had rather focussed on blaming the state government. This reversal of his earlier stand from Sharad Pawar can be seen as an attempt to carefully position himself and his party NCP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Pawar in his affidavit blamed that social media campaign to distort historical facts and ‘maliciously propagated’ lead incite violence ahead of events on January 1. “It is unfortunate that some anti-social elements instigated violence for gaining political mileage. Unfortunately, historical facts were concocted and maliciously propagated through social media”, said Pawar. He added that a lot of rumor-mongering happened through various WhatsApp groups, Twitter handles, Facebook and other social media sites to instigate violence and between two communities, which peacefully lived with each other for the last many decades. Pawar added that ‘reasonable restrictions’ needed to be imposed on freedom of speech when serious threats to law and order existed. The violence  had broken out in the Pune district, prior to the 200th celebration of a British victory over the Peshwas. This ‘victory’ has been spun by leftist historians  as a ‘victory of Dalits’, owing to the British army supposedly comprising of Dalits and other lower castes while the ruling Peshwas were Brahmins.",2018-10-26,"Bhima Koregaon,bhima-koregaon violence,Communist violence,Dalit violence,elgar parishad,jignesh mevani,Left Wing,Pune,Sharad Pawar","Bhima Koregaon Violence: NCP supremo Sharad Pawar takes a U-turn, says cannot blame any group",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/bhima-koregaon-violence-ncp-supremo-sharad-pawar-takes-a-u-turn-says-cannot-blame-any-group/

314,Jinit Jain,"In a democracy, allies are very important, for they help you in legitimising your claim to power but one should always keep in mind the wise words of Benjamin Franklin- ""Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains enough, to be honest."" Despite its constant criticism of the BJP-led government in the centre and in Maharashtra by Shiv Sena, CM Devendra Fadnavis has dismissed speculations about BJP-Sena split and has kept his hopes alive of fighting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections together.  the session ‘4 Saal Kitna Kamaal?’ of ‘Mumbai Manthan’, Devendra Fadnavis asserted that the Shiv Sena is a part of the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra. “The Shiv Sena and the BJP would not have come together in the two governments if they had to contest separately.”Addressing Downplaying the incongruous voices within Shiv Sena, Fadnavis seemed confident about continuing the partnership with the Shiv Sena in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019. He also declared that there are only two parties in the country who talk about Hindus and Hinduism- the BJP and the Shiv Sena. However, the relationship between the BJP and Shiv Sena hasn’t been going very well for some time now. There has been a marked deterioration in their relationship. The strain in the alliance partners is also because of Sena’s unsparing attack on its ally, which particularly intensified after the BJP secured 82 seats in the 2017 BMC elections, almost equalising Sena’s tally of 84. Shiv Sena is based on pro-Marathi ideology and Hindu nationalism, which was founded on 19 June 1966 by political cartoonist Balasaheb Thackeray. People started affiliating with the party in droves. In a sense he was successful in tapping into the latent disgruntlement brewing among the local Maharashtrians and with a  The party originally emerged from a movement in Mumbai demanding preferential treatment for Maharashtrians over migrants to the city. But soon the party became reflective of a Hindu revivalist force, extolling unabashedly about its Hindu roots and serving the causing of Hinduism. However, what now remains of Shiv Sena is nothing but an organisation characterised by tempestuous leaders, for whom eccentricity has arguably become the order of the day. The party is not only fighting for custodianship of Hinduism with the BJP and RSS, but it is also struggling to uphold its founding principles laid down by Balasaheb Thackeray. It is facing tough headwinds from the BJP in its own backyard Mumbai, where the BJP has rapidly made inroads into what was traditionally Shiv Sena vote bank, compelling them to think beyond their conventional supporters. Part of this can also be attributed to Narendra Modi’s staunch pro-Hindu image and national reach. But Shiv Sena has itself to be blamed since it couldn’t provide its votaries with an intriguing alternative narrative. The Marathi-centric narrative coupled with Hindu assertion and crude hooliganism towards North-Indians had its shelf life but Shiv Sena failed to realise the need to chisel their narrative as per the changing demands. Their own followers grew weary of their hackneyed discourse and their inability to excite people with a distinct narrative that offered hope, reinvigorated them and stirred their souls into rallying behind the party, the exact thing which Prime Minister Narendra Modi could inspire in millions India became the cause of their decline. In such a scenario, it is hard to comprehend why Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis is craving to form a coalition government with them. Normally, the weak and the helpless approaches the all-powerful to form an association but this subservient penchant exhibited by most BJP leaders is rather unfathomable. On several occasions now, the BJP had to bear the brunt of the capricious nature of Shiv Sena leaders and endure their slights. Sena has always tried to punch above their weight by displaying a haughty disregard to others and claiming political snobbery. Earlier this year, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had announced  his party would go it alone in all future elections. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut snubbed  BJP saying their outreach ‘Sampark for Samarthan’ was too little too late hinting towards going alone in the 2019 polls. Shiv Sena was also seen appeasing  Muslims a few days back, which is at odds with the BJP’s no appeasement policy. Recently, Shiv Sena mocked  its poll partner with a stinging “BJP ke acche din aa gaye” remark on the fuel price hike. Today, Uddhav Thackeray criticised  CM Devendra Fadnavis for “delay” in declaring a drought. Yes, in politics there are no enemies and one has to remain circumspect of the changing dynamics but certainly not at the cost of compromising one’s own principles or dignity. It is one thing to seek support from potential allies but altogether different thing to mollycoddle them and humour their intemperate behaviour. If any understanding is not developed yet between the two parties, Fadnavis and other BJP leaders would do well to remain mute on the issue of the coalition government formation or at least be cautious in answering the questions related to it, instead of fawning over their potential coalition partner only to be snubbed later. Fadnavis can still remain agnostic about the collation with Sena till elections and then make the overtures depending upon the election result. In a democracy, allies are very important, for they help you in legitimising your claim to power but one should always keep in mind the wise words of Benjamin Franklin- “Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don’t have brains enough, to be honest.” It is better to lose on your demerits than to lose on your alliance partner’s shortfalls and vices.

315,OpIndia Staff,"India has negotiated a 9% discount on the 36 Rafale jets compared to the price of 18 jets in the previous deal In an exclusive interview  given to Economics Times editor Many Pubby, Dassault Aviation CEO Éric Trappier has strongly refuted the allegations made by Congress president Rahul Gandhi. He has said that the figures peddled by Rahul Gandhi regarding the deal are totally false and highly exaggerated. When asked about the allegation that Dassault has ‘gifted’ ₹30,000 crores in offset business, Trappier replied  that it is totally untrue. He informed that the Dassault Reliance Aerospace has been set up with a capital of ₹70 crores, which is a 49:51 joint venture between Dassault and Reliance. That means Dassault investment in the venture is just ₹35 crore, not ₹30,000 crore. He also informed that the capital in JV will be gradually increased as the operations expand, and the plan is to increase the capital in the project to ₹850 crore. So, the Dassault investment in the JV will be around ₹425 crore. And Reliance will also have to invest its portion of 51% in the JV. The Dassault CEO said that the company will produce parts of business jet Falcon and hoped that maybe, one day a complete Falcon 2000 will be made at Multi-modal International Hub Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN), where DRAL is located. When asked why Dassault described Reliance as a key partner, he replied that the JV will manufacture the Falcon, its parts and Rafale parts. As these are key products of the company, the JV needs to meet international standards. It is key because they plan to grow the JV to become a global aeronautical company. Trappier informed that Reliance is not the Indian company they are working with and they in discussion  with over 100 companies. The company has already signed up  with thirty companies located at various parts of the country. He reiterated that Dassault was under no pressure to form a JV with Reliance and it was entirely their own decision. He also reminded that the company had formed a JV  with (Mukesh Ambani’s) Reliance in 2011-12 itself. Significantly, he said that as Dassault is a family owned company they feel comfortable with another family-owned company like Reliance. He stressed that according to Defence Procurement Policy the choice of offset partner belongs to the contractor. He said, “when I choose a partner it becomes my responsibility to fulfil the obligations, to quality standards and timing. I made the choice.” Trappier also rubbished the allegations that India was paying more for 36 Rafale jets than it was supposed to pay in the earlier deal for 126 jets. In the earlier deal during UPA, 18 jets to be made in France and the rest 108 in India by HAL. According to Trappier, the unit cost for the current 36 jets is actually 9% lower than the unit cost for 18 jets in the earlier deal. He said that only the price for 18 and 36 jets bought in flyway condition must be compared, the prices for jets made in India can’t be considered in this case. He also said that if the price was increased, Dassault would not have got the contract. The CEO has rejected  that there is any corruption in the deal as claimed by opponents of the deal in India, and clarified that it is open for an investigation in the matter. “We will prove that there is no corruption. We are open, we are engineers and we want to be in India”, he said. Trappier said that they only want to develop capabilities in India not only for manufacturing but also for design and development. He said that he is a little bit sad about the controversy because India holds many opportunities that he is enthusiastic about.",2018-10-26,"Congress lies,Dassault Aviation,defence deals,Defence Ministry,France,French government,modi government,Narendra Modi,rafale deal,Rafale jets,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies","Dassault CEO Trappier demolishes every claim by Rahul Gandhi, says ‘a bit sad’ about the controversy",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/dassault-ceo-trappier-demolishes-every-claim-by-rahul-gandhi-says-a-bit-sad-about-the-controversy/

In the early morning of 24th October, the government had sent both Verma and CBI special director Rakesh Asthana on leave, as both were levelling serious allegations each other. After this, the Congress party and some leftwing activists decided to take a side in this fight inside CBI and protesting the removal of Verma from his post. Congress had planned a nation-wide protest against the government decision on 26th October, and as part of that, Rahul Gandhi took to the streets leading the march in Delhi. The Congress party workers marched from Dayal Singh College on Lodhi Road to the CBI headquarters, where several senior leaders of the party participated. Other than Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaders Ashok Gehlot, Ahmed Patel, Motilal Vora, Veerappa Moily and Anand Sharma joined the march which stopped near the CBI headquarters. Leaders from the Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, CPI(M) and other parties also joined the march. Police had put up barricades ahead of the CBI offices to prevent the protesters from reaching the building, where Rahul Gandhi got on to a truck. Terming the removal of Verma as “illegal”, Ashok Gehlot demanded that the CBI director should be reinstated. “The prime minister should tender an apology to the nation for destroying the image of the premier investigating agency,” he added. Later, Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders were detained by police and taken away from the protest site. However, in a bid to claim the victimhood victory, Congress leaders, banking on the fact that people might not be able to tell the difference, claimed that Rahul Gandhi has been ‘arrested’. The difference between ‘detention’ and ‘arrest’ is essential because the rights of an individual change drastically. In case of a person being detained, he is not formally accused of committing a crime but is simply restricted and kept in police custody on a reasonable suspicion. During the time in custody, he is questioned or investigated by the police authorities. After the police questioning, the person detained would be released. The situation would be entirely different if a person was arrested. A person can only be arrested if he is charged for a crime and once he is arrested and has to be produced before a magistrate within the next 24 hours. In certain situations, an initial detention may lead to an arrest. Congress leader Randeep Singh Sirjewala tweeted that Rahul Gandhi and others have been ‘arrested’. The protesting leaders were taken to the Lodhi Colony police station in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi’s reasons for this ‘protest’ were dubious to begin with. When the court itself has decided that the investigation is to be completed within 2 weeks, for Rahul Gandhi to disrupt civilian life and create a ruckus made no sense. Now, with Congress politicians and media playing the “arrest” card and confusing their readers about the difference between detention and arrest, it is clear that Congress’ intention is to simply grab headlines by whatever means possible.",2018-10-26,"arrested,cbi,Congress,Congress lies,Detained,March,protest,protests,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies","No, Rahul Gandhi has not been ‘arrested’, he has been ‘detained’ after his ‘protest’ over the CBI fracas",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/no-rahul-gandhi-has-not-been-arrested-he-has-been-detained-after-his-protest-over-the-cbi-fracas/

As per local newspaper Matrubhumi, over 1400 people have been arrested  by the Kerala Police in connection with the protests preventing the entry of women between the age of 10 and 50 years of age at the Sabarimala Temple. Over 258 cases have reportedly been filed too. The police have also published photos of more than 200 people involved in the protests and intends to publish more soon. Matrubhumi reports that the photo of a policeman named Ibrahim Kutty of Pathanamthitta AR camp was included by mistake in the list of photos of devotees. Other media outlets have also reported mass arrests by the Kerala Police in a massive crackdown against devotees of Lord Ayyappa. As per reports , the Police had filed cases against 2000 persons and issued a lookout notice against 210. 71 persons are said to have been taken into custody in Ernakulam, 40 in Kozhikkode and 30 each in Palakkad and Pathanamthitta districts. In addition, 30 people were reportedly  arrested at Kozhikode before being let off. All of them allegedly belonged to the Bharatiya Janata Party or other Hindutva outfits. We have reported  earlier that the Kerala government plans to fortify the areas around the Sabarimala Temple with a massive police force to regulate the entry and exit of devotees. It is assumed that it would make it easier for the communists to help the activists desecrate the abode of Lord Ayyappa. The communist party is facing wide criticism  due to its highhandedness in dealing with the devotees of Lord Ayyappa.

In the ongoing tussle between two factions of the CBI, the government of the day, citing ongoing investigations, has sent  both the officers involved Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma on leave. However, the Opposition, ready to attack the Modi government on almost any and every incident that takes place in the country, has claimed  that Verma’s ouster is because of his keenness to probe the Rafale deals. Stating that the country and the constitution are in ‘danger’ Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Verma was forcefully sent on leave because he was ‘collecting documents in the Rafale scam’. Congress official handle, too, tweeted on similar lines that ‘democracy is in danger’. These claims, by all standards, seem concocted and fantastical with no evidence as back up. However, while lending their support to Verma, Congress is conveniently forgetting that when he was appointed as the new CBI chief in January 2017, Congress had vehemently opposed  his appointment. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge had given a dissent note when Verma was appointed as the CBI chief citing he had no experience of having served in CBI and also had very little experience in vigilance. Verma is a 1979 batch IPS officer from Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territories (AGMUT) cadre and was appointed CBI director for a period of 2 years by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet. Not-so-surprisingly, Congress is not the only one who has suddenly changed their stance on Verma. Supreme Court lawyer and now-ousted Aam Aadmi Party founding member Prashant Bhushan , too, extended his support to Verma after having opposed his appointment terming it ‘illegal’.

For the first time, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju was part of India’s delegation in a bilateral security meet with China as per reports . However his presence on the delegation riled China as Rijiju hails from the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh which China claims as part of its own territory. As per reports, the Chinese made a strong representation to object this arrangement and had even asked for correction of this “wrong move”. Rijiju was initially on the delegation but on Chinese insistence, his name was dropped. He had been kept off the meetings with Chinese officials until Monday. On Monday, while the restricted dialogue was underway between Rajnath Singh and Zhao Kezai, China’s Minister of Public Security, Rijiju was called  in to participate in delegation-level talks. He was also part of the document signing. The Home Ministry spokesperson confirmed Rijiju’s presence in the meeting but pleaded ignorance to any protest from the Chinese side. Rijiju’s presence in the meeting held on Monday with Chinese officials is significant as until this time, the Indian government had been conceding to the sensitivities of China regarding Arunachal Pradesh. China had earlier protested  against any high-level visits to Aunachal. It is for the same reason that Rijiju was absent from delegation-level talks during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in September 2014. He also skipped the President of India’s state banquet for his Chinese counterpart during that visit.  to the statement of MHA, during the meeting held on Monday, issues of mutual interest, including bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation were discussed, and both the sides welcomed increased cooperation between India and China in the area of security cooperation.According In April 2017, during the visit of the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh, China had warned about taking “necessary measures” to defend its territorial sovereignty and accused India of “obstinately” allowing the Tibetan spiritual leader to visit the “disputed” parts of the Northeastern state, causing “serious damage” to bilateral ties.",2018-10-24,"arunachal pradesh,China,foreign policy,Home Ministry,India China border,indo-china,kiren rijiju,Northeast,Northeast India",Kiren Rijiju’s presence in the bilateral security meet annoys the Dragon,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/kiren-rijijus-presence-in-the-bilateral-security-meet-annoys-the-dragon/
320,OpIndia Staff,"It is important to note that no case of Rafale deal was allotted to CBI, and nobody from CBI had announced that they are probing the deal. If the Congress party and left-wing activists have access to confidential information from CBI, that is actually a big issue. After CBI Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana was sent on leave, the opposition parties and left-wing activists have gone on overdrive in defending the Director. Congress party has alleged that Verma was going to investigate the Rafale deal and that’s why the government has ‘transferred’ him. Several activists have claimed that CBI Director has a ‘collegium protected tenure’ and the central government can’t sack him. Prashant Bhushan claims PM has no authority to send CBI director on leave as his tenure is protected. The claim that the government has removed Alok Verma is false. The CBI director has been sent only on leave, along with number two in the agency Special Director Rakesh Asthana. It is interesting that while people like Prashant Bhushan were opposing the appointment of Asthana by the Modi government, and even filed a PIL at SC against the appointment, are supporting Verma now. This clearly shows that in this ugly fight inside the CBI, the opposition parties and left liberals have taken a clear side. They have deliberately ignored the fact that Rakesh Asthana also has been sent on leave, and offices of both the officers were sealed. It is important to remember that there are allegations of corruption against both the top officers of CBI, and both the allegations must be investigated fairly. As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said  today, CBI is the premier investigating institution in the country, and there can’t be any doubt about the integrity of the agency. Not only in India, but in other countries also CBI’s reputation must be spotless. As there are serious allegations against both the officers, impartial investigation into them is a must. If the officers continue in their jobs, that would not be possible. The officers can not supervise investigations against themselves, that would be a mockery of the process. That’s why both the director and special director has been sent on leave so that an impartial investigation can be ensured. The government has not sacked Alok Verma, only sent on a leave, so violating his fixed 2-year term does not arise. After the Lokpal Act was passed, the appointment of CBI director is now governed by this act, according to which a panel comprising Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and Leader of the Opposition selects the CBI Director. But the functioning of the agency still comes under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, under which CBI was formed. According to the finance minister, the CVC had recommended under the CVC Act and DSPE Act that the investigations cannot be conducted by the concerned two officers or under the supervision of them. That’s why it was decided that for the institutional integrity of CBI, and to maintain fairness in investigations, the two officers will sit out of CBI till the time the investigation is completed, as an interim measure. Referring to conspiracy theories that CBI director was going to investigate the Rafale deal, Arun Jaitley said that this also casts a serious doubt. He said that if the accusation is true, that means the opposition parties and activists have access to future plans of CBI director, and that raises a big question on the integrity of the person. Even Rahul Gandhi tweeted the same allegation, which points towards the probable existence of a Congress informer inside CBI. And if they are not getting inside information, that would mean the allegation is untrue and baseless. It is important to note that no case of Rafale deal was allotted to CBI, and nobody from CBI had announced that they are probing the deal.

Earlier this month, Patrika, a very popular Hindi language news publication published a story claiming  that the Uttar Pradesh government has purchased a ₹ 84 crore helicopter for chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The report claimed that the nine-seater chopper has been procured from the United States of America and has been tested in mountain regions before being handed over to the UP government. However, the Uttar Pradesh government had soon clarified that no such helicopter has been procured by the UP government. Despite the clarification by the Uttar Pradesh government, Patrika has not yet updated the story. Not only that, Arvind Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party, in a bid to take a dig at Yogi government, spread lies that Yogi Adityanath bought a helicopter for himself.

This post has some lies and some half-truths. While the Congress-led Punjab government, reeling under the debt of almost 2 lakh crore, has indeed issued  orders for buying SUVs for ministers, the total cars are for the chief minister, minister, MLAs as well as bureaucrats.

This announcement had stirs red up a massive political crisis in the state, following which, the lawmakers then met the then governor C Vidyasagar Rao, asking for the removal of Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, expressing no confidence in him. Alleging mala fide intentions by the Speaker,  the MLAs had moved the Madras High Court, which led to a split verdict by Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar on 14 June. As the matter was further transferred to the apex court, the Supreme Court had then named Justice Sathyanarayanan, who refused to take the case up to the SC. After 12 days of hearing, he reserved his orders until August 31. The E K Palaniswami-led government has finally been given an answer regarding the matter today , as the Madras High Court upheld the Tamil Nadu Speaker’s decision to finally disqualify the 18 rebel AIADMK MLAs. The rebels who were supporting the Sasikala-Dhinakaran faction were disqualified by P Dhanapal, the Speaker of the House, under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution (known as the anti-defection law) after they expressed lack of confidence in Chief Minister E Palaniswami. Tamil Nadu Law Minister CV Shanmugham hailed the verdict and said , “It’s a victory for our party and a lesson for criminals.” On the other hand, bravely facing the verdict, Dinakaran asserted that it has been an “experience”, refusing to term it a “setback.” He said, “The court judgment is not going to deter us. We will face the future with more force. The verdict will unite the party and MLAs even closer together.” Two seats are now vacant in the 234-member Assembly, including that of late DMK chief M Karunanidhi.

326,OpIndia Staff,"Lawyer Vibhor Anand had petitioned for disqualifying 27 AAP MLAs for holding office of profit Today President Ramnath Kovind officially dismissed  a plea to disqualify 27 ruling Aam Admi Party MLAs of Delhi. The dismissal was based on an opinion given by the Election Commission (EC) in July, having “found no merit in the plea.” In 2016, Delhi based lawyer Vibhor Anand had discovered  that several AAP MLAs were appointed as Chairpersons of RKS -Rogi Kalyan Samitis (Patient Welfare Committees) of various government hospitals in Delhi. Since these posts were not exempted via any notification by the GNCTD (Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi), Anand found them to be instances of holding an office of profit. He then made a list of 27 such MLAs and filed a complaint with the Election Commission, asserting that rules allowed an MLA only to be a member of the governing committee and not a Chairperson, alleging that the appointment of the MLAs as Chairpersons of RKSs itself was, thereby, illegal. On further investigation, he found that there were not just 27, but 37 MLAs who were appointed Chairpersons in RKSs were also involved in corruption. He then planned to file a PIL in the Delhi High Court soon seeking action against them. Such pleas are usually  sent to the President, who then forwards it to the EC which studies the matter further and forwards it back to the President for his final orders.

327,K Bhattacharjee,"Going forward, the devotees of Lord Ayyappa have shown the way for Hindus in the rest of the country on how to organize peaceful protests to achieve our ends. Anyone who says the protests were not overwhelmingly by and large peaceful is deliberately setting impossible standards for Hindus. The events of the past few days in Kerala have set things in motions which will have consequences for years to come. Too many things have happened in a very short period of time and now that the first chapter of the Battle for Sabarimala is over with a definitive victory for the devotees, it’s time that we look back on several events of great importance which holds great sociopolitical significance for the future of the state as well as for the whole nation. The Sabarimala verdict has immensely dented the credibility of the highest court of the country. Certain judgments in the past had already made citizens of the country wary of the court and verdict that outlawed the tradition of Lord Ayyappan at Sabarimala was the final nail in the coffin. Hindus openly revolted against the verdict braving all manners of threats, arrests and atrocities by the state machinery. And in the end, they emerged with a resounding victory. The message to the Indian Judiciary was clear, unwanted meddling with Temple traditions will not be tolerated and will be resisted tooth and nail. The manner in which Kerala Police attacked peaceful devotees left a bitter taste in many people’s mouth, even supporters of the communist party. The zeal with which the communist party in power sought to implement the Supreme verdict is practically unheard of, especially in cases where religious practices are involved. There have been many instances when state governments have stayed court verdicts for fear of a law and order situation. However, in this particular instance, the Communist party was hell bent on employing every weapon under its arsenal to ensure that the sacred abode of the Deity was defiled. We can only speculate on the reasons that motivated the communist party to act and behave in the manner that it did. But what appears certain is that there was some massive miscalculation on the part of the Pinarayi Vijayan led Left government in Kerala. It appears evident that Pinarayi is under the impression that the people involved with the protests do not belong to his core votebank. He likely believes that, by and large, those involved with the protests are associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Thus, in his mind, the crackdown on the devotees was action against political opponents. As I have said earlier, it appears that Pinarayi is gravely mistaken. Given the massive magnitude of the protests, it appears highly unlikely that the protests were driven by any political organization. Moreover, there have been reports of communist party workers resigning from the party in revolt against the police crackdown on devotees. There is widespread resentment against the manner in which the state government conspired to desecrate the Temple by awarding protection to activists who clearly did not seek entry due to some outpouring of devotion towards Lord Ayyappan. Some people in the Left government have obviously sensed the public mood and are trying to backtrack from the initial bravado that the government put up. At one point, Kadakampally Surendran, the State Devaswom (religious trusts) minister, stated  that the Temple will not be allowed to become a place where activists can come and showcase their power. It was only after the devotees had prevented two women from entering the Temple after a massive confrontation with the Police. Pinarayi Vijayan, however, a hallmark of the manner in which the ideologically blinded lose their sight of reality, refuses to see the writing on the wall. On Tuesday, he chose to attack the Tantri instead. He is reported to have said , “Ayyappan is believed by a section of the devotees as a ‘naishtika brahmachari’ (eternal celibate). It’s true. There are beliefs that some deities are celibate. At such temples, mostly in northern India, the priest must also be celibate. That’s the truth. He must not marry. You all know the ‘celibate’ status of our priest here (at Sabarimala). I am not just talking about being occupied with a household. He has crossed that to enter a state of prostitution. Isn’t that what happened at Ernakulam?” He did not stop there and claimed that the Temple was the property of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and not to any individual entity or family, an obvious dig at the Tantri and the Pandalam Royal Family who have an intimate relationship with Lord Ayyappan. The Communist party, thus far, is coming across as extremely heartless and arrogant. It appears that Pinarayi Vijayan, the committed communist, was beaten by the one thing that the ideologically committed materialists cannot entirely comprehend: the will of the Devas and the power of Religion. Plenty of people on social media have been pleading with the central government to intervene in the matter. They hoped that Prime Minister Modi would at least issue a statement on the distressing events that transpired in Kerala. However, they were left hugely disappointed when Narendra Modi maintained a stoic silence on the issue. Things hit rock bottom when a senior leader of the BJP suggested  that the center should provide military and paramilitary forces to ensure that women have access to the Temple. All in all it appeared that the BJP was failing devotees in Kerala spectacularly. It is also pertinent to remember that the party initially appeared to support the Supreme Court verdict. The situation on the ground could not be more different. Local leaders of the party were hyperactive in coordinating with devotees and others to ensure that the sanctity of the Temple was preserved. By all accounts, BJP leaders in Kerala conducted themselves honourably in the whole matter and engaged with the devotees to register significant protests in the state. There have been reports of BJP leaders even spending sleepless nights in defence of Sabarimala. The state unit of the BJP has indeed conducted itself with the public’s wishes in mind and done the party immense favours in the state. However, despite their contribution, they cannot be credited with spearheading the protests as the party came out in support of devotees only after it became clear that public mood was greatly against the verdict. In the end of it all, it would be fair to state that despite the silence from the senior leadership of the party, the local leaders ensured that the party earned great respect in the eyes of the devotees. It is still too early to ascertain the magnitude of the impact the entire series of events will have on electoral politics. However, one thing is for certain. The events will undeniably undermine the communist party in Kerala, the extent is unclear as of now. Until the events that transpired at Sabarimala in October, the Left’s hold over power appeared extremely secure. However, now, all political equations have been thrown into chaos. The extent to which the BJP will benefit electorally from the circumstances will be entirely dependent on the contribution of the local leaders as of now. However, the more Pinarayi blames the RSS and the BJP, the more it will be beneficial for the BJP. The Sabarimala protests may well turn out to be the Singur moment for communists in Kerala. Even at Singur, the writing was the wall but the bull-headed approach of the party led to its total decimation in West Bengal. Whether that fate awaits the Left in Kerala we will have to wait and see but assuredly, the BJP has now gained a strong foothold in the southern state. Undoubtedly, the real heroes of the Battle for Sabarimala were the devotees of Lord Ayyappa who have definitively won the first round. It was entirely the initiative of the devotees themselves which forced political organizations to get themselves involved with the protests. A great deal of credit goes to the women of all ages who came out onto the streets to protect the abode of Lord Ayyappa. The mothers, daughters and sisters of Kerala have earned great Punya with their conduct during these troubled times. In every battle, there are certain warriors who deserve a special mention. Activists from People for Dharma have done a remarkable job of conducting the initial protest marches and coordinating with the Royal Family for the same. Anjali George and Padma Pillai deserve a great deal of credit for their unwavering contribution to the resistance. Padma Pillai was even charitable enough to walk into debates with people who were visibly hostile to her to explain her position and yet appear cool and collected throughout the whole ordeal. One unlikely hero to have emerged from the series of events is Rahul Easwar. He was only recently granted bail following his arrest on the 17th of October due to his involvement with the protests. He may go back to spouting Gandhian inanities sooner rather than later but he stood up when it mattered and for that, he has earned a great deal of respect even from people who were earlier not fond of him. And he has proved through his actions that he is a much greater man than those of us who have mocked him harshly in the past, albeit for fair reasons. Another hero of the battle was IG Sreejith, the police officer who escorted two activists in their bid to desecrate the Temple on Friday. Later, he could be seen weeping profusely at the Temple while apologizing to the Deity for his conduct. It was perhaps one of the most iconic moments of the protests. It is quite evident that he was caught in a very difficult position. But even then, unlike previous occasions when the Police appeared to bulldoze through devotees, IG Sreejith was reportedly conversing with the devotees about the situation and trying to persuade them insisting that he, in his personal capacity, had to uphold the law. Eventually, he did not resort to committing atrocities on the devotees and instead escorted the activists back. Later, at the Temple, as per some videos circulating on WhatsApp, the police officer could be seen shaking hands with the devotees and sharing a smile with them, presumably after he had wept and apologized to the Deity. The mainstream media has demonstrated yet again why so many Indians consider them to be the enemy of the people. Their conduct during the protests was shameful, disgusting and nauseating. They were surely aware that the crux of the whole protests was disallowing any female entry into the Temple. Despite knowing the odds that were at stake, the bigwigs in their air-conditioned rooms allowed their junior female colleagues to walk into the chaos of the protests without considering the danger they were putting them through. The entire mainstream media has become one large activist block who frequently forget how to do their job properly. They completely sided with the activists who sought to desecrate the Temple ignoring the atrocities that were perpetrated on the devotees. They painted devotees as riot mongers and barbaric without giving due credence to their side of the story and right from the onset, it was quite evident that their ideological priorities would mar their entire coverage of the events. Arnab Goswami, especially, appeared to have a personal vendetta against the devotees of Lord Ayyappa. He was railing and screaming in his newsroom like the monotheist zealots of yore who were driven into a maddening rage affronted by the fact that the pagans were defending themselves against attempts to defile their faith. There was one media channel, Janam TV, which earned a great deal of affection from the devotees for their coverage of the protests. In what is an extremely rare sight, devotees could be seen hugging and kissing and hoisting the Janam TV journalist up on their shoulders while celebrating their victory. It is pretty hard to watch the video without a smile on one’s face. The greatest outcome of the entire series of events was the fact that Lord Ayyappa has definitively entered the national consciousness and united Hindus from all across the country in a manner that has not been since the Ram Janambhoomi Movement. On social media, and elsewhere, it was quite obvious that the attack on the Sabarimala Temple had resonated profoundly with every Hindu who was frustrated and angry with the manner our festivals were being targeted. Therefore, when images of the police crackdown on devotees surfaced, all Hindus united to voice their vigorous support to the devotees in their fight. Social media was overflowing with chants of ‘Swamiye Sharanam Ayyappa’ and it was regardless of any regional divide. North, South, East, West did not matter. The only thing that mattered was the preservation of the sanctity of Sabarimala and everyone prayed fervently to that end. There were a lot of factors that brought about such an outcome. Hatred for the mainstream media, hatred for the Judiciary, dissatisfaction with the political parties, Hindus have felt hard done by the entire state machinery for quite a while. The attack on Sabarimala was the last straw. It won’t be surprising at all if Hindus from the North and other parts of the country start observing the 41-day Vrat and other related rituals to travel to Sabarimala for the pilgrimage. Going forward, the devotees of Lord Ayyappa have shown the way for Hindus in the rest of the country on how to organize peaceful protests to achieve our ends. Anyone who says the protests were not overwhelmingly by and large peaceful is deliberately setting impossible standards for Hindus. Until there’s an ordinance from the central government, it appears highly unlikely that the state government will relent on their doomed pursuit to implement the Supreme Court verdict. Pinarayi’s statements have made it clear, he sees the protests as a political attempt to undermine the Left government in Kerala and will respond to it politically with the might of the state behind him. As per reports, four more women have approached the court for protection to visit the Temple. When the Temple reopens on the 5th of November, the Temple will once again be turned into a battleground. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court will hear the review petitions on the 13th of November. The battle has been won but the War is not yet over.",2018-10-24,"Arnab Goswami,BJP,judicial activism,kerala government,Kerala Police,Lord Ayyappa,mainstream media,Pinarayi Vijayan,RSS,Sabarimala,SabarimalaVerdict,supreme court","Battle for Sabarimala: Consequences, fall-out of Communist atrocity, its heroes and hope for new dawn",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/the-battle-for-sabarimala-consequences-fall-out-communist-action-its-heroes-and-the-hope-for-a-new-dawn/
328,OpIndia Staff,"Denial of the Kashmiri Pandit genocide and ignoring the rampant Islamic terrorism in Kashmir by Azad is only the latest evidence of it. The Jammu and Kashmir government had ordered schools, colleges and public libraries in the state to ensure that Urdu versions of religious scriptures like the Gita and the Ramayana were available in its stock. “The School Education Department, Higher Education Department, Director Colleges, Director Libraries and Culture Department will consider purchasing sufficient number of copies each of Urdu version of “Shrimad Bhagwat-Geeta” and “Koshur Ramayan” authored by Shri Sarwanand Premi for making these available in Schools/ Colleges and public libraries etc. of the State,” reads an order  dated October 22, 2018.” Since then, after much outrage from the usual suspects, the government has withdrawn its order. “Circular issued by the education department regarding the introduction of some religious books stands withdrawn ab initio under the orders of the chief secretary,” Jammu and Kashmir Police said  in a tweet on Tuesday. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has come out and supported the withdrawal of the order directing Hindu religious scriptures to be made available in the state. It is unclear what Azad means when he says that Kashmir has never witnessed any communalism. The facts of the Kashmiri Pandit genocide  are quite well known. At present, Kashmir is a hotbed of radical Islamic terrorism with even flags  of the dreaded terrorist outfit ISIS making their presence felt in the state. More bewilderingly, the outrage against the availability of Hindu religious scriptures in public libraries is itself intrinsically communal in nature. But according to Azad, it appears Islamic intolerance towards Hinduism is not communal in nature. Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been trying desperately  to shed his party’s anti-Hindu image.

329,OpIndia Staff,"Prashant Bhushan had called Alok Verma's appointment illegal, now he is calling his removal from office illegal too. Amidst the ongoing battle between two factions of the CBI, the government of the day, citing ongoing investigations, has sent  both the officers involved Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma on leave. But this has not gone down well with some of the known Modi Government detractors. According to the SC lawyer Prashant Bhushan, the BJP government removed Alok Verma from his office as he was pursuing corruption charges on Special Director CBI Rakesh Asthana. Bhushan also alleged Asthana’s involvement in the Rafale deal was the reason for the government’s alacrity to protect him from Verma’s investigation. The government had already claimed that they have sent both the officers on leave. In the meanwhile, the government has appointed senior IPS officer M Nageshwar Rao, a joint director within the CBI to take over the duties and functions of CBI Director with immediate effect. This decision comes soon after it was reported that Asthana and Verma had both been summoned  by the Prime Minister. If this wasn’t enough, Prashant Bhushan has insinuated charges of corruption against M Nageshwar Rao and called him a tainted officer. But this didn’t go down well with an aware Twitter user (@iAnkurSingh), who took it upon himself to out Prashant Bhushan’s shameless hypocrisy. As outed by Ankur, it can be seen that Prashant Bhushan, in the past, had moved to the Supreme Court terming appointment of CBI Chief Alok Verma as ‘illegal’. The SC had then quashed Bhushan’s petition and refused  to interfere in his appointment. Bhushan had also insinuated that Alok Verma was appointed by the Modi government to protect the corrupts. Today, Prashant Bhushan is vehemently protesting against the government’s move of asking Alok Verma to proceed on leave. One cannot help but wonder what motivates Prashant Bhushan to take such diametrically opposite stance in just over 20 months. From calling Alok Verma’s appointment as ‘illegal’ to his ouster as ‘illegal’, Prashant Bhushan’s flip-flops have sent his followers in a tizzy. It also testifies that Bhushan’s only aim is to stop Modi, even if it comes at the cost of being exposed as a churlish hypocrite. In the past too Prashant Bhushan has been accused  of sharing fake news from dubious sources just to sustain his campaign against the Modi government. When the veracity of the news was outed, he quietly deleted his post without tendering an apology. This has become a pattern now. Prashant Bhushan has attempted to spread misinformation and half-baked allegations several times in the past. He had alleged recently that PM Modi had arranged  for Mehul Choksi’s Antiguan citizenship. He had also circulated a ‘news clip’  that claimed that Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Jio has bought 30 crores phones from China and it is a big scam.

331,OpIndia Staff,"Young voters learned their democratic responsibilities through a 1600 square foot game of snake and ladder Barmer district in Rajasthan is all set to hold a new Limca Book record, for organising the biggest Snake and ladder game in the country. As per reports , the district administration in Rajasthan held a unique Snake and ladder game event on Tuesday, on a 1600 square foot board specially designed to create awareness among voters. The game had similar rules as the traditional snake and ladder game. ‘Voters’ get bitten by the snake if they ignore norms or cast votes for money, alcohol or any other pressure. Prospective votes also get bitten by the snake if they fail to register on the voter’s list, ignore to vote or involve in spreading rumours. A ‘voter’ got to climb the ladders if he/she had followed the norms, registered their name in the list and also helped to create awareness among others. Ladders also meant the ‘voters’ have helped others like the elderly or differently abled people to cast their vote. The assistant district electoral officer Rakesh Kumar reportedly had told  the media that the event to be held at the MBC women’s college campus would be the biggest  game of Snake and ladder organised in the country and will be entered in the Limca Book of records. Interestingly, the previous Limca Book record for organising the biggest game of Snake and ladder also belongs to the Barmer district. In 2013, Barmer had organised Snake and ladder game over a 900 square foot flex where schoolchildren were taught the benefits of water conservation . Prepared by the Information Education Communication (IEC) cell of the Public Health and Engineering Department. The huge flex was also moved around to all the schools of the district for children to participate and learn. It was entered in the Limca Book of Records that year.

Patwari, who is an MLA from Rau assembly constituency and was made Congress Working President  in April this year for the upcoming assembly elections in the state, is seen doing a ‘Jan Sampark’ campaign in the video where he goes to the homes of voters in his constituency and asks for votes. He is clearly heard telling his voters to vote for him and keep his honour while disregarding the party.

334,Raju Das,"Satish Sana has claimed he bribed Rakesh Asthana without ever meeting or talking to him In an unprecedented move , today union government sent both the Director and the Special Director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on leave, followed by the ugly fight between the two that unravelled last few weeks. Last week, CBI director Alok Verma had filed an FIR against number special director Rakesh Asthana on corruption charges, along with few other CBI officials. It was alleged that Asthana Had taken money from meat exporter Moin Qureshi to suppress cases against Qureshi. On the other hand, Asthana had also complained with CVC Verma was trying to frame him. He has also alleged that it was Verma who had taken the bribe and was trying to suppress investigation into the IRCTC tendering scam and the INX media case. The FIR against Asthana relied on one Hyderabad based businessman Satish Sana, who had notified about bribes paid to Asthana. But now experts have found some loopholes in the FIR, according to a report. Two other persons involved in the case are Dubai based Manoj Prasad and Somesh Prasad, and Sana had claimed that he frequently talked with Manoj Prasad using WhatsApp. Sana had also claimed that he had paid ₹1.95 crore as the second instalment of the bribe to one Sunil Mittal, who is the father-in-law of Somesh Prasad. But CBI has not talked to Sunil Mittal yet, which seems to be a glaring lapse in the investigation. Talking to media, Mittal has denied  the allegation of taking the money and claimed that he has never meet Satish Sana. Sana had claimed that the money was paid to Mittal at the parking lot of Press Club of India, but Mittal says he was not present there at that time, and he has proof that he was at the Gymkhana Club. Sana claims  that he was being questioned by CBI officer Devender Kumar, who used to repeatedly summon Sana. Last year Sana went to Dubai, met Somesh Prasad through Manoj Prasad. Somesh called someone through WhatsApp calling, talked about the case, and told Sana that this person can solve his problem. He showed the display picture of the person on his phone, telling him that it is CBI special director Rakesh Asthana. Satish Sana Googled Asthana and found that picture is correct and agreed to pay ₹5 crore, without about talking to him, forget about meeting him in person! That is the version given by Sana, he has never claimed that he knows Asthana or he directly paid money to him. It is noteworthy that Rakesh Asthana had sought custodial interrogation of Sana from the CBI director in the case against Sana and had also opened a lookout circular against Sana. Satish Sana himself is being investigated in the corruption case, and CBI’s case against its special director is based on testimony given by Sana. Sana says he paid the bribe to Asthana without ever meeting or talking to him, he did it because he saw Asthana’s picture as display picture of a contact in someone’s else phone, and that has become a basis for FIR against CBI special director. It is also been reported that Alok Verma was against the appointment of Asthana as special director from the beginning, but that does not seem to be true. A petition was filed in the Supreme Court against the appointment of Asthana, but the top court had dismissed  the petition, saying that there was no case against the officer. The court had also observed that Asthana was selected by a unanimous decision of the Selection Committee, and director Verma himself was part of the discussions.",2018-10-24,"cbi,CBI probe,corruption charges,investigation,modi government,Narendra Modi,National Investigation Agency,Rakesh Asthana,Whatsapp",CBI’s case against Rakesh Asthana is based on a Whatsapp display picture and a man accused of corruption,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/cbis-case-against-rakesh-asthana-is-based-on-a-whatsapp-display-picture-and-a-man-accused-of-corruption/
335,OpIndia Staff,"This revelation came in the wake of reports hypothesising that the Congress is likely to field fewer Muslim candidates in the upcoming assembly election in Rajasthan than the last time. With Rajasthan assembly elections round the corner, the state joint forum of the major Muslim organisations in Rajasthan has started voicing  their demands over ticket distribution from ‘secular parties’ in proportion to the population. The forum proclaiming the current situation to be fatal for the country’s democratic system expressed concern over the declining ratio of Muslim representation in the assembly. The forum conveners, Qari Moinuddin, Muhammad Nazimuddin, Hafiz Abrar Ahmed, Advocate Packer Farooq said that all ‘secular political parties’ must ensure participation of all religious sections including Muslims. Last month it was also reported  how the president of the Congress party’s minority cell in Rajasthan, Nizam Quereshi, had appealed to the Congress party demanding 18-20 seats exclusively for candidates from the Muslim community. This revelation came in the wake of reports hypothesising that the Congress is likely to field fewer Muslim candidates in the upcoming assembly election in Rajasthan than the last time. A senior Congress leader had made it clear that “There is a clear direction from the high command that tickets should be given to candidates who can win. We will not unnecessarily get into any kind of balancing act. At the end of the day, only seats will be counted.” A political analyst named Anil Kumar Singh had however asserted that the move appeared to be in sync with the party’s strategic shift  to soft Hindutva. “In its campaign so far, the Congress has not raised issues related to minorities at high decibel. Its president, Rahul Gandhi, is visiting temples and offering puja on his visits. It clearly indicates that the Congress looks to ‘kill’ BJP with its own medicine,” he said. The Rajasthan Muslim forum, however, demanded  that tickets should be given to nominees who belong to the weaker section of the society and to people who would understand Muslim predicaments and would put in the effort to resolve them rather than to candidates with communal and criminal backgrounds considering they are popular and have better chances of winning. The Forum further advised the ‘secular parties’ to consult the representatives of the Muslim to include the issue of security, education, employment etc for minorities in the party manifesto. While all parties gear up for 2019 general elections it was reported  a few months back how Rahul Gandhi in his desperate attempt to boost his image, had met some Muslim intellectuals and activists at his residence. Interestingly, the leaders of the so-called Muslim intellectual class had then conveyed their displeasure over the Congress Party’s recent narrative of being soft to Hindus. During the meeting, the intellectuals had also advised  Rahul Gandhi to do a “self-introspection of the Congress party”, claiming that the party had changed a lot in recent times. Congress apparently is now sitting on a powder keg. While Rahul Gandhi declared  himself as a ‘janeu dhari Hindu’ in a bid to appease the Hindu electorate which has been disgruntled with Congress for a while owing to its “Hindu Pakistan” and “Saffron Terror” sort of remarks, the Muslim community which has been Congress’ core vote bank, considering how Congress has appeased the minority for decades, seems disgruntled at this pseudo-Hindutva stand. Considering that the Congress party is now stuck in a baited trap , it would be interesting to see what would be the parties trajectory in the upcoming elections. Rajasthan, along with four other states, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Telangana and Chhattisgarh go to polls  in the upcoming weeks. Rajasthan will vote on 7th December and the counting of votes will take place on 11th December.",2018-10-24,"2018 Assembly Elections,2019 general elections,Congress,minority appeasement,Muslim Appeasement,muslim vote bank,Muslims,Pseudo-secularism,rahul gandhi,rajasthan,Rajasthan Assembly Election,Secularism",Rajasthan state Muslim forum demands election tickets from ‘secular parties’ in proportion to the population,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/rajasthan-state-muslim-forum-demands-election-tickets-from-secular-parties-in-proportion-to-the-population/
336,Nirwa Mehta,"One has to wonder why Shehla would take the news of a natural death and spin it in a manner that enables her to call mere detention camps and concentration camps indicating that he died of 'torture by state'.  In states where illegal immigrants are detected  as foreigners by the Foreigners’ Tribunals (FTs) under the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, if they go untraced for a long time, it creates hurdles in deporting them to their country of origin. Hence to restrict their movements and to ensure they do not ‘perform the act of vanishing’ it was decided that they would be kept in detention centres. The central government has authorised state governments to set up detention centres and accordingly, there are six detention centres in Assam at Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Tezpur, Jorhat, Dibrugarh and Silchar. Recently, it was reported  that two persons who were in one of the centres, died, one of whom, Mohammad Jabbar Ali died of old age-related health issues. As per the reports, they had papers to show their nationality, but were unable to provide the same to Foreigners’ Tribunals due to “wrong legal advice”. JNU freelance protestor and PhD scholar Shehla Rashid decided to compare the detention centres, which have been mandated by the Central Government under the provisions of Section 3(2) (e) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and Para 11(2) of the Foreigners Order, 1948, to the ‘concentration camps’ set up by the Nazis in Germany during the second world war to hold and torture political opponents as well as millions of Jews, Romanis, Serbs, Poles and disabled people. In this entire fiasco, it must be remembered that this comparison was drawn by Shehla Rashid while sharing a news article that spoke about an individual dying of old-age related issues. One has to wonder why Shehla would take the news of a natural death and spin it in a manner that enables her to call mere detention camps and concentration camps indicating that he died of “torture by state”. Such casual usage of one of the worst crimes against humanity in the 20th century made many people question her trivialising the Holocaust. Karan Bhasin, researcher and LSE (London School of Economics) alumnus, asked her if she knew what a ‘Concentration camp’ is. To that, Rashid lost her cool and evaded answering his question by calling him a ‘supporter of the genocidal BJP lynching regime’. Bhasin replied how his political views or ideologies are unrelated to his academic assessment and again asked Rashid to provide some proof of ‘genocide’, a term many people use rather casually to refer to the 2002 riots which took place following the Godhra carnage where 59 people were burnt alive inside a train while they were returning from Ayodhya. Seeing that she is losing the argument, Rashid took a dig on Bhasin’s educational qualifications and said that he couldn’t write economics essays and support ‘genocide’ at the same time. This, while Bhasin has nowhere claimed he supports genocide. When he again asked her to provide some evidence to the tall claim she was making, Rashid went on to label  him a ‘white collar Nazi’ who ‘supports genocidal regime back home’. In spite of that, Bhasin kept his cool while Rashid continued with the rhetorics. What is unfortunate to note here is the casual use of terms like ‘genocide’ and ‘concentration camps’, thereby trivialising the atrocities and human rights violations carried out by Nazi Germany by comparing it to NRC (National Register for Citizens ) and detention centres to Holocaust and concentration camps. What is more disturbing is that rather than countering with facts, Rashid resorts to name calling and labelling and accusing Bhasin of elitism just because he asked her a question in English, especially when she herself was tweeting in English. She dismisses his questions, where all he asked was evidence for the serious allegations she is making, just because he studied abroad. It is indeed true when you are losing an argument, grace is the first thing that gets kicked out of the window.",2018-10-22,"Assam,Fascism,JNU,National Registry for Citizenship,neo-nazis,NRC,shehla rashid,Twitter,Twitter India","‘Angrezi jeb me rakho’, JNU PhD scholar’s definition of ‘concentration camp’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/angrezi-jeb-me-rakho-jnu-phd-scholars-definition-of-concentration-camp/

In its place, we want to see an alternative government which is progressive, respects freedom of individuals, doesn’t indulge in tax terrorism, gives protection to women and children, and uplifts farmers,” Chidambaram said. This comes days after another senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid expressed doubts  on Congress’ ability to win the 2019 elections on its own. “It is difficult for the party to come to power on its own in the present situation, but opposition alliance must not be formed at the “cost of containing Congress”. The allies should also be ready to make sacrifices and adjustments for defeating the BJP in the 2019 general elections”, Khurshid had said. Both Salman Khurshid and Chidambaram emphasized the need for stitching strong coalition parties. Chidambaram accused BJP of employing “threatening tactics” to keep the coalition of regional parties and Congress at bay. Interestingly, earlier this month Congress President Rahul Gandhi had expressed willingness to become Prime Minister , “if allies want.” However, his expression of ambitions of becoming PM came as a contradiction of his earlier statement in London, where he had downplayed possibilities of becoming PM. Rahul Gandhi’s ambitions can put Congress’ aim of forging a Mahagathbandhan at stake. Not only Congress leaders, but other opposition party leaders like NCP Supremo  Sharad Pawar, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee , and RJD  have also expressed apprehensions about alleviating Gandhi scion to coalition head and later to Prime Minister. As far as present scenario regarding coalition is concerned, Congress has been receiving snubs from parties like BSP and SP, in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and MP elections where they are fielding candidates on their own, without a coalition with Congress.",2018-10-22,"2019 elections,2019 general elections,Congress,mahagathbandhan,Mamata Banerjee,Opposition Party,P Chidambaram,rahul gandhi,Salman Khurshid,Sharad Pawar,United Opposition",Rahul Gandhi won’t be projected as PM candidate in 2019 elections: P Chidambaram,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/rahul-gandhi-wont-be-projected-as-pm-candidate-in-2019-elections-p-chidambaram/
338,Jhankar Mohta,"The Home Ministry had also warned the Kerala government that Left Wing Extremist groups might try to foment violence at Sabarimala, a warning that was clearly ignored by the Communist government.  The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which is an autonomous body managing over 1200 temples including the Lord Ayyappa Temple faces predicaments amidst the mounting protest following the controversial judgement  of the Supreme Court allowing  women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala temple. Owing to the ongoing protests, the footfall that the temple has seen for decades has gone down considerably. Now, there seems to be a decline in the total revenue collection of the shrine, which was already deeply affected  due to lower footfalls as a result of the ongoing agitation. Sources within TDB have told   Instead of money, the former TDB president urged devotees to deposit paper pieces with the writing ‘Swami Saranam’ in the offering boxes. TDB officials claimed  that several temples offering boxes were jammed with pieces of paper. “It is almost sure that the revenue at Sabarimala would see a drop owing to the protests. The campaign has affected revenue at other temples as well,” they said. Other Devaswom Boards in the state along with TDB, irked with this decision are also devising strategies to counter the campaign to avoid monetary offerings to temples. While the Cochin Devaswom Board president M K Sudarsan said the current “false campaign” was a continuation of the Sangh Pariwar’s malicious propaganda to defame the Devaswom Boards, the Malabar Devaswom Board president O K Vasu claimed that if ‘no-donation’ campaign succeeds, it would be the fourth setback to the Malabar Devaswom Board in a row. The other three factors affecting the decline in the revenue being demonetisation, Nipah and floods. “We will not allow the campaign to gain momentum. I will lead the campaign against the Sangh Parivar-backed move to decrease the Board’s revenue,” he said. The Nipah scare and the recent floods severely affected the revenue of MDB temples, Vasu said. “There was a drop of five lakh muttaravu vazhipadu (an offering) at the Kadampuzha temple alone,” he added. However, the devotees of Lord Ayyappa have made themselves rather clear, first with the protests and now the refusal to donate to temples, that they will not stand for their traditions being desecrated. The thousands of devotees protesting have been at the receiving end of police brutality  as well, however, they have maintained their stand firmly. Today, the Communist government of Kerala has also reportedly decided  to send journalists away and cut communication from Sabarimala. This has fuelled speculation that the Kerala government might be planning something untoward on the last day of the Sabarimala temple being open.

Fearing that his ‘peacemaking efforts’ may be rebuffed by India with the 2019 elections because of ‘anti-Pakistan rhetoric’, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said  that he will resume peace talks with India after the elections are over. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative Forum also known as “Davos in the desert” in Riyadh, Khan said , “Pakistan wants peace with all our neighbours particularly India and Afghanistan for regional peace and stability”. Explaining how peaceful relations would help India and Pakistan, Khan said, “Peace with India would help the two countries to divert their resources towards human development instead of indulging in the arms race. Similarly, peace in Afghanistan would help Pakistan to have an easy access to the Central Asian states for bilateral economic and trade activities”. In September, India called off  the meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, planned for the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly the same month, to protest against the killing of security personnel in Kashmir and a Pakistani postage stamp that was “glorifying” a terrorist. However, Khan’s statements raised eyebrows as after the recent bonhomie between Congress and Pakistan. That is not it. Congress ministers on many occasions in the past have praised Pakistan. Pakistanis have also on one occasion reverted  back by praising Congress President Rahul Gandhi for slamming PM Modi. Not to forget how senior Congress leader, Mani Shankar Aiyar while expressing his love for Pakistan, had blamed  India for stopping the dialogue between the two nations. He also went on to say in an interview that to start a dialogue between to nations, Prime Minister Modi needs to be removed  from his post. Former Union Minister of External Affairs, Salman Khurshid, too, on his visit  to Pakistan, had hailed Pakistan as a democratic country and slammed Modi government. Congress, on its part, also seems to be having a soft corner for the neighbour. Recently, Congress was found promoting  a ‘Modi hatao desh bachao’ ad on Facebook in Pakistan. When Congress was called out on the same, the party decided to blatantly lie  after quietly deleting the post.

340,Raju Das,"Sidhu says only Railways is responsible for the tragedy, but evidence shows negligence on the part of organisers After the horrific tragedy in Amritsar where 62 people were killed by a train while they were standing on railway track witnessing the burning of the effigy of Ravan, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu are facing  the ire of victims. Navjot Kaur was the chief guest at the event, and it is alleged that she escaped from the scene just after the incident. Moreover, the organiser of the event was Saurabh Madaan Mitthu, son of local congress councillor Vijay Madaan who reportedly belongs to the Sidhu camp. To deflect the blame, Sidhu is trying to put the entire blame of the incident on Railways. Yesterday, he has questioned why the driver of the train was given clean chit by Railways so soon. Today, he has come up with another statement, alleging that authorities are trying to shield the driver and his name is not being revealed. He also said that Railway engine, police, guards, track belong to centre, implying that centre is to blame for the incident and organisers and state govt is not responsible. He also asked how is it possible that the guards didn’t see the approaching train. But the allegations made by Sidhu are not true. It is false that the identity of the driver has not been revealed. On 21 Going by the video of the incident, it was clear that people were standing on railway tracks, and organisers didn’t take any effort in removing them from there. In fact, the organisers were seen encouraging  people to stand on the tracks, as one sycophant speaker was heard saying that even if 500 trains pass by, 5000 people will keep standing on the tracks to listen to Navjot Kaur Sidhu. It is a known fact that trains need quite a distance to stop, they can’t be stopped in few meters like cars. It was also reported  that the organisers of the event didn’t inform railways about the event, therefore there was no restriction on movement of trains on those tracks. The driver in his statement says that suddenly he saw people on track and applied the emergency brake, but the train didn’t stop immediately. It took some time for the train to stop, and it was too late by then. After that when the train had almost come to a halt, people started pelting stones at the train. To protect the passengers, he decided to not stop and proceeded to Amritsar station. To say that someone from Railway should have seen people on the track and stop the train is nothing but an attempt to avoid taking responsibility. When such a large gathering has taken near an active railway track, and when people are standing on the tracks, it was the responsibility of the organisers to request them to move away from tracks, and inform the railway authorities. Instead, they encouraged people to keep standing on tracks, and now trying to put the entire blame on the driver who was driving the train as per signals on the signalling system. We are not sure what Sidhu means by guards, the guard of a train is stationed at the last coach of the train, or at the guard van that is attached at the end of the train, and there is no way the guard could have seen the people on track.",2018-10-22,"amritsar,Amritsar Train tragedy,Congress,Congress lies,Lies of Congress,navjot singh sidhu,train accident","Congress’ Navjot Singh Sidhu tries to deflect blame, lies about driver of train involved in Amritsar Tragedy",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/congress-navjot-singh-sidhu-tries-to-deflect-blame-lies-about-driver-of-train-involved-in-amritsar-tragedy/

Over 60 people were killed and many others were injured when the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU ran over people gathered to watch Ravan Dahan near the Jora Phatak area in Amritsar. It was a tragedy of mammoth proportions which was completely unavoidable if the organisers had paid attention. If would have also been avoidable had Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu’s wife had paid attention when the person standing next to her boasted  that even if several trains pass, people will still wait on the tracks to greet her.

343,OpIndia Staff,"Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid feels that it is difficult for Congress to come to power in 2019 Lok Sabha Elections on its own as reported  by Indian Express. “It is difficult for the party to come to power on its own in the present situation, but opposition alliance must not be formed at the “cost of containing Congress”. The allies should also be ready to make sacrifices and adjustments for defeating the BJP in the 2019 general elections”, he told PTI in an interview. Expressing the keenness of his party to form an alliance against the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Khurshid said, “All our leaders have made it very clear that an alliance (is needed) to change the country’s government. BJP must go. Whatever it takes to sacrifice, adjust and negotiate to make the alliance a reality, Congress is willing to do. But it is only fair that it should be the same attitude of other (opposition) parties.” Talking about the possibility of Congress coming to power on its own he said, “It is obviously difficult today. If that is the objective (majority on its own) then we will have to work over a period of five years. Because you cannot work towards an alliance for three years and then suddenly say we will fight to win (on our own). You have to fight for five years. Today we are committed to the alliance and we will do our very best to ensure that the alliance succeed”. While making a comparison between Congress and the other parties of grand alliance, he said, “Congress is the only party that gets seats from all over the country and all other (opposition) parties get seats from their respective states”. “Now the elasticity in numbers is much greater when you are talking of seats from all over the country and when you are talking of seats only from your state. This is the practical reality with which all the leaders have to deal with an open mind,” he added. Forming a grand alliance does not appear to be easy as it seems right now. BSP Chief Mayawati has decided  to go alone in the upcoming assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Samajwadi Party has also decided not to forge an alliance with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, blaming it of being non-committal for too long. Reminding the opposition parties of the objective of the grand alliance Khurshid said, “the objective of the grand alliance is to defeat the Modi government. If the participants of the grand alliance forget this objective, then obviously it won’t happen and it will be a loss for every party and the country”. Khurshid expressed hope of getting BSP back in fold saying that the issues in the assembly polls are different from those of the Lok Sabha polls. “Once these five state elections give us some indications of what the public mood is, tying up the grand alliance may become easier,” he said. Regarding the issue of the post of Prime Minister Khurshid said, “the post of prime minister won’t be an issue in forging the grand alliance when opposition leaders have clearly said that the issue will be decided once the alliance win the election. I think those who are raising this issue (prime ministership) do not want us to succeed against the BJP.” Khurshid showered praises on his party President Rahul Gandhi for “infusing fresh energy Dismissing BJP’s claim that the opposition alliance did not have a leader Khurshid said that there were “leaders in the opposition alliance” along with four to five strong regional parties and that the “Congress even in its weak form is strong across the country”. Criticizing the foreign policy of Modi government he said, “the Modi government had failed to build upon on what they had got from the previous governments and nothing much to show in terms of accomplishments”.

344,Raju Das,"Our analysis suggests that the ICICI Bank account number mentioned by Rahul Gandhi does not exist Continuing his attack on BJP leadership, on 22 October Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Arun Jaitley’s daughter was on the payroll of Mehul Choksi, the businessman currently on run after committing fraud. He also alleged that the Finance Minister’s daughter had received money from ICICI Bank account number 12170500316. Rahul Gandhi has also alleged that the legal firm of Sonali Jaitley and her husband Jaish Bakshi had received ₹24 lakh from Gitanjali Gems, the firm of Mehul Choksi, and that they returned the money on February 20, after Mehul fled the country. Although only Sonali Jaitley and Jaish Bakshi can confirm or deny the allegations, we have tried to do a fact on these claims based on one limited piece of information, the account number from where money was allegedly transferred to Sonali Jaitley’s farm. Rahul Gandhi mentions that account number is 12170500316 and it is an ICICI Bank account, which has 11 digits. But ICICI Bank accounts have  12 digits. So, this ‘account number’ fails the first verification test. Next, we tried adding this number as a beneficiary on our ICICI Bank account, for this we did it in two steps, one using the 11-digit number, and then adding a zero at the beginning so that it becomes a valid 12-digit account number of ICICI Bank. Unfortunately, our both attempts resulted in failure, and the banking app gave the error message “Sorry. Your transaction could not be processed. Please try again (#0084)”. This means that either the account number does not exist, or it has been closed. As the error message is not clear, it can’t be determined what is the actual reason. So, the result is undecided in this check, although it is certain that at present this account number does not exist. Next, we tried to analyse the account number more closely. We know that for many banks in India including ICICI, the first 4 digits of a bank account number indicate the code of the branch where that account was opened. Taking 12170500316 as the account number, we get the branch code 1217, and IFSC code ICIC0001217, which gives us Bharat Diamond Bosure Branch in Mumbai. But in this case, the account number will be wrong, as it can’t be 11-digit long. If make it a valid account number and make it 012170500316, the branch code becomes 0121 and IFSC code becomes ICIC0000121, but that is an invalid IFSC code, there is no such ICICI Bank branch with this code. Therefore, in this test with branch code, both versions of the account number fail. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the account number is wrong, or maybe the Congress president has made a typo while writing the number. This is not the first time that allegations of links between Choksi and daughter of Arun Jaitley have been made. In March this year, OpIndia  had reported that the leftist propaganda website ‘The Wire’ was going to publish this as a ‘proof’ of some wrongdoing by Arun Jaitley. Following this, when the website published the story, they concluded  that “The Wire’s initial conclusion was that there wasn’t much of a story after all.” Even though Bakshi had confirmed to The Wire that indeed they had received the money from Gitanjali Gems, and they returned it after a couple of months, the publication had concluded that there was no hint of any corruption in this transaction. It is interesting to note that while a website like The Wire concluded that there was no story in it and didn’t pursue the matter further, Rahul Gandhi is still making those allegations. And that time also, Rahul Gandhi had made the same allegation , linking the same article by The Wire. It seems the Congress President is taking a leaf out of Arvind Kejriwal’s book of making allegations. A couple of years ago, the AAP leader had published alleged  Swiss bank account numbers of Anil Ambani and Mukesh Ambani. The Ambanis had rejected those claims and said that they didn’t have any account with those numbers. The numbers provided by Arvind Kejriwal were 10-digit long, while the International Bank Account Number that banks in Switzerland use are 21 character long alphanumeric codes, and the account  number itself is 12 digit-long.",2018-10-22,"Arun Jaitley,bank account,Gitanjali gems,mehul choksi,rahul gandhi",Did Rahul Gandhi make another gaffe while ‘exposing’ Jaitley based on a debunked hitjob?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/did-rahul-gandhi-make-another-gaffe-while-exposing-jaitley-based-on-a-debunked-news/

The new name of the AAP’s probable Lok Sabha candidate for East Delhi Constituency is Atishi Singh. In August this year, AAP leader Atishi Marlena had dropped  her last name ‘Marlena’ from her name. It was alleged that the name was dropped because it was ‘Christian sounding’, which may not be suitable in her campaign during Lok Sabha elections. The party had denied the allegations, saying that her real surname was Singh and the Marlena surname was given by her parents, which is a combination of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Subsequent to this change, the party poster carried only her first name Atishi, and she had changed her Twitter handle from @Atishimarlena to @AtishiAAP . The name was also changed in all party records and campaigning materials and on the AAP website. At that time, Atishi had said, “My actual surname is Singh and I come from a Punjabi Rajput family. Had I wanted to appease voters then I would have gladly used my real surname.” One AAP leader had said  that BJP was trying to project her as foreigner and Christian, and the party didn’t want to waste time and effort in clarifying this allegation, that’s why the decision to drop the Marlena surname was taken.

In a rather suspicious act, the Communist government of Kerala through its state police have informed media present around the temple and also at Pamba to vacate the area as police officers claim that there are inputs of an attack being planned on the media, reported  ANI. The recent diktat by the Kerala government has disturbed the devotees of Sabarimala, as they see a well-planned plot by the Kerala government to use such orders to ask media to leave the premises and then use the brutal police force to remove the devotees from the shrine to allow few women enter the Sabarimala shrine on the last day. According to some devotees, the Kerala government may use huge force to evict devotees present near the temple by depicting that they were creating violence against the state. With directing the media to stay away from the shrine, the Pinarayi Vijayan government may get a free hand in using police force to target the devotees. It is also feared that, if at all some media organisations decide to stay back, there might be concerted efforts to target the media personnel so that the government can claim that there was an attack on media and can use force against protesters. K Surendran, General Secretary of Kerala BJP said  that they have a clear evidence that Kerala Government is secretly putting in efforts to violate the traditions of Holy Sabarimala. “We personally witnessed Journalists leaving by tractor from Sabarimala. Police have also decided to suspend Internet and Mobile connectivity in Sabarimala. This is a clear indication of the Governments intent to push entry of women on the last day before the sacred temple closes for the month”. Interestingly, journalists of some media organisations seemed happy to leave the premises as soon as Government demanded, who usually restrain from obliging to such diktats, said Surendran. “We have no clue despite serious exploration as to who threatened them and what was the threat? Is the Government intends to turn Sabarimala into a battlefield and shed blood there? We hereby warn that Government that this is a very dangerous game and they are playing with fire”. Some Devotees of Lord Ayyappa see a large conspiracy of the Kerala government to not only create chaos near the shrine but also discredit and insult Hindus by depicting them in a bad manner. Few others believe that Kerala government may block the mobile services and ask the devotees to leave so that the government can allow a group of women including Rehana Fatima to enter the temple The alleged controversy around Sabarimala shrine comes after the Supreme Court in its recent judgement had ordered  Sabarimala Shrine to open its doors to women of all ages, repealing the age-old tradition to not let women of a reproductive age of 10-50 enter the Sabarimala shrine.",2018-10-22,"anti hindu,gods,hindu customs,kerala government,Left propaganda,Pinarayi Vijayan,Sabarimala,SabarimalaVerdict,supreme court,tradition","Kerala: Communist govt asks journalists to leave Sabarimala, devotees see conspiracy to desecrate temple",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/kerala-communist-govt-asks-journalists-to-leave-sabarimala-devotees-see-conspiracy-to-desecrate-temple/

No one wants us to develop but despite all this enmity, our community is making progress.” He went on to say, “Wherever our community makes progress, violence is deliberately instigated to destroy our economy. All this is the work of the Brahmin lobby and in the game they play, we are merely pawns. They are Knights, they are Bishops. And we are pawns. And how could pawns ever compete?” In an interesting advice to the Muslim community, Zaheerudin urged the community to not take to the streets and campaign against the BJP in large numbers as it then leads to Hindu consolidation in favour of the BJP. Instead, he advised, they should do whatever’s necessary on the last day. “If you go outside wearing skull caps and lungis to campaign for the Congress, 80% of the Hindus consolidate after getting the impression that Muslims want the Congress to win.” Zaheeruddin also asserted that Muslims need to plan for the next 20 years. According to him, no political party truly cares about the welfare of Muslims but the ‘small devil’ is better than the ‘big devil’. Emphasizing on the importance of the 2019 General Elections, he said that if BJP wins 2019 elections, India will no more remain a democracy. “If we commit a mistake in 2019, then our future generations will not forgive us”, he added.",2018-10-21,"2019 general elections,BJP.

349,OpIndia Staff,"Earlier in the day, we had reported  how the official Facebook page of Congress was running a paid promotion of an advertisement that read ‘Modi hatao, Desh Bachao” (remove Modi, save India) in Pakistan. Facebook lets pages select their the country the audience of which one would like to target with their messages. This promotion was specifically targetted at the audience of Pakistan. Soon after, Congress had discontinued the ad targetting Pakistan audience. Embarrassed by the revelations that displayed how Congress was targeting Pakistani audience, Congress, instead of explaining or apologising, decided to brazen it out. The official Twitter handle of Congress, arrogantly terming it “fake news” tweeted a photoshopped image where they mocked the revelations by showing ‘Hogwarts’ etc as the selected target audience. However, as the adage goes, what is once on the internet remains on the internet. OpIndia has a screen recording from when the Facebook ad by Congress targeting Pakistani audience was still live. Twitter user @Being_Humor also published an archive link of the Facebook page. Only live web links can be archived. The archived link of Congress’ Facebook page too clearly proves that the advertisement was indeed run by Congress on their Facebook page. In fact, one can see that in the URL of the archived link, the original Facebook page URL is also included which proves beyond a doubt that Congress had indeed run this advertisement and are now lying about it – http://archive.today/2018.10.18-055728/https://www.facebook.com/pg/IndianNationalCongress/ads/?country=20&ref=page_internal This is not the first that time that Congress or its functionaries have brazened out their embarrassing posts after silently deleting them. Earlier too, after Smriti Irani had mentioned in an interview some obscene tweets by Tehseen Poonawalla, who is Robert Vadra’s relative, about Smriti Irani, Tehseen had quietly deleted those tweets and then lied about never having tweeted them at all. He was caught in the lie  by several people. This is also not the first time that Congress has indulged in undermining  Indian elected Prime Minister in Pakistan for its own petty political gains. Earlier, senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar had also gone to Pakistan and asserted exactly the same thing that the Facebook ad now says. Aiyar had asserted in Pakistan that Pakistan should help Congress party dislodge PM Modi and install Congress back in the seat of power. Congress rhetoric at home and Pakistan’s rhetoric at the UNGA also had eerie similarities  and Pakistan trolls had tried to shield and promote Rahul Gandhi  fervently on Twitter. One can also recall how Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu had gone to Pakistan for Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony and hugged the Pakistan army chief  undermining the thousands of soldiers who are butchered by Pakistan. He had then asserted that he rather visit Pakistan than South India.

350,Jhankar Mohta,"A controversy erupted  in Patna on Wednesday after an RJD leader put up posters  ahead of Dusshera, wherein party’s heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav was likened to ‘Lord Ram’ and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was portrayed as the ten-headed demon king ‘Ravan’. The poster inscribed  with a slogan in Hindi, borrowing a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, reading,  ‘ Besides drawing criticism from the Bihar’s ruling party, JD(U), which is headed by Nitish Kumar, who has been depicted as ‘Ravan’ in the posters, surprisingly, this act also gathered denunciation from the Congress party which is an alliance partner of the RJD. Though in the past Congress leaders have themselves, not left a single opportunity to belittle  the government with their controversial remarks, ironically came out to condemn the act. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president Madan Mohan Jha and campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh told reporters, “ The posters, which were seen across Patna yesterday, were removed this morning. The Lalu Prasad-led RJD later clarified that the posters were not put up to scorn the chief minister but to critique the government in the state. However, the JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad in his loathsome response said that the RJD rule in Bihar was marked by lawlessness. Their disrespect for the state’s chief minister was yet another reflection on its character. Asked whether the JD(U) would like the government to take any legal action against those involved in putting up the posters, Prasad told the media, “ The JD(U) was quick to remind the RJD that it was Nitish Kumar’s face which helped them to increase their tally from 22 to 80 in the 2015 assembly elections. “ However, this was not the only political poster on display during the Durga Puja festivities in Bihar. There were other posters put up by the Congress too, trying to belittle the BJP government. A poster put up by the Congress offering  a ‘reward’ of Rs 5 crore to whoever came up with the names of 35 airports supposedly built during the tenure of prime minister Narendra Modi besides the ‘truth’ of the Rafale deal  was seen at some places in the state capital. In fact, earlier too, the deep-rooted, horrendous, casteist bias of the Congress Party was boldly out in the open when a poster with a group of State leaders of the Congress party along with the party president, Rahul Gandhi, depicting the respective caste groups the leaders belonged to emerged  in Patna. In its retaliation to the ongoing ‘poster war’, the BJP in a quick-witted move had almost immediately displayed  posters, wherein below every individual leader’s picture ‘Bharatiya’ (Indian) was imprinted in bold.

351,OpIndia Staff,"In a stunning confession which may cause huge embarrassment for Congress, Karnataka Minister and party strongman DK Shivakumar openly revealed that the previous Congress government led by Siddaramaiah made a grave mistake by trying to divide people by raking up Veerashaiva-Lingayat issue. The Congress leader admitted that the previous government tried to create a divide among caste groups to further political agenda. According to News18 Kannada , DK Shivakumar visited the Dasara Sammelan of the Rambhapuri Seer Veera Someshwara Shivacharya Swami in Gadag and spoke regarding the stand taken by the previous Congress government on the issue of Veerashaiva-Lingayath. The Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah had taken an extreme step of creating a divide  between Veerashaivas and Lingayats by recommending a separate religion tag to ‘Lingayat’ community ahead of the elections in Karnataka. Veerashaiva or Lingayat is a prominent caste group which controls huge stakes in Karnataka’s electoral politics along with Vokkaligas in the state. Source: Republic TV DK Shivakumar went on to say that political parties should never commit the mistake of indulging in religious politics  and went on to admit that Congress party indulged in dividing people to garner votes in the elections. DK Shivakumar, who was a Power minister in the previous government said that Siddaramaiah led Congress government made a grave error by playing Lingayat card in the state elections. “We have committed a grave mistake during our tenure. Any government at any juncture should not politicise religion or interfere in its matters. There were a lot of political developments happening then but no government must intervene in matters of religion. Recently concluded events have reflected the people’s sentiments on this matter”, said DK Shivakumar. DK Shivakumar went on to apologise for the actions of previous government. ” I will apologise sincerely for making such a grave mistake”, said the Karnataka Minister. Late talking to media about his comment, Shivakumar said that he has made this statement from his heart and it was his personal opinion. He confirmed that he stands by his comment and reiterated that politicians should not interfere in the matter of religion. The Congress despite playing the Veerashaiva-Lingayat card did not garner enough seat to cross simple majority in the state legislature.

352,OpIndia Staff,"After the recent renaming of Prayagraj, few other states have decided to take an initiative to restore the historical names of several cities in the country. The Himachal Pradesh government is now considering  to rename Shimla as ‘Shyamala’ in an attempt to eliminate the “symbols of British rule”, a report said. According to the reports, the demand by some sections to restore the historical names of certain cities to regain the lost glory has been doing rounds recently. The groups like Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad and also Health Minister Vipin Parmar has been pushing the state government to restore  the historical name of ‘Shimla’ after the Uttar Pradesh government decided to rename Allahabad as ‘Prayagraj’. Vipin Parmar said there is no harm in changing the name of Shimla to ‘Shyamala’ The VHP had long demanded the renaming of the city of ‘Shimla’. The former Congress Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had rejected  the demand of the VHP to restore the name of the former British Summer capital-Shimla. “Slavery can either be physical, mental or cultural. Sticking to names given by oppressors is a sign of mental slavery. Changing names of town is a small but significant step. The country had done away with several symbols of British rule after independence, but in Himachal, several names remain of the colonial time,” VHP state president Aman Puri said. Aman Puri further added that the Britishers changed the earlier name of Shyamala to Shimla as they couldn’t pronounce the former. The renaming or restoring of historical names of the cities has gained traction after the recent decision  of the Uttar Pradesh government led by Yogi Adityanath to restore the name of ‘Prayagraj’ ahead of Kumbh Mela in 2019. Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Ram Naik on Saturday approved the renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj with immediate effect. This renaming of the iconic places is not new, as Yogi Adityanath government earlier had renamed  the Mughalsarai station of the Uttar Pradesh as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya junction in an attempt to revive the legacy of one of the greatest leaders of the country.",2018-10-21,"allahabad,british,hills,Himachal Pradesh,History distortion,prayagraj,rename","Himachal Pradesh: Inspired by renaming of ‘Prayagraj’, state government wants to restore name of Shimla to ‘Shyamala’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/himachal-pradesh-inspired-by-renaming-of-prayagraj-state-government-wants-to-restore-name-of-shimla-to-shyamala/
353,Jhankar Mohta,"Sabarimala temple in Kerala turned  into a war zone as it opened its door for women aged between 10 and 50 years on October 17, following the controversial judgement of the Supreme Court allowing women of all ages to enter the temple. As per several media reports, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued  a circular , dated October 16, addressed to Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu warning the governments to make adequate security arrangements at the Sabarimala Temple. The advisory was accessed on Friday, shortly after two women made it within metres of the Sabarimala Temple  in the morning but were forced to return  after an hours-long deliberation between multiple groups. The circular clearly stated  that there should be no breach of law and order on October 17 when Sabarimala Temple in Kerala opened its doors to women of all ages. The circular even cautioned  the state’s about the presence of Left-wing extremist (LWE) groups campaigning in favour of women’s entry into Sabarimala temple. The MHA writing to the top bureaucrats of all three state’s had also warned that many devotees of Lord Ayyappa had planned protests on October 17. The circular read: The Home Ministry in its advisory furthered cautioned that some Hindu outfits might organise protests on October 17 and may organise state-wide protests: “Hindu outfits plan to organise protest programmes on 17.10.2018 against Hon’ble Court’s order at Nilackal village in Pathanamthitta district and Erumeli village in Kottayam districts. Separately, Ayyappa devotees, Hindu outfits and certain caste-based outfits have been organising a state-wide protest against the Hon’ble court’s order. Participation in these protests has ranged from 50-3,000, including participation of a sizeable number of women. Hindu outfits have also organised a few protest programme in neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.” Despite the MHA circular which was sent a day before the temple opened, Sabarimala temple turned into a war zone. Section 144 had to be imposed in parts of Pathanamthitta district where Sabarimala temple is located. This raises questions as to whether due cognisance was taken by the state governments of the warning given by the Home Ministry? In fact, few people on Twitter could also sense the conspiracy contrived by the leftist cabal the MHA had warned three states about, which the state’s clearly ignored. As the communist government lathicharged  and pelted stones at the protesting devotees, questions were raised whether the Communist government of Kerala was more than happy to allow Hindu religious sentiments to be hurt. Rubbing salt in the wound, the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had made a controversial statement  that certain customs are meant to be violated, hinting at the beliefs of the devotees of Lord Ayyappa. What further heightened  the contempt of Hindu sentiments was when Kerala’s Finance Minister and member of Communist Party of India (Marxist) Thomas Isaac took to Twitter to call all protesting devotees of Lord Ayyappa as terrorists. Keeping up with the anti-Hindu stance the Communist government seems to be fostering, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechuri on Friday hit-out  at RSS and said that the pattern of protest is similar to what was during Babri Masjid demolition. Stating that similar thing is being done here (Sabarimala), Yechury said, “It is an organized thing that the RSS is doing. RSS has lost the battle of not letting the gates of Sabarimala open, they even lost the battle that the temple shouldn’t open on time.”",2018-10-20,"anti hindu,communists,CPI M,Home Ministry,kerala government,Leftist,Sabarimala,SabarimalaVerdict,Sitaram yechury,supreme court,Twitter,violence",Sabarimala: HMO had warned Kerala govt about Left Wing Extremist groups instigating violence,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/sabarimala-hmo-had-warned-kerala-govt-about-left-wing-extremist-groups-instigating-violence/
354,Jinit Jain," Hindus for turning away from the Congress party, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad claimed that the number of Hindu brothers inviting him to campaign for them have reduced. In an attempt to stir communal cauldron, Azad also asserted that Hindu candidates fear losing out on votes if he campaigns for them.Blaming Speaking at an event in Lucknow last week to mark the 201st birth anniversary of the Aligarh Muslim University founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, Azad contended that since his days as a youth leader he has been campaigning across the country for a number of party candidates belonging to the Hindu community, but of late the number of Hindu candidates calling him to campaign for them have reduced drastically. “Since the days of the Youth Congress, I have been campaigning across the country from Andaman Nicobar to Lakshadweep. 95% of those who used to call me were Hindu brothers and leaders, and just 5% were Muslim brothers,” he said. Azad, who is essentially blaming Hindus for being so communal that they have stopped inviting him for campaigning, forgets that his party itself, that claims to be the minority messiah has failed to ensure commensurate representation. If we go by the number of Muslim candidates Congress fielded in 2017 Gujarat elections, it was just paltry 5 out of the 182 seats  that went to the polls. That is approximately 2.7% of candidates were Muslims. If we consider Uttar Pradesh, Congress and Samajwadi party together fielded just 80 Muslim candidates  (18 by Congress, 62 by SP) out of 404 seats that went to the polls in 2017. That is roughly 19% of candidates were Muslims. The remaining 81% were overwhelmingly Hindus. Even in their heydays of Muslim appeasement, in 2012,  Congress could only send 3 MLAs  to the Vidhan Sabha when the UP state saw one of the highest representation of Muslims in the state assembly-63 since the independence. It is interesting that first, the party that claims to be the harbingers of minority rights, has fielded paltry Muslim candidates, to begin with. Secondly, instead of calling Hindus ‘communal’, perhaps it is necessary for the party and for Azad, who is a mentor to Rahul Gandhi to realise why Hindus have stopped trusting Congress. Eminent Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has claimed  that no ‘good Hindu’ would want a Ram Mandir at Babri site. Another senior Congress leader, Kapil Sibal, pleaded the SC to defer the decision on Ram Temple  in Ayodhya till 2019 elections, insinuating that the decision might influence the election outcome. Congress leaders routinely indulge in appeasement  politics, shaming Hindu festivals and Hindu Gods. Recently, Narendra Modi slammed  Congress for attacking artwork of Lord Hanuman. With this appalling blame on Hindus, Azad also made a tacit approval of waning popularity of the Congress party among Hindus. Azad asserted that fewer candidates invite him as Hindu candidates fear losing out on votes if he campaigns for them. Hindus may have realised the nefarious designs employed by the Congress party to woo them during the election seasons, like organizing Rahul Gandhi’s temple runs  in the run-up to elections and appeasing minorities once the elections are over, like supporting  Sharia courts. Ghulam Nabi Azad himself has given controversial statements in the past. Pakistan based terror outfit LeT echoed  Azad’s views on Kashmir. He also insulted  the Army by claiming that it killed more civilians than terrorists did. Just before Karnataka went to the polls, Azad made a clarion call  to all Muslims of the state to vote for Congress. Perhaps Azad fails to realise that it was Congress that moved heaven and earth to concoct the “Saffron Terror”  narrative by falsely implicating Sadhvi Pragya and even Lt Col Purohit. It was Congress which wanted to pass the Communal Violence Bill  which basically ensured that only Hindus would be considered perpetrators and never a Muslim, should there be any communal violence. The bill was formed by people who were associated with various foreign-funded NGOs . It was Rahul Gandhi who deemed  mythical “saffron terror” more dangerous than LeT. It was P Chidambaram and Sushil Kumar Shinde who called Hindus terrorists with no proof or reason . It was Manmohan Singh who said Muslims have the first right on our country’s resources. It was Congress that divided Hindus  by giving Lingayats the separate religion tag. It was Congress’ stand that was supported by Hafiz Saeed . It was Congress that ran a ‘Modi hatao desh bachao’ Facebook campaign in Pakistan  and it was Congress whose leaders went to Pakistan and derided India. The list of Congress’ treachery with respect to Hindus is rather endless. Against such a dreary backdrop, why would any self-respecting Hindu rally behind the Congress party? It is almost as if the Congress expects the Hindus to ask if the Hindu’s back hurt the Congress’ knife. Azad needs to realise that it is not because a ‘Muslim’ campaigns that Hindus don’t wish to vote for Congress, but because Congress has historically betrayed Hindus and now, they just refuse to take it lying down.",2018-10-21,"Anti-Hindu Congress,communal violence bill,Congress,Congress against Hindus,Congress blames Hindus,Congress lies,Ghulam Nabi Azad,manmohan singh,rahul gandhi,sonia gandhi",It is almost as if the Congress expects Hindus to ask if the Hindu’s back hurt the Congress’ knife,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/it-is-almost-as-if-the-congress-expects-hindus-to-ask-if-the-hindus-back-hurt-the-congress-knife/

Many had asserted that the Communist government of Kerala was perhaps more than happy to allow Hindu religious sentiments to be hurt. Adding insult to injury, yesterday, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had made a controversial statement  that certain customs are meant to be violated, hinting at the beliefs of the devotees of Lord Ayyappa. The insults heaped upon Hindus by the Communist government didn’t stop there. Now, Kerala’s Finance Minister and member of Communist Party of India (Marxist) Thomas Isaac has taken to Twitter to call all protesting devotees of Lord Ayyappa as terrorists. This comment came after Republic TV’s coverage of the Sabarimala protests which was skewed heavily against the devotees. In his tweet, Isaac is amused that Arnab Goswami is angry for the right reason “which is a rarity”. Thomas Isaac then proceeded to draw a ludicrous comparison. He asserted that none of Republic TV’s journalists were attacked when Arnab Goswami called the state a “Terrorist/IS hub “. “But now that you happen to be on the opposite side of real terrorists, you got it”, he added referring to the protesting devotees as terrorists. Last year in August, the Communists in Kerala, in a targeted cyber attack , had tried to downvote Republic TV on Facebook because Republic TV had perhaps reported something which had offended the Leftists in Kerala. Earlier, the Kerala CM had made another controversial statement, saying “if faith is above Constitution and law, why not have a temple in Ayodhya”. He has also accused  that the attacks on journalists by protesters are RSS agenda. However, it is unclear why the communist leader, who’s also state minister, termed protestor as terrorists.

Claiming that the unrestricted availability and consumption was leading to several social as well as law and order problems in the state, the BJP proposed that the sale of liquor will be restricted to only five days a week. “Alcohol addiction is wrecking many households in Telangana. It is also the main cause for marital discord, robberies, sexual assaults, suicides, and brawls. We will totally regulate the sale of liquor in the state if we come to power.

The consumption of liquor has been leading to several atrocities against women in Telangana, along with suicides and several other law and order issues. The sale of liquor would be restricted to 5 days a week, with fixed timings to be maintained by liquor stores. “After 6pm, no wine shop or bar will be open. There will be a total ban on liquor during weekends,” he added. The manifesto  also promises cancellation of surcharge fares by state-run Road Transport Corporation (RTC) buses during festival seasons and free transportation to those taking up ‘Deeksha’ (religious code of behaviour) for visiting temples, including Sabarimala. Furthermore, a total waiver of taxes on petrol and diesel is promised which may lower the price of fuel by Rs. 20 The BJP also plans to constitute a task force to protect lands belonging to religious places like temples, waqf and churches in the state. Prabhakar added that no other party had been sensitive to this particular issue so far but “we will protect lands of religious institutions from encroachment,’’ he said. Several more proposals  by the BJP manifesto include free online and offline coaching for youth who appear for competitive exams and the provision of safe drinking water for Rs. 6 per month per household. “The provision of such minimum facilities should not be viewed like a profit-loss proposition. They should be seen as a source of income,” Prabhakar asserted.

360,OpIndia Staff,"After the Cambridge Analytica fiasco  where it was alleged that user data of millions of Facebook users had been compromised and used for targeting political campaigning, in which the Congress party was also named , the social networking website has greatly increased its transparency protocol. Now, when a Facebook page pays money to promote a post and run it as an advertisement to target its audience with their messaging, Facebook provides people with the option of viewing which ads are being run by the page to target which audience. When one looks at any Facebook page and clicks on the “Info and ads” tab, all the paid promotions that are being run by the party’s page are displayed. For example, when we looked at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s official Facebook page, it displayed only one paid promotion which is being seeded by BJP. The BJP is running a simple page promotion in India. We know it is being seeded in India because of the disclaimer displayed by Facebook that reads “You’re seeing ads that BJP is currently running in your location. They aren’t running ads in any other country”. Since we checked the page from India, the obvious conclusion is that BJP is running just the one promotion targeted at an audience within India. However, when we checked the official Facebook page of the Congress party, we were in for a surprise. When one checks the “Info and ads” tab of Congress’ Facebook page, one sees multiple promotions being run. Firstly, the page gives you an option to choose between India and Pakistan as the location the ads are being promoted in. When one selects India, one sees 4 promotions being run. However, when one changes the option to ‘Pakistan’, one sees a single paid promotion being run with the targeted audience being Pakistan. As evidenced, Rahul Gandhi led Indian National Congress seems to be running a paid promotion through Facebook, in Pakistan, of a post that urges people to “desh bachao, Modi hatao” (Remove Modi, save the Nation). This was first brought to the fore by a YouTube channel that goes by the name “An Open Letter “. This is not the first time that Congress has indulged in undermining  Indian elected Prime Minister in Pakistan for its own petty political gains. Earlier, senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar had also gone to Pakistan and asserted exactly the same thing that the Facebook ad now says. Aiyar had asserted in Pakistan that Pakistan should help Congress party dislodge PM Modi and install Congress back in the seat of power. Congress rhetoric at home and Pakistan’s rhetoric at the UNGA also had eerie similarities  and Pakistan trolls had tried to shield and promote Rahul Gandhi  fervently on Twitter. One can also recall how Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu had gone to Pakistan for Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony and hugged the Pakistan army chief  undermining the thousands of soldiers who are butchered by Pakistan. He had then asserted that he rather visit Pakistan than South India.

Lauding the efforts taken by the government to increase the internal security, he said, the cohorts of anti-nationals have already been formed in the mainstream media, social media as well as in the intellectuals circles. He added that this manufacturing of vicious environment weakens the cohesiveness and a world of psychological warfare is carved out.

362,OpIndia Staff,"Amidst the recent episode of widespread violence which consumed Gujarat, which was reportedly instigated  by Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor and his aides, the party appears  to have distanced itself from the leader. In a function scheduled on 21st October in Bihar to mark the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna Singh, the state’s first chief minister, all top leaders of the party are invited. In what appears like an internal rift  within the party, Congress has not invited Thakor, who is also the secretary in-charge for Bihar. When asked about the possibility of Thakor attending the function, Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha and BPCC campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh said “After being appointed the AICC secretary in-charge of the state, he has visited Bihar only once. As far as we know, no invitation has been sent to him”. The Congress leaders, however, did not specify if keeping Thakor away was a conscious decision taken in view of the resentment among Biharis against the assault on migrant workers in Gujarat for which the Kshatriya Thakor Sena, run by the MLA has been accused . Instead, Jha and Singh, in an attempt to shroud the Congress’ decision tried to turn around the argument by blaming the BJP for the recent clashes in Gujarat. “It is the BJP government in Gujarat which is responsible for the violence against people from the Hindi belt.

In a series of tweets, Puri said, that owing to the lack of support from Delhi government, in October 2017 it was decided that the remaining 20% of the funding for the skywalk would be provided by the DDA (Delhi Development Authority, which is under the central government). He added that the state PWD (public works department) would execute the job and then raise a bill to DDA. This way, while the money will show as an expenditure in the state government’s books, the Delhi government would actually be claiming it all back from DDA. Such reimbursement will not take place in cases where the state PWD is not the executing body. Puri then brought out other projects which have hit a roadblock owing to the Delhi government. The skywalk, fully funded  by the Centre at the cost of Rs. 54.85 crore, was inaugurated on Monday. On a review undertaken in October 2017 in the Ministry in view of the slow progress in these projects, it was decided that the projects where balance funding of 20% of the project cost was not forthcoming from the Delhi government, the same may be funded by the DDA/ITPO i.e., 100% funding by the Central Government.

369,K Bhattacharjee,"In the mainstream narrative, authentic Hindu intellectuals hardly ever find a space. Instead of scholars who can present the Hindu view of things with eloquence and panache, we are left to ponder upon the words and work of people who should not even be a part of the civil discussion. Of course, it is part of a larger concerted attempt to discredit Hindu scholars and give the impression to laymen that the Hindu side does not have any person capable of debating Marxist intellectuals. One such Hindu scholar who never quite received the recognition during his own life which he so thoroughly deserved was Sita Ram Goel. A devout Hindu, a true pagan at heart who recognized acutely the intolerance and radicalism that envelops every aspect of monotheistic culture, Goel’s work along with his friend Ram Swarup’s forms one of the cornerstones of an intellectual defence of Hindu Nationalism. It is a testament to his capabilities that it will be extremely difficult if not entirely impossible to find a single Hindutva supporter on social media today, and especially among the youth, who has not been influenced one way or the other by the works of the great Goel. “Hindu Temples- What happened to them” perhaps remains Goel’s best-known work. In the book, he documented, with his co-authors such as Arun Shourie and Ram Swarup, the catastrophic damage that was inflicted on the Hindu civilization and its Temples by the Muslim invaders. Then there was his book ‘Hindu Society Under Siege’ where he writes , “Thus Hindu society not only presents itself as a prey to these exclusive, intolerant and imperialist ideologies but also acts as a buffer between them. India is secular because India is Hindu. It can be added as a corollary that India is a democracy also because India is Hindu. If Hindu society permits this free for all any further, the days of Secularism and Democracy in this country are numbered. Let the Hindus unite and save themselves, their democratic polity, their secular state, and their Sanatana Dharma for a new cycle of civilization, not only for themselves but also the world.” Goel was particularly sharp in his criticism of Christian missionaries. He wrote  of them in his book, Catholic Ashrams, “Fundamentalism is as foreign to Hinduism as honesty is to Christian missions.” True to his pagan roots, Goel was critical of both Christianity and Islam. In another book that he co-authored, he wrote, “Ascribing human brotherhood, social justice, world peace, self-sacrifice and compassion to Christianity and Islam is tantamount to proclaiming that the wolf is a votary of vegetarianism.” One work of his that deserves special mention here is The Calcutta Quran Petition . Those unaware, the petition was a rare instance when a Hindu sought to use the state machinery of the country to achieve an ideological objective. The petition demanded that the Quran be banned citing the violence it advocates in its pages. The petition was in response to the various occasions when Muslims sought to silence all criticism. As per Goel, “it was the first time that a Pagan had questioned the character of a document hailed as the very Word of God by a People of the Book. The roles now stood reversed. So far it had been the privilege of the Peoples of the Book to ban and burn the sacred literature of the Pagans.” The petition, however, was disallowed by the Calcutta High Court. An acquaintance of mine who has spent most of his childhood and adult life abroad recounted to me the profound impact the book had on him. “My nanaji was responsible for the beginning of my intellectual journey into history, religion, philosophy and the like when I was 16. He showed me two books in his library when I visited him on a particular occasion. I spent the next few days devouring them. One of them was ‘The Calcutta Quran Petition’ by Sita Ram Goel. Reading that book was a really shocking experience for me. It was superbly written with a clearly elucidated story and plot. Reading the reactions of the judiciary, the journalists and the ecosystem to the petition was very revealing. It took me a few days to recover from it, and then I asked my Nanaji for more material, so he handed me all the books from Voice of India that he had. I became a huge fan of Sita Ram Goel and Ram Swarup from then on. I understood the Ram Mandir case, and the destruction of Hindu temples, and the damage inflicted by the Islamic invaders on India. After that, I searched for counterpoints to these books, but none existed anywhere. All I could find were Marxist vitriol and abuse.” Incidentally, Goel was a Communist during his early years and was even on the verge of joining the Communist Party of India. It was only later after he had read books by Aldoux Huxley and others that he abandoned Communism for good. In his autobiography, How I Became a Hindu , Goel wrote that Ram Swarup, who is often fondly referred to as Acharya (mentor/spiritual teacher) by people on social media, was one of his main influences. He wrote of Hinduism in the book, “Sanatana Dharma called upon its votary to explore his own self in the first instance and see for himself the truths expounded in sacred scriptures. Prophets and churches and scriptures could be aids but never the substitutes for self-exploration, self-purification, and self-transcendence.” And then, finally, on his return he writes, “ One of my friends says Goel was his gateway to Hinduism. He tells me, “I first heard of him while searching for a defence of polytheism. He describes polytheism as “The natural expression of an evolved consciousness.” It is quite literally the greatest quote by any human being on why polytheism is so great. It’s how I got into Sanatana Dharma. Even though I have only read one of his books in its entirety.” It’s quite necessary to read the statement by Goel that my friend spoke about in full. It’s from his autobiography previously mentioned. He wrote, “I had an occasion to read the typescript of a book [Ram Swarup] had finished writing in 1973. It was a profound study of Monotheism, the central dogma of both Islam and Christianity, as well as a powerful presentation of what the monotheists denounce as Hindu Polytheism. I had never read anything like it. It was a revelation to me that Monotheism was not a religious concept but an imperialist idea. I must confess that I myself had been inclined towards Monotheism till this time. I had never thought that a multiplicity of Gods was the natural and spontaneous expression of an evolved consciousness.” The inability of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to capitalize on the intellect of Goel’s stature reflects very poorly on the organization. In fact, Goel did contribute articles to the RSS mouthpiece, Organizer, until the organization intervened to have him removed for being too harsh in his critique of Jawaharlal Nehru. As per Koenraad Elst , another noted Hindu scholar, the reasoning was that should Nehru ever be murdered, then the blame would fall on RSS if there was criticism in its pages. In his part, Goel was very critical of the RSS and regarded it to be detrimental to the Hindu society at large. “The RSS is the biggest collection of duffers that ever came together in world history” (1989), “The RSS is leading Hindu society into a trap from which it may not recover” (1994), “Hindu society is doomed unless this RSS-BJP movement perishes” (2003) were some of his words for the organization. Along with Ram Swarup and Arun Shourie, Sita Ram Goel laid the foundations for an intellectual defence of Hindu Dharma. Parallel to and even preceding the Ram Janambhoomi movement, the stalwarts of Hindutva had sown the seeds of an intellectual movement the fruits of which we are only now beginning to see. Goel, Shourie and Ram Swarup especially have become gateways to Hindutva. Anyone who seeks a better understanding of Hindu society and the threat it faces would be well advised to start from their books. During online conversations, Hindus overwhelmingly rely on the works of these stalwarts to strengthen their argument. They have become the go-to source for people to spread the light of Dharma. Although Shourie’s recent actions leave a bitter taste in one’s mouth, the value of his work cannot be negated. Even among the stalwarts of the Hindu renaissance, Sita Ram Goel has earned for himself special recognition. As another friend of mine puts it, “Goel ji succinctly, and without beating around the bush, point blank showed and wrote on saboteurs and subversionist enemies of Hindu Samaj and their historical modes of working. I cannot think f anyone else who did it in a manner so direct and so exhaustive. You cannot read some of the things he wrote and not be moved.” Indeed, Goel’s body of work and life will continue to serve as an inspiration and a source of immense knowledge for those with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. His work may not have received the recognition it deserved during his life but it has inspired many to return to the Dharmic fold and will continue to serve as a beacon for those who may have wandered from the path of righteousness but seek a return.",2018-10-16,"christianity,Hinduism,hindutva,islam,Religion,RSS,Sita Ram Goel",In fond memory of Sita Ram Goel: A pagan warrior in a world of monotheistic fanaticism,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/in-fond-memory-of-sita-ram-goel-a-pagan-warrior-in-a-world-of-monotheistic-fanaticism/

As per reports  the city will be promoted as ‘Prayagraj’ to promote Indian culture on an international scale. In May this year, we had reported  that the UP government led by Yogi Adityanath is considering renaming the city ahead of the Kumbh Mela which will be hosted in the city early next year. Last year, seers from several akharas had met  UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and urged him to restore the ancient name of the city. They had claimed that they were confident that the Mahant of Gorakhnath Muth will accept their demand. Some media reports also claim  that the banners for the upcoming Kumbh Mela mention the city’s name as “Prayagraj”. However, soon after Yogi Adityanath declared that if a consensus is reached to rename Allahabad, his government will change its name to Prayagraj, the Congress on Sunday had come out opposing  his decision. Congress spokesperson Onkar Singh said that Allahabad had a history attached to it, which has played an important role since the days of Independence and renaming the name of the city to Prayagraj by erasing Allahabad would be an insult to the freedom movement. Onkar Singh further added that if the UP government is very much interested in changing the name, then a separate city of ‘Prayagraj’ can be carved out of Allahabad. Renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj will be consistent with Yogi Adityanath’s image as a mascot of Hindutva. He has been known to make comments  which affirm his pride in his Hindu identity without insulting the faith of people from other communities. Earlier this year, Barsana was painted saffron as Yogi Adityanath celebrated  Lathmar Holi there. In another incident, Yogi Adityanath delivered on his poll promise as Hindu families returned  to Kairana after he assumed the seat of Chief Minister. On another occasion, Yogi Adityanath reaffirmed  his faith in the equal treatment of religions and asserted that he has no right to stop Janmashtami processions if he cannot stop Namaz on roads. Furthermore, Mughalsarai railway station was renamed  to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar station.",2018-10-16,"akbar,allahabad,hindutva,mughal period,Mughal Rule of India,Pragyagraj,rename,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath","Uttar Pradesh: Allahabad to now be called Prayagraj, confirms Yogi government",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/uttar-pradesh-allahabad-to-now-be-called-prayagraj-confirms-yogi-government/

372,Nupur J Sharma,"The stories that have tumbled in the #MeToo  movement have been overwhelming, to say the least. The mighty have fallen and how! From the film industry to media, the women have braved being gaslighted and shamed to come out and name their abusers. Among the prominent names to have cropped up as someone who allegedly abused his position of power to make sexual advances has been Union Minister of State, MJ Akbar , who has been accused of sexually exploiting young women when he was a journalist and editor of various media outlets. As reported  by The News Minute, as many as twelve women, have come forward and put on record their stories of sexual harassment by the junior minister. One of the women who has accused Akbar, Shuma Raha, has claimed that Akbar invited her to his hotel room and then later asked her to join her for drinks. She said that he didn’t “do” anything, but had a rattling and deeply uncomfortable experience. Interestingly, in an opinion piece published  today in Congress mouthpiece National Herald, Raha tries to draw everyone’s attention to not “give credence to unsubstantiated rumours and third-hand accounts of victimisation.” She explains how while it is “gratifying” to see “well known sexual predators getting their comeuppance”, one should not forget the blurry distinction between harassment or assault and “creepy, uncomfortable interactions with men who were trying their luck.” In what seems like an afterthought of putting out her allegations, Raha explains how all behaviour by men which make women feel uncomfortable should not really fall under the ‘sexual harassment or assault’. According to Raha, She further argues, Now, my personal views on the stories that have tumbled out against Union Minister MJ Akbar are no secret. I had tweeted when the stories came to the fore that most of the tales are harrowing and that, indeed, action must be taken against him. This article is not about MJ Akbar or the veracity of claims by other women. This is specifically to evaluate what Shuma Raha has said and how her theory digresses with her practice. She argues that while some say that only the women have the right to decide if a particular experience constitutes harassment if we “muddle the apparently non-threatening situations with those that are unquestionably so, we run the risk of diluting the #MeToo movement”. If one applies her logic, one wonders whether she tried to portray an apparently non-threatening situation (since in her own words as shown in the tweet above, she says Akbar didn’t “do” anything) which made her uncomfortable as against the ones which are unquestionably so, did she risk the diluting #MeToo movement? When a woman accuses a man, it is indeed true that it is only the woman who can ascertain whether that act constitutes harassment. There are several circumstantial cues that help a woman ascertain the nature of that exchange even if it doesn’t fall within the strict purview of the law regarding sexual harassment. However, when a woman, in this case Shuma Raha first accuses a man of sexual harassment for ‘not going anything’ but asking her for a drink, and then writes an op-ed asserting that women need to differentiate between when men ‘made them feel uncomfortable’ and when it is ‘sexual harassment’, urging them not to conflate the two, it is obvious for us to ask whether she herself branded an ‘uncomfortable situation’ as ‘sexual harassment’. Going by her logic, if we give credence to her accusations on “this editor”, the movement runs the risk of getting undermined. Since as the logic she gave above, she just had an ‘uncomfortable’ situation which she added to the ‘#MeToo’ movement, which in her own words is “cultural inflexion point when woman after woman breaks her silence and outs a powerful man who subjected her to sexual harassment and exploitation because he felt his position entitled him to do so.” So, I have a few questions for Shuma Raha. Did you feel harassed or assaulted back in 1995 at the hotel in Kolkata or was it a ‘creepy, uncomfortable interaction with a man who was trying his luck’? Does what she claims, fall under the “wild allegations” bit? One has to wonder that whether the fact that she claims Akbar didn’t “do” anything, falls under the grey area which could give a free pass to wild allegations? I am genuinely curious whether the alleged interview or the invitation for drinks that followed, falls under a non-threatening situation since Akbar “didn’t do anything”? I must also ask Raha what torch she bears when she writes for Gandhi family owned National Herald  whose Executive Editor Uttam Sengupta  too was accused of sexual misconduct and the paper chose to remain silent on the same and brazen it out . I believe sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious concern. It breaks a woman’s spirit. It breaks her will to achieve. It just breaks her. I applaud the woman who has spoken out after being victims of genuine harassment. However, a man, when accused falsely loses just as much. Somewhere between radical feminism and radical men’s rights, lies a path of green where justice prevails.",2018-10-16,"allegations,BJP,metoo,mj akbar,Sexual Assault,sexual harassment,workplace harassment",Shuma Ruha’s article in National Herald contradicts her own allegation of sexual harassment,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/shuma-ruhas-article-in-national-herald-contradicts-her-own-allegation-of-sexual-harassment/
373,OpIndia Staff,"Continuing his series of Facebook posts as counter attack Rahul Gandhi’s non-stop allegations, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has posted another article on Facebook. In the post titled “Is the ‘Clown Prince’ out-clowning himself”, the finance minister responds to some of the bizarre claims made by the Congress president in his election rallies in Madhya Pradesh. He starts the post with an advice that many senior criminal advocates give to junior ones, “if you are strong on facts, bang the facts. If you are strong on law, bang the law. If you are weak on both, then bang the desk”, setting the tone of the post. After that, he proceeds on to respond to specific allegations by Rahul Gandhi. Jaitley first takes the allegation of Rahul Gandhi that Anil Ambani’s Reliance has got a huge advantage in the Rafale, the quantum which ranges from ₹38,000 crore to ₹1,30,000 crore and that the job of manufacturing Rafale has been given to Reliance instead of HAL. Responding to this, Jaitley reminds that the Rafale aircraft its weapons are not being made in India at all, they will be completely built in France. He says that as per offset policy formulated by UPA government, Dassault will have to make purchases from India for 50% of contract value. Over 120 Indian companies will get offset business from Dassault and Reliance is just one among them, and Reliance will get only around 3% of the business, which is less than ₹1000 crore. Second, the finance minister clarifies that bad loans declared as NPA by banks do not mean loan waiver, as what Rahul Gandhi thinks. He also says that the bad loans were given during UPA rule and not a single rupee of the loan to corporate has been waived. Taking on Rahul Gandhi’s relentless allegation that all mobile phones sold in India come from China, Arun Jaitley says that while there were only 2 mobile phone manufacturing units in India, today that number has crossed 120. The minister also replies Rahul’s allegations about GST, saying that all states including Congress-ruled states have approved the GST rules.

The polls are scheduled  to take place on 28 November. Chakma has resigned from the State legislature and the primary membership of the Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC ). His resignation has been accepted by the Speaker Hiphei. Chakma’s resignation came a day before the BJP president Amit Shah is going to start  his party’s campaign in the frontier state of Mizoram. He had resigned  as minister of state for fisheries and sericulture in August 2017 to protest against the denial of medical seats to the Chakma tribal students, despite qualifying for MBBS seat under the state quota.

375,OpIndia Staff,"An Ahmedabad city court has issued a summon to AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh over a defamation suit filed by Reliance infrastructure and other Reliance group companies led by Anil Ambani. The Ahmedabad City Civil and Sessions Court has asked the MP to provide a written submission before the court on 20th October in relation to the ₹ 5,000 crores civil defamation suit. The Reliance Group of companies had filed  the suit in February this year, over comments made by Singh in a press conference. While addressing the press on February 13, Sanjay Singh had raised suspicions about the deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighter jets from France. He has said that the Rafale deal is ‘the deal of scams’, alleging that Modi government is paying an “astronomical price” for the jets. The Rajya Sabha MP also had alleged  that a contract worth ₹22,000 crore was awarded to Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence to manufacture parts of the fighter plane, despite the company lacking any experience in the field. He had said, “this all proves beyond doubt that this deal is the deal of scams and this is going to be the last nail in the coffin of the government”. In recent months, Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other Congress party leaders have been making similar accusations. And Reliance group has sent “cease and desist” notices  to several politicians asking them to stop making such statements. Reliance and Dassault Aviation both have clarified that the value Reliance deal with Dassault is much less and there was no government pressure to select Reliance as one of the offset partners.

376,Jinit Jain,"With the BJP giving stiff competition to the Sena in its bailiwick Mumbai, the latter has resorted to eschewing the very principle its foundation was laid on. In a stunning volte-face, Shiv Sena is now attempting  to woo the Muslim voters ahead of the Lok Sabha assembly elections scheduled for next year. It can be safely assumed that ‘Marathi Asmita’ is no longer a campaign watchword for the Shiv Sainiks in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections. Conflating the hitherto two disparate identities of Maratha and Muslim, Shiv Sena has launched ‘Me Marathi Musalman’ in one of its Dussehra rallies. Video of Shiv Sena member Naseeb Shaikh of Beed district was found chanting ‘Me Marathi Muslim’ has emerged. Shaikh, a resident of Sirsala in Parli Taluka can be seen in the video making a clarion call to his community members to come out and participate in the Sena’s Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park in Mumbai. Shaikh claimed that Shiv Sena wanted to create awareness among people about its stand towards Muslims. “We will start a ‘Me Marathi Musalman’ drive with a saffron flag in hand,” he said. Clarifying Sena’s stance, he also proclaimed that Sena had never been against Indians or ‘patriotic’ Muslims, while the opposition continued accruing political mileage by maligning Muslims and using their community to secure vote bank. These surprising turn of events can be attributed to Sena’s realization of being sidelined by other political parties and with their insipid central belief of Maratha supremacism no longer catching voters’ fancy. Shiv Sena was founded in 1966 by Balasaheb Thackrey on the principles of upholding pro-Marathi ideologies and Hindu Nationalism but it seems like it has decided to shun these ideologies and adopt Congress shenanigans of appeasing Muslims and seeking their support in a desperate attempt to stay relevant in the Maharashtra politics. Since its inception, Shiv Sena had vehemently opposed appeasing minorities for votes, but fearing political irrelevance they have now espoused the very policy that they accused the Congress of using it to perpetuate the fault-lines in the society. This hints at the Sena leadership’s intellectual bankruptcy and deficiency of innovative ideas to catch voter’s fascination. Off-late the BJP has aggressively made inroads in the grassroots politics with its innovative campaigns such as Swachh Bharat mission, Jan Dhan Yojana, Demonetisation and various other initiatives reaching the underprivileged and the poor who were ignored by previous Congress regimes. This has caused voters of regional parties to swing towards the BJP and forced the parties to reorient their political strategy. Disillusionment among their primary voters has also caused regional parties to look beyond their traditional vote bank and tap the voters hitherto ignored. In past, Shiv Sena has been accused  of browbeating North Indians residing in Mumbai on the pretext of Marathi-illiteracy as well as snatching the jobs of fellow Maharashtrians. They are also accused of periodically whipping up a frenzy against Muslims. In 2015, Shiv Sena had endorsed  vasectomy of Muslim community. In a scathing attack on PM Modi, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thacrey, in 2017, claimed  that India belongs to Hindus, Muslims have 50 other countries to go to. So the recent attempt by Shiv Sena to woo Muslim voters appears rather opportunistic and disingenuous effort to stall the BJP juggernaut. But as the saying goes ‘Desperate time calls for Desperate measures’, it appears that Shiv Sena is following this maxim in letter and spirit.",2018-10-15,"BJP,Congress,hindu,hindutva,minority appeasement,Narendra Modi,NDA,Shiv Sena","Bereft of new ideas, Shiv Sena resorts to the Congress hack of appeasing Muslims",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/bereft-of-new-ideas-shiv-sena-resorts-to-the-congress-hack-of-appeasing-muslims/
377,OpIndia Staff,"When the Aam Aadmi Party stormed into Indian political scenario, it arrived with a promise of changing the way political parties operate in India. It promised complete honesty and transparency in its operations, and most people believed in it. One the innovative thing the party did was to publish a list of donations it receives on its website, as a proof of transparent nature of its financial activities. But it didn’t take long for the halo around the party to disappear. Soon, there were allegations that the party was receiving donations from dubious sources. At the core of the allegation was regarding a donation of ₹2 crore. A breakaway faction of the party, AAP Volunteer Action Manch (AVAM) had claimed  that the party had received four cheques worth ₹50 lakh each from four different questionable companies. All those four donations were entered into the donation list at 12 am on April 5, 2014. It was found that the addresses of the four companies were fake , they had the same set of directors and they had no known business. At that time, other than the official donation list on the AAP website, another independent website www.aaptrends.com  was also following donations to the party. It was run by one AAP volunteer. But in the second week of April 2014, the site was suddenly  shut down, creating questions among people including AAP supporters. And towards the year 2016, the party removed  the donation list for its website. During that time, the webpage for the list was still there, but it showed a message “under construction. New Version coming soon..”. But that new version never came, and now the link shows a page not found error, means the page has been removed from the site altogether. It was reported  that the page listed many donations above ₹ 20,000, but those were not reported to the Election Commission as per rules, and thus the party removed the list itself from public domain. This removal of the donation list was questioned  by many people, including Yogendra Yadav and Anna Hazare. Former party member Yadav had alleged that the party was collecting cash donations which were not recorded. Rebel AAP member Kapil Mishra also had alleged  that the party was not revealing its total funding to the election commission and Income Tax department. When Income Tax department checked the documents of the party, they found that the party was indeed hiding some of the receipts. There mismatch between credits to the bank account of the party and the amount disclosed by the party to the department. In 2014-15, disclosed amount was ₹13.16 crore less than the received amount. The department also had found money from Hawala operators, and there were discrepancies in its donation report, which the party had changed after pointing out the same. Based on this report by the I-T department, the EC had issued  a show cause notice to the party. During all those controversies, the party’s public donation drive had taken a backseat. But as elections come closer, AAP has restarted its online donation campaign. On Monday they launched a campaign titled ‘Aap Ka Daan, Raashtra Ka Nirmaan’. They have relaunched their donation page on their website, but with a significant change. They have changed the web address for the page, it was donate.aamaadmiparty.org earlier, but now it is donations.aamaadmiparty.org. Along with standalone donations, the party now have provided the option of monthly donations also. Informing about the new fund-raising drive, AAP leader Gopal Rai in a press briefing said  that the party is faced with a resource crunch and it needs the money to continue its operations. Under the campaign, the party will go door-to-door and ask people to contribute a minimum amount of ₹ 100 per month. It is important to note that the cloud around the party’s fund collection earlier still remains. The party has not offered any satisfactory explanation for huge discrepancies in its donation records, neither they have answered why the donation list page was removed and never re-introduced on their website.

Thereby insinuating that India’s performance in hunger has declined sharply while the government is more focused on publicity. Although the current rank of India in the global hunger index is correct, what is depicted by the year wise ranking data is misleading. The annual ranks mentioned creates the impression that India’s ranking was much better earlier and it is on a rapid decline since the Modi government came to power. But that is not true. The steep decline is the result of a change in methodology adopted by IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute), the organisation that calculates the index. Till the year 2014, the institute did not include any country with low hunger levels in the report, and in 2014 there were 44 such countries. All these 44 countries were ranked above India. And if these countries were included in the rankings, India’s 2014 ranking would have been 99, instead of 55. This means that India’s index has remained largely the same over the last five years, with minor variations. The same allegation that India’s rank has declined steeply was made last year also, and responding to queries, IFPRI had informed via email that change in ranking is due to change in method as now all countries are ranked, including those which were excluded earlier. The email had also informed that Despite low rankings, India has done well in reducing hunger, and since 2000 the country had reduced its hunger index by 20%. IFPRI had noted that although India has a lot to do to reduce its hunger levels, claiming that its index has fallen by such huge extent is misleading and not true. Although the Global Hunger Index is an important parameter in measuring the progress of a nation, it is not without some inherent flaws. The index is calculated based on four parameters, percentage of the undernourished population, the percentage of children who die before the age of five, percentage children under five with a low weight-for-height ratio, percentage children under five with a low height-for-age ratio. While the first two parameters can’t be questioned, the same can’t be said about the other two. As economist Arvind Panagariya has noted , the methodology clubs height and weight of all children in the world together and that is taken as a basis for the index. But that is the wrong approach. The reason for low height or low weight for a child may not be malnutrition, but it may be heredity or genetics also. People in different places in the world have different average height and weight, so what is under-weight in one region may be perfectly healthy in another. Panagariya has argued that if appropriate corrections are applied to the index, India will rank much ahead of sub-Saharan countries, which are currently ranked ahead of India. Because average height and weight are higher in those countries, even when other parameters like infant mortality and maternal mortality are much worse than India for them.",2018-10-16,"BJP,Congress,Data,fact check,fake news,Global Hunger Index,manmohan singh,media lies,Media Lies List,misleading,modi government,Narendra Modi,NDTV,Pankaj Pachauri,UPA",Former NDTV journalist and advisor to Manmohan Singh lies about India’s rank in Hunger Index,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/former-ndtv-journalist-and-advisor-to-manmohan-singh-lies-about-indias-rank-in-hunger-index/

As per reports, the hospital administration in Patna’s AIIMS has lodged an FIR on the leftist leader following an altercation with junior doctors of the institution on Sunday evening. Junior doctors in AIIMS, Patna had alleged  that Kanhaiya and his supporters had misbehaved with them and hospital staff on Sunday evening. They had threatened to go on a strike if the hospital does not take action against the leftist leader. As per latest reports, the strike was called off after the hospital lodged an FIR against Kanhaiya and his supporters on Monday. According to reports , leftist student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, along with his supporters had gone to AIIMS on Sunday evening to visit AISF State Secretary Sushil Kumar, who was admitted there for treatment. The leader and his supporters who allegedly  entered the ward in a big group to meet Sushil Kumar, got into an altercation with the junior doctors of the orthopaedic department and the hospital staff as they attempted to caution the leader of the hospital rules, asking them to meet the patient one at a time. Kanhaiya Kumar and his gang irked by the instructions given to them allegedly started creating a ruckus. Junior doctor Avinash Pandey reportedly asked the hospital security personnel to escort them out. The junior doctors have alleged that following this, Kanhaiya’s supporters started misbehaving with the hospital staff and nurses.

384,K Bhattacharjee,"Senior Congress leader, Shashi Tharoor, has stirred up  a controversy with his latest remarks on Hindus and Ram Janambhoomi. Tharoor, while addressing the gathering, said, “While a vast majority of Hindus believes that Ayodhya was the birthplace of Lord Ram, no good Hindu would want to see a Ram temple built by demolishing somebody else’s place of worship”. With a single remark, Tharoor has branded hundreds and thousands of devout pious Hindus as ‘bad’ merely because they disagree with Mr. Tharoor and want a Bhavya Ram Mandir to be built at the birthplace of Shri Rama. It is regrettable that politicians are insulting Hindus for merely wanting a grand Temple to be built at Ayodhya. It appears that Tharoor is unaware of the sentiment that is simmering within Hindus. The political party whose journey to power began with the Ram Janambhoomi movement currently enjoys an overwhelming share of political power in the country. If every Hindu is ‘bad’ merely because Mr. Tharoor believes so, then he is insulting the intelligence of the vast majority of the electorate which elected the BJP to power. Thus far, the Congress party had maintained  a certain ambiguity on their stance on the Ram Mandir by refusing to comment on the matter. However, considering the fact that another senior leader of the Congress party, Kapil Sibal, has attempted  to delay the matter in courts on several occasions, it appears clear that unless the party comes out and states otherwise, Tharoor’s stance on the issue reflects the official opinion of the party on the matter, especially considering the conduct of one of their leaders in the court. A politician should not involve himself with the business of issuing certificates on moral conduct to the electorate. And it reflects on Tharoor as a politician that he would demonize vast swathes of the country for merely seeking something as basic as a Temple at Shri Rama’s Janmabhoomi. The loyalty to the Babri Masjid that is displayed by certain sections of society and politicians even today is a cause for worry to the integrity of our nation. It has been established  conclusively, and beyond any point of reasonable doubt, that the Babri Masjid was indeed built after demolishing a Temple in its stead. The ideology that led to the demolition of the Temple and the construction of the Babri is the same vicious ideology that led to the formation of Pakistan. It is understandable if Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are disturbed by the demolition of the Babri but why should any Indian politician or citizen be disturbed by the demolition of a building that was an enduring testimony to the hardships and misery that the Hindu people were forced through by the Muslim invaders? Tharoor’s remarks also reveal what anglophile deracinated liberals think of Hindus. As long as Hindus don’t raise their voice against the million injustices that is afflicted on them on a daily basis, they are worthy of praise. As long as Hindus continue to carry the burden of secularism on their shoulders while being demonized as fascists, they are honourable. As long as Hindus don’t complain against the blatant minority appeasement by the so-called secular parties and ignore the destruction of the Hindu civilization, they are exemplary citizens. But the moment Hindus start uniting under the banner of Shri Rama, the moment they start uniting under the banner of Lord Ayyappa, the moment Hindus reject the bad deal that has been enforced on them by decades of appeasement and misrule, the moment Hindus refuse to sacrifice their culture and traditions to the ceaseless march of evangelistic liberalism, they are branded evil, monstrous and vile. Anglophiles like Tharoor want Hindus to be sheep and willingly walk to the slaughterhouse without so much as a whimper. The Congress party will be better served if Tharoor sticks to typing complicated words on social media that nobody cares about, especially at a time when the party is struggling hard to shed its anti-Hindu image. Ahead of the assembly elections in key states, the Congress party is going full throttle in its devotion towards Hindu Gods and ethos. Under such circumstances, it does not bode well for the party that a senior leader of the Congress party has come out and said that only a ‘bad’ Hindu wants a Ram Temple at Ayodhya. It even exposes the fact that the Congress’ soft Hindutva approach is merely for electoral benefits and not a sudden change of heart as some of them would have us believe.",2018-10-15,"Ayodhya dispute,Babri Masjid,Congress,INC,Kapil Sibal,rahul gandhi,ram janambhoomi,Ram Janmabhoomi,Ram Mandir,Ram Temple,Shashi Tharoor",Congress will be better off if Tharoor sticks to typing complicated words instead of commenting on Ram Mandir,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/congress-will-be-better-off-if-tharoor-stick-to-typing-complicated-words-instead-of-commenting-on-ram-mandir/

Sanjay Nirupam has a track record of using derogatory language against Prime Minister Modi. Last month, objecting to the screening of a documentary made on the early life of PM Modi for school children he had called  PM Modi ‘unpadh-ganwar’ (illiterate and uncouth). Instead of apologising for such crass language he went on defending  his comment by saying that PM was no ‘God’. That’s not it. Earlier he had posted  a misogynist tweet against Textile Minister Smriti Irani who was at that time heading the Information and Broadcasting Ministry regarding the withdrawing of the directives curbing the fake news by the I&B Ministry. However, Sanjay Nirupam is not the only leader in Congress to have stooped so low by using derogatory language against PM Modi. He was given a tough competition by his colleague Mani Shankar Aiyyar who had mocked  PM Modi’s humble beginnings by calling him a ‘Chaiwalla’ and a ‘Neech Insan’. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad too has made a casteist statement on PM Modi by referring to him as ‘Gangu Teli’ (Modi belongs to the Teli caste).

386,Sanghamitra,"We all know the deep emotional attachment Congress President Rahul Gandhi has with mobile factories. Wherever he addresses a rally, he adds the name of that place to the never-ending lists of possible mobile factories  he plans to build when he comes to power. It works like a format. His speech goes, “when the people in China click a selfie, I want them to flip their mobiles and see ‘made in xxx’ written on it.” The speech has become so predictable that nowadays people on social media announce the arrival of mobile factories beforehand, looking at the scheduled speeches of Rahul Gandhi. Just when the mobile factory jokes  begun to feel a little too predictable, Rahul seems to have come up with another ‘fill in the blanks’ speech format. This time, it is about people flocking to the Indian parliament just when they are about to take off to foreign countries. No, EAM Swaraj has not planted teleportation capsules inside parliament, neither has the house started offering special travel coupons. As per Rahul Gandhi’s claim, people storm into parliament before leaving for London and finance minister Arun Jaitley extends them warm farewell wishes before they leave for the airport. Last month, Congress had alleged that FM Arun Jaitley had ‘met’ absconding millionaire Vijay Mallya before he left for London. Vijay Mallya had stated to the press claiming the same and soon Rahul Gandhi held a press conference , asking for Arun Jaitley’s resignation. A Congress leader named PL Punia had even claimed to have ‘witnessed’ the meeting.  the allegations and had explained that Mallya did abuse his privileges as an MP and tried to approach the FM inside the parliament premises, but he had refused to listen to Mallya and had advised him to ‘talk to his bankers’ instead.Arun Jaitley had denied Later, a fact check  about the veracity of the claims had also proven that the finance minister’s statements were indeed corroborative as per the schedule of the parliament and his activities that day. Congress’ claims had fallen flat. Now, a month later, Rahul Gandhi has made similar claims. Only he has removed Vijay Mallya’s name and filled in Nirav Modi’s. Speaking at a rally in Datia, Madhya Pradesh, the Congress prince has claimed that Nirav Modi went to the parliament house to meet FM Arun Jaitley before he flew to London. In the live video shared above by Congress, Rahul Gandhi is seen making the claim. 9 minutes and 40 seconds into the video, Rahul Gandhi claims, ” Nirav Modi took 35 thousand crores and went to parliament house to meet Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Arun Jaitley has himself admitted it. Nirav Modi went to meet him in parliament and said that I am going to London.” Now, brushing aside all the disturbing mental images of Nirav Modi dragging huge suitcases of currency notes (for it was Rahul Gandhi only who had earlier claimed  that PM Modi took away the demonetised notes and gave it all to Nirav Modi) all the way through the sprawling lawns of parliament building, let us for a moment think about the accusations being made here systematically. Rahul Gandhi has a lot to answer. People on social media have been asking the question too. Goof-ups and jumbling up of facts is something Rahul Gandhi habitually does. Even on the issue of his current favourite topic of Rafale deal , the Congress President has been citing ever-changing facts and figures , never being certain of exactly how much money PM Modi is supposed to have ‘gifted’ Anil Ambani. Even the negotiated price of the fighter jets that he claims keeps on changing event after event. This has happened earlier. Even on the Doklam issue, Rahul Gandhi kept on bringing allegation after allegation, speech after speech claiming how the Modi government had failed to handle the crisis and how all hell is about to break loose. But after an awkward question during his Europe tour compelled him to admit he ‘had no details’ of the Doklam issue and cannot answer  how he could have handled it better, Rahul seems to have made his peace with the Doklam issue. So far we have had mobile factories  in Uttar Pradesh, Dungarpur, Mumbai, Chitrakoot, Bhopal and about a dozen other places in India. After today’s claims, it seems like now we will have a list of people who manage to enter into one of the most secured buildings in the country, the parliament house, before flying abroad. Either the parliament house would have to start a direct baggage check-in facility for the Indira Gandhi International Airport or our beloved Finance Minster will have to open a special counter for all the fleeing billionaires that are lining up to meet him before fleeing the country. Maybe Mr Jaitley will consider gifting them special shopping coupons from www.madeinamethi.com  for a range of Rahul Gandhi’s favourite merchandise as a farewell present.",2018-10-15,"Arun Jaitley,congress gaffes,congress leaders,Member of Parliament,mobile,nirav modi,Parliament,PNB scam,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Rajya Sabha,vijay mallya",Is ‘Parliament House’ the new Mobile factory?

388,OpIndia Staff,"One of the contenders for the seat of Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh from the Congress party, Kamal Nath, took to Twitter and accused the BJP dispensation in power of rampant corruption. He used a picture of a shoddily constructed road that’s falling apart to take potshots at Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s government. This was also retweeted by the Twitter handle of Madhya Pradesh Congress. Unfortunately for the Congress leader, the picture does not depict any place in Madhya Pradesh or even in India but Bangladesh. The picture was shared on Twitter in June 2016 by user @RifatAlam007 who was quite disillusioned with his own government. Another report  from an apparent Indonesian outlet in September 2016 claims that the folding road is from Indonesia. Madhu Kishwar had been slammed  by then Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, for claiming that the image was from Bihar. Therefore, it’s quite clear that the image is either from Indonesia or Bangladesh but definitely not from anywhere in India. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was quick to bust the narrative the Congress leader was peddling. He said, “What can we say about our friends from the Congress party? First, Digvijay Singh brought a pool in Pakistan to Madhya Pradesh and now Kamal Nath has brought a Bangladeshi road to Madhya Pradesh.” Shivraj Singh Chouhan was referring to Digvijay Singh’s blooper in June when he claimed that the photo he had shared on Twitter showed a damaged overbridge from Subhash Nagar Railways Faatak in Bhopal. However, the damaged bridge almost certainly was from Pakistan and surely not from Madhya Pradesh as has been reported  by us earlier. Digvijay Singh later issued  an apology over the tweet.

However, As per a report by MyNation , the HAL Staff Union General Secretary, Suryadevara Chandra Shekhar, had explicitly denied extending support to Rahul Gandhi in his political histrionics as they consider Narendra Modi as their leader and have full faith in his leadership. General Secretary, Shekhar said , “We represent the government and will not meet any political forums. We are government employees and represent Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. We are pained that HAL has not been given the opportunity to manufacture Rafale, but we have spoken to the Defence Minister about it.” Upholding individual’s freedom of choice, the Staff Union said that the employees are free to attend Gandhi’s visit but their Union won’t share a platform with him. “Employees can attend the event as it is their individual choice. We will not be sharing the stage with Rahul Gandhi,” states circular from HAL’s Employees Union. Even HAL company management have echoed the Staff Union’s sentiments and issued  a circular advising their employees to refrain from attending Saturday’s interaction, as it might invite action under employees’ code of conduct. The HAL Union has planned to write a letter to the government, appealing it to not abandon the 78-year-old Public Sector Unit(PSU) company and securing a fresh contract from the Indian Airforce with the hope to salvage themselves from the abyss they are staring at. Amidst all this, Rahul Gandhi met some of the past and current employees of the HAL in an interaction in Bengaluru this evening. Addressing the people there, he continued with his hackneyed rhetorics of blaming Narendra Modi and the BJP for the woeful state of HAL. In yet another blatant attempt to change the goalpost and deceive the listeners, Rahul Gandhi took ouster of HAL from the Rafale deal as Private sector versus Public sector battle and accused the government of allegedly colluding with the private partners to undermine Public sector companies such as HAL. N Sitharaman had already busted  this lie in a press conference and blamed Congress for HAL’s exclusion from the deal. In a run-up to the state assembly polls scheduled to happen sometime later this year, it is widely considered that Rahul Gandhi’s visit to HAL is just an extension of his political dramatics to target Narendra Modi led BJP in their alleged role in the alleged corruption case in Rafale fighter jets deal.

Is the Sai Balaji Petroleum in Vikhroli, Mumbai doing such a campaign through its bills? Singhvi is not the first person to post this on Social media. Actually, this image, which says it is an HPL dealer, has already become viral for the last several days. And it has been proved that the bill is fake, not real.

Several women colleagues of MJ Akbar have come out with allegations of sexual misconduct against him when he held senior editorial positions in a number of media organisations. Akbar was on an official foreign tour when these accusations were levelled against him. He returned to India on Sunday and issued a lengthy statement. In his statement he said , “The allegations of misconduct made against me are false and fabricated, spiced up by innuendo and malice. I could not reply earlier as I was on an official tour abroad. Accusation without evidence has become a viral fever among some sections. Whatever be the case, now that I have returned, my lawyers will look into these wild and baseless allegations in order to decide our future course of legal action.” Questioning the timings of the accusations Akbar said , “Why has this storm risen a few months before a general election? Is there an agenda? You be the judge. These false, baseless and wild allegations have caused irreparable damage to my reputation and goodwill.” Rubbishing the accusations one by one in his statement, the Minister explained that the women who accused him continued to work as his colleagues after the alleged incidents. “It is pertinent to remember that both Ms Ramani and Ms Wahab kept working with me even after these alleged incidents; this clearly establishes that they had no apprehension and discomfort. The reason why they remained silent for decades is very apparent: as Ms Ramani has herself stated, I never did anything,” he said.

Journalists like Prashant Jha  and film director Vikas Bahl,  The Wire’s co-founder and founding editor Siddharth Bhatia  and their senior journalist Vinod Dua . Another journalist who has been accused while #MeToo gripped the country was Uttam Sengupta,  who is now the Executive Editor of Congress mouthpiece National Herald. National Herald is owned by the Gandhi family  and is currently under ligitation for alleged scam perpetuated by the Gandhi family. The victim has also alleged that she reported his harassment and intimidation tactics following which a “sham internal inquiry” took place at National Herald. Considering Uttam Sengupta still works at National Herald, no action was taken against him and the victim “left in disgust”. She has also asked whether Congress would now throw Uttam Sengupta out. But National Herald seems to be brazening it out. While most people who have been accused have come out to make a statement, the National Herald has remained tight-lipped and so has their Executive Editor. Not just have the publication or the Sengupta refused to issue a statement, they have published several articles regarding the #MeToo movement, the latest, authored by a journalist called Shuma Raha. In the article, Raha talks about how the movement has been empowering and exhilarating, but also sounds a word of caution about believing third-hand accounts. While the silence from the publication is deafening, they have gone ahead and asserted that not all accounts of harassment should be believed, would seem like a preemptive assertion to save Uttam Sengupta and some like him who might be close to the power circle. It is interesting that Shuma Raha would write an article  about the #MeToo movement on National Herald, whose Executive Editor himself is accused of sexual harassment at workplace. In fact, National Herald too is being accused of conducting a ‘sham inquiry’ and doing enough for the victim. The author herself has made some strange comments regarding the movement on her Twitter account. She has said that the #MeToo movement shouldn’t drown the Rafale ‘revelations’. In fact, it is even more interesting that Shuma, who has written an article pontificating about the #MeToo movement on National Herald, has been retweeting the very person who has been accused of sexual harassment. The National Herald itself has been shameless in its conduct by publishing several reports on the wave of women coming out with the sexual harassment tales while keeping quiet on the conduct of their own senior staff. They have published several articles in this regard.

393,OpIndia Staff,"BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday urged the BJP party workers to work hard to secure victory in 200 seats in the upcoming Assembly polls. Shah was addressing a BJP booth workers’ meeting in Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh. According to the reports , Amit Shah accused Congress party of indulging in vote bank politics ahead of elections. He further attacked Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for using infiltrators as their vote banks and said his party considers the issue of illegal infiltrators as a matter of national security. He went on to say that the BJP government will expel every infiltrator from the country. “40 Lakh infiltrators were identified & as soon as it happened, right from ‘Diggi Raja’ to ‘Rahul Baba’, all of them started making noises in Parliament. For Congress, SP & BSP infiltrators are vote banks, for BJP they are an issue of national security”, said  Amit Shah. Amit Shah speaking to the party workers said the BJP securing  more than 200 seats will inspire other BJP party workers across the country. “The party can form the government with less than 200 seats, but we need to cross the 200-mark because our workers in West Bengal, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are looking towards Madhya Pradesh,” Shah said to BJP party workers. He further added said that BJP is the party of workers and even a tea seller can become the PM. Shah addressing the gathering of booth workers shared his experience of being a small worker in the party before being the national president of the party. He thanked the party workers for their sacrifices and said, “It’s their sacrifices that have brought us here today. We should score such a mammoth victory in MP and then in 2019 that we should rule from Panchayat to Parliament for the next 50 years.’’ Amit Shah slammed  Kamal Nath for his inability to develop Madhya Pradesh despite being Union minister and asked party workers to knock on every household in the state and talk about the injustice they faced under the Congress rule. The BJP president challenged the Congress to declare its chief ministerial face in MP. He took a dig at the state Congress leadership by saying that elections cannot be won by “Raja, Maharaja and Udyogpati”, a reference to Congress leaders Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath, respectively. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the dates for the assembly elections  in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Telangana.

394,OpIndia Staff,"Soon after UP CM Yogi Adityanath declared that if a consensus is reached to rename Allahabad, his government will change its name to Prayagraj, the Congress party on Sunday has come out opposing  the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s decision. According to the reports , Congress spokesperson Onkar Singh said that Allahabad had a history attached to it, which has played an important role since the days of Independence and renaming the name of the city to Prayagraj by erasing Allahabad would be an insult to the freedom movement. Onkar Singh further added that if the UP government is very much interested in changing the name, then a separate city of ‘Prayagraj’ can be carved out of Allahabad. Singh further said, “During Gandhi-era and fight for independence, Allahabad has been a center for inspiration. In 1888, 1892 and then in 1910, Congress Mahaadhiveshans took place here, which gave shape to the freedom movement. The city gave the country its first Prime Minister. Moreover, the Allahabad University would lose its identity as it would also be named Prayagraj University.” Ahead of the Kumbh Mela next year, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday had announced  that his government will rename the Allahabad district to Prayagraj after achieving the consensus. He had also said that he had got the Governor’s approval for renaming the city. CM Yogi said, “Ganga aur Yamuna do pavitra nadi ka sangam ka sthal hone ke nate yahan sabhi prayago ka raaj hai, isiliye Allahabad ko Prayag raj bhi kehte hain (Two holy rivers, Ganga and Yamuna, join in Allahabad and hence there’s ‘raj’ of all ‘prayag’, confluence of rivers. And therefore, Allahabad is also known as Prayag Raj).” BJP state spokesperson Manoj Mishra said the announcement has been made to respect the sentiments of lakhs and crores of people of the state. “Akbar ki Nishani Ko mita kar pauranik naam dena shreyaskar hai. (To remove the sign of Akbar and give a historical name is good).” The Uttar Pradesh government in the past had also renamed  the iconic Mughalsarai railway station to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction on Monday.

395,Abhishek Banerjee,"She was a young AAP volunteer from Narela in Delhi. Her name was Soni. She killed herself in 2016. According to her family, she had been worried and tense about constant sexual harassment by one Ramesh Bhardwaj, allegedly  an AAP leader. But the matter goes far deeper because Soni had taken up the matter of sexual harassment with no less than Kejriwal himself. His response? Here it is: “Compromise”. Really? Did that actually happen? Absolutely. In fact, Aaj Tak even showed the chilling video where AAP worker Soni said that Kejriwal had asked her to ‘compromise’ (watch here  from 9:55). Here, Soni declares that she is in so much depression that she wishes to commit suicide. Chilling words from Delhi CM Kejriwal: “ She didn’t compromise. She committed suicide instead. Possibly, the only people who ‘compromised’ were our collective of liberal journalists, thinkers and opinion makers. This was the victim on video admitting that Delhi’s Chief Minister had told her to compromise with sexual harassment. The victim admitting on video that the constant sexual harassment and the insensitive response from AAP leadership, including Kejriwal himself, is driving her to commit suicide. And then, sadly, she went ahead and actually killed herself. When I mentioned this incident on Twitter last evening, it seemed that few had heard of it before. Most people could not believe that such an incident had passed almost without comment in media, without any nationwide outrage. They demanded I provide links to prove my claims. They could not believe their eyes and ears when I did. When such a sad thing happens, there is an urge to condemn anyone who makes it political and perhaps rightly so. But then, this is all political, is it not? Does anyone seriously believe that such an explosive allegation against a BJP Chief Minister would have been forgotten by the media? For what it’s worth, Prime Minister Modi is in the dock every single day for any tweet by any person that he is following on Twitter. And here, Kejriwal waltzes in, supposedly tells a woman to “compromise” with sexual abuse. The victim goes into depression and commits suicide. The media forgets all about it. We all know that this was only possible because Kejriwal is ‘secular.’ Of late, the #MeToo movement has ripped off the masks of a lot of people who were given to lecturing the rest of us about being progressive, liberal and modern. Behind that edgy, “woke” comedian who makes “Azaadi” look sexy is a predator who will send d*ck picks to minor girls over the internet. Behind that sour-faced anchor who poses as the voice of dissent is a monster who will corner a young intern in his car and start slobbering all over her face. In other words, the  #MeToo movement has brought the establishment face to face with decades of its own crimes. But what happens if the victim of sexual harassment is no longer alive? Worse, what happens when she has committed suicide? Does the crime that she suffered and the liberal moral giant who enabled it to get to go free of all blame?

396,OpIndia Staff,"There is no end to bizarre and outrageous allegations by Congress party on the Rafale deal. On the day their Party president Rahul Gandhi is trying to instigate workers of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to create unrest in the organisation, thereby affecting production in the crucial plant, the party’s twitter handle went into overdrive mode while covering Rahul Gandhi’s latest adventure. While so, Congress’ official Twitter handle ended up alleging that the Modi government has “favoured Rafale over HAL”. This tweet had left many people scratching their heads, as Rafale is a fighter aircraft and HAL is a public sector enterprise which mainly assembles fighter planes with kits supplied by global defence equipment manufacturers. The screenshot of the tweet is given below, which has been deleted by the Twitter handle of the party now. The moment the tweet was posted, alert Twitter users spotted the apparent goof up and it became a subject of amusement for social media users. The Congress party and Rahul Gandhi often become victims of goof ups by Rahul Gandhi in his speeches, or tweets by various leaders of the party, and it was no different. The gaffe by the Congress party was not limited to Twitter only. For last one week, it was being reported that Rahul Gandhi will meet HAL employees today. But it seems nobody had actually arranged such a meet and nobody had a clue who is organising what, creating a confusion  over the entire subject. HAL authorities said they have not even received a request from Congress to hold the meet in the organisation. After that Congress claims that retired employees of HAL had organised the meet. But the trade union of HAL had said that Congress party had approached them requesting a meeting and the union had not taken any decision yet. At last, the authorities of HAL refused to let Rahul Gandhi meet the employees inside the premises of the company. The company also asked its staff not to attend the meet as they don’t want employees of the company to be involved in any political controversy. Due to this, the party had to shift  the venue of the meet to Minsk Square in Bengaluru, where mostly retired employees of HAL attended the meeting.",2018-10-13,"congress gaffes,congress IT cell,divya spandana,goof up,HAL,INC,Rafale,rafale deal,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi,Social Media,Twitter","After Rahul Gandhi’s HAL visit flip-flop, Congress Twitter handle goofs up while talking about the event",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/after-rahul-gandhis-hal-visit-flip-flop-congress-twitter-handle-goofs-up-while-talking-about-the-event/
397,OpIndia Staff,"We have reported  earlier on the targeted violence in Gujarat against non-Gujaratis following the rape of a 14-month old girl in the state. The Police had confirmed  the involvement of Congress leaders in the violence that had ensued and the consequent exodus of migrants from the from Gujarat. The state government was forced  to make an appeal to those affected to return and that things had been brought under control. Police have arrested hundreds of people for violence on non-Gujaratis, most of them members of Thakor Sena led by Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor. Several Congress leaders also have been arrested after evidence of their involvement in instituting was surfaced. While all these developments are taking place, the Chhattisgarh wing of the Youth Congress took to Twitter to share an image that was claimed to be of migrants fleeing Gujarat in recent days and equated the event with the partition of the country in 1947. The image was shared with a caption that appeared to blame the BJP for the riots. A simple Google image search reveals that the picture is definitely not of the recent riots in Gujarat. It is a Reuters photo that appears in an article  by BBC in 2012. The same image with higher resolution appears on International Business Times in 2011. The image is described  as “Hindu devotees travel on a crowded passenger train to take part in the “Guru Purnima” festival in Goverdhan town near the northern Indian city of Mathura”. While it is becoming increasingly evident that Congress leaders were involved with the targeted violence against non-Gujaratis in the state, the party is resorting to spreading Fake News to boost its electoral prospects. The Congress MLA had even announced  an indefinite fast demanding the release of the riot accused arrested by the Police. He was even seen in a video making incendiary remarks  against migrants in the state.

Furthermore, it was claimed that 45 of its 121 MLAs and 6 of its 22 MPs were “in danger zone”.

The report quoted unnamed sources to back up its assertions. However, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP came out on Twitter and called the entire TOI report ‘Fake News’.

399,OpIndia Staff,"What comes as a tough blow  to the awkward coalition the Congress-JD(S) government, stitched up in an attempt to knuckle down the BJP government in the recent Karnataka assembly elections, is that the lone BSP Minister, N Mahesh, resigned his position  in the coalition ministry on Thursday. Though the minister said  he is resigning over “personal reasons”, it is believed the surprise move came days after BSP chief Mayawati announced that her party would not forge an alliance with the Congress “ Claiming that the decision was taken without consulting the party supremo Mayawati, the Minister said, “I am resigning my post as a cabinet minister but continue as an MLA and I support the JD(S) and Kumaraswamy… I want to concentrate on my constituency.” Assuring to continue supporting the coalition government, Mahesh said he would campaign for the JD(S) during the bypolls for three Lok Sabha and two assembly seats on November 3. “I do not have any grouse against anybody in the government. As a minister, I did my best and toured the state. This resignation is purely due to personal reasons,” he said. Congress party has been incidentally facing a massive internal turmoil, as they move toward the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Along with several disclosures  of rifts  within the JDS-Congress alliance doing the rounds, continuous news of many regional leaders distancing themselves from the party have emerged.

In a similar setback, senior Congress leader and 4 times Meghalaya CM DD Lapang  had resigned from the party after citing frustrations due to faulty party policies.

Senior party leader and Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) member Rajendra Jain and the party’s Gujarat unit spokesperson Nakul Singh said, “We are trying to have a coalition with like-minded parties in the state. We will contest more than 200 seats out of the total 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh”. As the NCP’s preparedness for the forthcoming MP elections gathered momentum, the party also seems to be gearing up for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Keeping an eye on the same, the NCP supremo on Friday, called  for a meeting of senior leaders of the party’s Maharashtra unit as “he is keen to finalise or at least shortlist the candidates as early as possible so that preparations for the polls can start,” a party leader said. “Seat-sharing talks with the Congress are likely to be concluded soon. Except for three or four seats which might be contentious, both parties know which seats they will contest,” the leader furthered. In the NCP-Congress alliance, the NCP demanded to contest an equal number of seats in Maharashtra this time, unlike in 2014, when NCP had contested 21 seats in the state, winning four, while the Congress contested 27 and won two seats.

One of the slain terrorists was identified as Mannan Wani, the former PhD scholar from Aligarh Muslim University  who had joined Hizbul Mujahideen. Gautam Gambhir, Indian cricketer took to Twitter to express his angst against politicians. He tweeted that we managed to kill a terrorist but lost a ‘radicalised talent’. He then tagged all parties and politicians who have been governing the state of Kashmir. He said that Mehbooba Mufli, Omar Abdullah, the Congress and the BJP should be ashamed of themselves that they allowed a man to turn from books to guns. To this, Omar Abdullah lashed out at Gambhir with a bizarre rhetoric. He said that Gambhir wouldn’t be able to find Mannan Wani’s home district on a map. He said that Gambhir ‘presuming to know’ what drives young men to pick up the weapon in Kashmir is like Omar talking about cricket. Gambhir then said that it is Omar Abdullah who is hell-bent on changing the map of Kashmir and that he should explain what he and his fellow politicians have done to engage the youth of Kashmir. Omar Abdullah proceeded to toe the usual line and talk about how he doesn’t need a ‘lecture in nationalism’. To which, Gautam Gambhir too retorted sharply. In this bizarre exchange of words between Gautam Gambhir and Omar Abdullah, the glaring fact is that Gambhir, just as any citizen asked a legitimate question as to what the politicians were doing when young men seem to turn themselves into terrorists.

But the HAL employees association has reportedly officially distanced itself from the meeting. According to a report  in the News Minute, Suryadevara Chandra Sekhar, the general secretary of HAL’s employee’s union, stated that the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee had approached the HAL employees union and had formally requested them to be present at the event. But as HAL is a government organisation, they cannot attend a political party’s event. However, if some employees and retired personnel want to attend the event in their individual capacity, they cannot be stopped. Sekhar, however, has added  that the employees union will write to PM Modi highlighting HAL’s contribution to India’s defence capabilities and request him to make sure the PSU is kept at its functional best by getting it more orders from the Indian Air Force. The HAL had yesterday issued a circular for its employees reminding them of the employees’ code of conduct and asking them not to attend political events. Suryadeva confirmed that the HAL employees union will not be sharing the stage with Rahul Gandhi at the Cubbon Park event. As per reports , the Bengaluru police has allowed the party to hold a meeting for 90 minutes near the Minsk Square outside HAL corporate office, from 3.30 pm onwards. A report  in Times of India states that Congres has cut down the events’ programs after learning of the employees union decision and is now planning to hold only one ‘interaction with mostly retired and some serving employees’. Congress party and Rahul Gandhi had aimed the event to launch fresh attacks at the government over their claim that the government has ‘cheated’ HAL in the Rafale deal and ‘gifted it to Anil Ambani’. After yesterday’s developments, Congress seems to have mellowed down on its claims. The KPCC vice president has reportedly stated, “It is not about Rahul Gandhi coming to meet HAL employees. It is about HAL’s contribution to India and there will be a discussion about it. Anyone can participate, former or present employees and even interested people.” The Times of India report also states that Congress had initially planned a ‘padayatra’ from Congress Bhavan in Bengaluru to HAL Headquarters, but that event has been cancelled too. The central government, the French Government , Dassault Aviation and many defence experts have refuted  the allegations of Congress claiming  ‘Reliance being favoured over HAL’. However, there has been repeated attempts by Congress leadership and a certain section of media to spread misinformation about the deal.

405,K Bhattacharjee,"Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvid Kejriwal, shared a message on Twitter that he claimed he had received from a parent on the morning of the 13th of October. In the message, the parent thanked Kejriwal for the fee rollback and said that parents were discussing among themselves that only Kejriwal could have done it and proclaimed ‘Bande me dum hai!’ People are, however, speculating that Kejriwal had himself typed the message so that he could pat himself on the back. The reason cited for such an assumption was that the red line that shows an error while typing could be spotted in the message under the word ‘mein’. Therefore, people concluded that Kejriwal had himself typed the message, took a screenshot and then shared it on Twitter himself to score political brownie points. It could very well be that Kejriwal did receive the message, as he claims he did, and the parent did take a screenshot of the message while he/she was typing the message.

If the parent sent the message over email or WhatsApp or even through Direct Message on Twitter, then the ‘red line’ wouldn’t have appeared. If the parent sent him the message via a tweet, then a screenshot could have been necessary due to the character limit but then Kejriwal could have simply retweeted the tweet. Taking all things into consideration, a case of Kejriwal calling Kejriwal is very much possible considering the downward spiral the Aam Aadmi party has been on in recent times. The suggestion also doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility considering how many times Arvind Kejriwal has tweeted a rumour with the “Is it true?” template and that information has more often than not turned out to be false.  However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Kejriwal did indeed receive that message.",2018-10-13,"Aam Aadmi Party,AAP,Arvind Kejriwal,Delhi,delhi CM,Delhi Government,drama,Education,fake news,Social Media",Shocking if true: People speculate whether Kejriwal wrote a message to himself congratulating himself for his work,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/shocking-if-true-people-speculate-whether-kejriwal-wrote-a-message-to-himself-congratulating-himself-for-his-work/

An accommodation entry refers to documents that reflect fake loans transacted by bogus means or shell firms in order to evade taxes. The search teams, an official said, raided  locations in Delhi’s upscale residential areas like Vasant Kunj and Defence Colony, offices and residences in Paschim Vihar, Najafgarh, Laxmi Nagar and Palam Vihar area in Gurgaon. The search operations, that were on till late evening yesterday, were being conducted as part of a tax evasion probe against two firms, Brisk Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd, which is involved in real estate business and Corporate International Financial Services Limited, a non-banking financial company, that are operated and owned by the family members of Gahlot, the official said. Media reports have quoted an I-T department official as saying that the two firms were being probed for tax evasion after reports of multiple undisclosed transactions and alleged under-reporting of profits.

407,OpIndia Staff,"French publication Mediapart  has till now published two misleading reports on the Rafale deal. First one came when it published a quote by former French President Hollande  where he reportedly had said that the Government of India had proposed that the Anil Ambani owned Reliance Defence should be the service provider to Dassault in the mega-deal. As the controversy escalated, the French government issued a statement that the contract between the French and the Indian government was strictly related to the delivery and quantity of the aircraft. It further clarified that the French government had no role to play in the choice of Indian industrial partners and French companies have the full freedom to choose the Indian company they want to partner with. OpIndia had then reported how the facts  of the deal are being selectively ignored by the politicians to score a political point. We had explained how as per the offset obligations put by India, Dassault would have to fulfil offset obligations of 50% of total deal value in the forms of investment in India, purchase from India, or transfer of technology to Indian companies. As per the offset agreement, Dassault got into contracts with hundreds of companies including Anil Ambani led Reliance as well as state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Despite the clarifications, in less than a month, Mediapart again came up with another misleading report  which claimed that deal with Reliance was mandatory for Dassault. The report quoted Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation Loik Segalen to have said, “It was imperative and mandatory for Dassault Aviation to accept this counterpart (offset partnership), in order to seal the deal to sell Rafale jet to India.” The quote appears to have been mischievously quoted since Dassault again had to reiterate though a statement that as Segalen said, it was indeed ‘imperative and mandatory’ for Dassault to accept the offset partnership, nowhere does it mention the offset partner has to be Reliance. In fact, as per French labour laws, any major decision taken by companies which may not lead to new employment generation for French workers, need to be informed to Central Works Council. The above statement by Segalen appears more of a message to the representatives of the union who were present there instead of an insinuation that they were arm-twisted into getting into a contract with Reliance for the contract. This repeated misleading reports by the French media Mediapart, which were picked up and shared widely by various mainstream media as well as Congress leaders, made a lot of Twitter users wonder about the ulterior motives of the reports. Twitter user @bns5 , in a series of tweets , showed how the owner of Mediapart, when the report came out last night, had reached out to certain individuals to spread the message. He says that as soon as the article by Mediapart was out, the first one to share it was Noopur Tiwari of NDTV. An article  on Plenel from April 2013 quotes a senior French radio journalist describing Plenel as, “vigilante not a journalist…someone who confuses journalism with personal vendettas and crusades.” His former colleagues at Le Monde, where he was an editor once, describe him as ‘tyrant’ and ‘bully’. In March this year, Naëm Bestandji, a secular feminist activist, has accused  Plenel of becoming a groupie of Marwan Muhammad, former director of Collective against Islamophobia in France, CCIF, who according to Bestandji, discriminates against people like him, (French of Maghrebi origin) and insults them in the name of ‘tolerance and anti-racism.’ This brings us to how and why are the mainstream media persons and Congress leaders so quick to believe a white man who seems to be having questionable credentials?",2018-10-11,"Hollande,Media,media bias,NDTV,Rafale,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,The Wire,Twitter",People question why this French publication has peddled two misleading reports on Rafale till now,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/people-question-why-this-french-publication-has-peddled-two-misleading-reports-on-rafale-till-now/
408,OpIndia Staff,"The Congress’s bogey of the ‘Hindu-Terror’ to defame Hindus is being exposed gradually, as RVS Mani, former under-secretary in the Minister of Home Affairs, has come out with another shocking video revealing the details of the alleged direct involvement of the Congress leader Kamal Nath in developing the ‘Hindu-Terror’ narrative. In an hour-long video  released by RVS Mani, he talks about the details of Congress’ alleged interference in Ishrat Jahan encounter case and the amount of pressure exerted by the Congress leadership to implicate Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the encounter case. RVS Mani also details how the Congress tried to concoct the “Hindu terror” bogey in a systematic manner. According to RVS Mani, Kamal Nath had met him in Urban Development Ministry, had allegedly asked RVS Mani to change the narrative of the Ishrat Jahan encounter case to implicate Narendra Modi, who at that time was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and further the Hindu terror narrative. The narration claims that there was pressure on him to declare Ishran Jahan as an innocent, so as to implicate Narendra Modi in her ‘encounter’. RVS Mani has claimed that Kamal Nath, who was accompanied by two other officers, requested him to alter the facts of the matter, but RVS Mani then had insisted to present the facts and refused to indulge in falsifying any evidence. The reply by Kamal Nath to RVS Mani’s statements, if believed to be true is rather shocking. According to the Mani, Kamal Nath offensively replied, “Bahar log Rahul Gandhi ka peshaab peeney ke liye thayar hai, aap itna chota kaam nahi kar sakte ho?

409,OpIndia Staff,"Amid never-ending attacks  by Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale deal, Dassault Aviation has been trying  to clear the air about the deal and clarify the allegations made about the same. As part of that, Dassault Aviation CEO tried to answer some questions in an interview given to AFP (Agence France-Presse, a France based international news agency). While answering why the company chose Reliance over HAL as their JV partner, CEO Eric Trappier says that Dassault Aviation wanted to establish a long-term presence in India through Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL), which will be led by an Indian CEO and a French COO. He also mentions that Dassault will maintain technical and industrial control over the operations in the plant, which will make parts for Falcon and Rafale aircraft. Demolishing claims made by Rahul Gandhi that Reliance is getting Rs 30,000 crore from the deal, Eric informs that Dassault will be able to fulfil about 10% of its offset obligation through DRAL. It is important to note that the total offset obligation in the Rafale deal is around Rs 29,000 core, but Dassault does not have to fulfil this obligation alone. There are four major companies involved in this deal, other than Dassault they are Thales (radar and electronics), Safran (engine) and MBDA (missiles), and all of them have offset obligations. According to reports, Dassault’s share in the offset obligation is around Rs 8,400 crore. This means the share of DRAL in the deal will be around Rs 840 crore, not Rs 30,000 crore as Rahul Gandhi is claiming. Eric also tried to clear the confusion created by the misleading report published by Mediapart. Quoting this report, Rahul Gandhi had alleged that Narendra Modi is ‘compensating’ Anil Ambani by paying him Rs 30,000 crore. He explains that the English word “offset” is generally written as “compensation” or “contrepartie”, and the mention of “compensation” in the report refers to offset only. He also clarifies that offset obligation is a mandatory requirement as per Indian law, but the choice of partner to implement that obligation is with Dassault. We have reproduced the English translation  of the interview below:  To clarify matters, what is called “offset” in English is usually translated into French as “compensation” or “contrepartie”. The reference is the contract we signed and which is called “ Signing an offset contract is a requirement of Indian law (Defence Procurement Procedure). The implementation of offsets is an obligation and, under the Indian regulation, the choice of the partners belongs to us. In full compliance with this regulation, Dassault Aviation therefore decided to set up the DRAL joint venture with Reliance and build a plant in Nagpur, which should enable us to meet about 10% of these offset obligations. We are in negotiations with about a hundred Indian companies and partnerships have already been concluded with about thirty of them.  Dassault Aviation decided to establish a long-term presence in India through DRAL, a joint enterprise in which governance is provided by an Indian Chief Executive Officer and a French Chief Operating Officer. Dassault Aviation therefore exercises technical and industrial control over the operations, applying its standards and its flexibility. This JV will produce parts for the Falcon 2000 and Rafale. The choice of the Nagpur site, in central India, was dictated by the availability of land with direct access to an airport runway.  Controversies are always unfortunate but we remain calm. Things are progressing rapidly. We set up DRAL on 10 February 2017 and the plant project was officially launched on 27 October 2017. The first phase of the project involves building a temporary hangar to house the production tool and enable staff training to begin as rapidly as possible. This temporary hangar was completed in March 2018. Activities started on 18 April in the presence of senior executives from Dassault Aviation and the local authorities. We hired an Indian CEO, Mr. Sampathkumaran S. T., who has more than 20 years’ experience in the aeronautical industry. We have hired and trained Indian managers and workers. The first Falcon 2000 parts should roll off the line at the end of the year. A second phase started in July 2018, with the construction of a final building, completion being scheduled for July 2019. This building will allow a ramp-up in industrial activities. The cooperation between Dassault and India, which has existed for 65 years, has been given fresh impetus by Make in India and we are proud to be able to contribute to it.",2018-10-12,"Dassault Aviation,Rafale,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies",Dassault CEO demolishes lies of Rahul Gandhi about the Rafale Deal,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/dassault-ceo-demolishes-lies-of-rahul-gandhi-about-the-rafale-deal/
410,OpIndia Staff,"Gujarat Congress leader and MLA Alpesh Thakor, who according to reports  was involved in instigating violence against non-Gujaratis, will be sitting on a ‘Sadbhavna Upvas’, to establish “peace and harmony”. He accused social media of creating panic among non-Gujaratis in the state. He also said that he doesn’t support regionalism. We had reported  some speeches in which Alpesh Thakor was heard saying  “all these outsiders who come here, they commit a crime here which has led to an increase in gundagardi”. He had also issued a deadline for all non-Gujaratis to leave the state. He and his Thakor Sena is demanding for 80% reservation of jobs for local people and attacking establishments that employ people from other states. Members of Congress have been caught  giving deadlines to leave the state or face consequences. This had caused  an exodus of migrant workers from Gujarat to their respective native states. According to reports thousands of people have already fled the state. CM Rupani had later, assured all migrant workers of safety and had called for their return. Earlier Alpesh Thakor had made another bizarre claim regarding the exodus of non-Gujaraties from Gujarat. He had said that people from other states were leaving Gujarat for Chhath puja. Fact is this year the Chhath puja is in the second week of November, and people have started leaving Gujarat in the first week of October, means if they don’t return till the puja, they will be not attending work for at least one and a half month. Which private sector industry grants such long leave to so many people? Even for vendors and shopkeepers, it is a very long absence from their business which will seriously hamper their earnings. Many members of his Thakor Sena have been arrested  by police in relation to the violence that ensued in Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Patan and Ahmedabad districts, following reports of rape of a baby girl by the migrant worker from Bihar.

411,OpIndia Staff,"Today Rahul Gandhi organised a press  conference in which he indicted PM Modi of corruption in the Rafale fighter jets deal .  We have identified the statements he made in the presser and decided to fact-check on them one by one:- : Several Cabinet ministers of PM Modi have already come in open and spoken in detail about the inter-government Rafale deal with France. N Sitharaman , Ravi Shankar Prasad, Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh , Amit Shah , and Piyush Goyal  have all addressed media refuting the claims of corruption made by the Congress. In fact, Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that Congress renegotiated  the Rafale deal for bribes. Arun Jaitley had given an interview to ANI dismissing the ill-informed allegations made by the Congress President. The Finance Minister has also posted detailed explanations on Facebook. If senior BJP cabinet ministers have responded to the accusations, why is Rahul Gandhi lying about it? It may be because his allegations don’t hold water. There is no corruption case as of now , let alone a clear cut case of corruption against PM Modi. Yesterday, the Supreme Court refused  to issue a notice to the centre in connection with the Rafale deal. If there is a clear-cut case of corruption, why did the SC did not notice it and take a suo-moto cognizance on the same? The top court has also mentioned that allegations made by the petitioners are “inadequate and deficient”. Questioning N Sitharaman’s visit to France, Rahul has obliquely accused N Sitharaman of striking negotiations with the French authorities after the Rafale scam got exposed. According to the official  sources, Sitharaman is on her visit to France to hold wide-ranging talks with her French counterpart Florence Parly on ways to deepen strategic cooperation between the two countries and the two sides will also deliberate on major regional and global issues of mutual interests. In their talks, Sitharaman and Party are expected to deliberate on joint production of military platforms and weapons by the two countries. She will also take the stock of progress in the supply of Rafale jets. Ministers routinely visit other nations for bilateral and multilateral meets and alleging corruption in that is hilarious. Rahul Gandhi himself undertakes so many journeys overseas, detail of most of them remain unknown to the public. The Defence Ministry has also issued a statement that the trip was postponed twice in the past before the dates being finalised on 7th September 2018 and hence, the speculations and allegations don’t hold up. The France government has already denied  any discussion on this topic took place between Rahul Gandhi and Emmanuel Macron. They also had confirmed that the Rafale deal comes under the confidentiality clause of the security agreement signed between the two nations. Interestingly, earlier Rahul Gandhi had claimed that Macron had said to him there is no secret clause in the deal and PM Modi can disclose details. Now he has changed his argument saying the price is not included in the secrecy clause. At last, he has accepted the existence of the clause. Rahul Gandhi has alleged that former French president Hollande told him in private that they were left with no options and the Indian government wanted to go ahead with Anil Ambani. However, the French government clarified  that they were not involved in choosing the defence partners and that the French companies have full independence to do so. The Indian Government had already dismissed Hollande’s earlier claim as false. We have already reported  how French publication has misinterpreted the comments of deputy CEO of Dassault. While talking to a labour union, he was explaining that there is a mandatory offset obligation in the deal and therefore Dassault is setting up a plant in India. This was misinterpreted as Reliance being made mandatory partner. Now Rahul Gandhi has added his own interpretation in the allegation, bringing in PM’s name and the word ‘compensation’. He has focused on the word, but the French publication has used the term to mean ‘offset’, which is part of the deal. They are not talking compensating Ambani for anything, because in French the word also means offset. Citing an internal document of Dassault aviation Rahul Gandhi alleged that Indian Government forced them to choose Anil Ambani’s Reliance group as one of their offsets but refuting the allegations made by the senior executive of Rafale, Dassault on Wednesday had already denied allegations of being forced to make Anil Ambani’s Reliance group as offset partner. “This joint-venture, Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL), was created on February 10, 2017. Other partnerships have been signed with other companies such as BTSL, DEFSYS, Kinetic, Mahindra, Maini, SAMTEL,… Other negotiations are ongoing with hundred-odd other potential partners,” Dassault said in a press release. Rahul Gandhi is still yet to prove malfeasance by any government official involved in the Rafale deal but he is now accusing the entire Defence Ministry of being involved in corruption. Without furnishing any proof or even a shred of evidence, Rahul has accused the ministry of being involved in corruption. It is clear that Rahul Gandhi, through his presser, is more interested in politicising the issue rather than genuinely pursuing the case for detecting corruption. Whatever he has claimed in the presser are either open-ended accusations or downright lies.",2018-10-11,"Congress,Congress lies,fact check,modi government,Narendra Modi,rafale deal,Rafale jets,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies",Rahul Gandhi’s press conference: Shameless name calling and a host of oft repeated lies,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/rahul-gandhis-press-conference-shameless-name-calling-and-a-host-of-oft-repeated-lies/
412,K Bhattacharjee,"The past few days have yielded a few bizarre news with absurd headlines by some reputed media outlets. A couple of decades ago, even 5-10 years ago, such articles would never have seen the light of day. Here, we will take a look at these articles. One such article  by Alex Regan for the BBC was headlined “Should women be spelt womxn?” The article reports on the backlash faced by an organization over the use of ‘womxn’ from hundreds of women. Wellcome Collection, a museum and library at London, used the weird spelling in a tweet promoting its event. When it faced a backlash, it explained that it used the spelling because “we feel that it is important to create a space/venue that includes diverse perspectives”. The Urban Dictionary defines  womxn as “A spelling of “women” that is a more inclusive, progressive term that not only sheds light on the prejudice, discrimination, and institutional barriers womxn have faced, but to also show that womxn are not the extension of men but their own free and separate entities. More intersectional than womyn because it includes trans-women and women of colour.” The use of ‘Womxn’ and ‘Womyn’ began with the advent of postmodernism and its efforts to make the language less patriarchal. The word for the female sex containing ‘men’ was seen as an instrument of patriarchy. As per Gwendolyn Wu , a student at the University of California, “Womyn” and “womxn” are two of the most commonly used substitutes to avoid using the suffix “-men” at the end of the term, but others like “wimmin,” “wimyn,” and “womin” are also sometimes used.” In an article  on Kafila by guest author Sayantan Dutta, one can see that such ideas have also been imported to India. As per a note to the article, “The author believes that the structure of language has mirrored the patriarchal structure of the society, and therefore they practices aungendering mechanism persynally by neutralizing gendered roots of some words.” The author does not limit himself to women but uses weird spellings for every word whose spellings contain words that refer to the masculine gender. Thus, the author spells personal as ‘persynal’, mention as ‘myntion’, harassment as ‘harassmynt’, vehemently as ‘vehemyntly’, moment as ‘momynt’, movements as ‘movemynts’ and disappointments as ‘disappointmynts’ but apparently forgets to spell manifestation as ‘mynifestation’ thus clearly showing that the author, as per his/her/xhe (I do not know ‘their’ personal pronoun preferences) has not escaped his/her/xhe patriarchal indoctrination. In a video published  by BBC again with the caption ‘What quantum physics taught me about queer identity’, Writer and performer Amrou Al-Kadhi (AKA Glamrou) speaks on the ‘inspiration to be found in a ‘beautiful, strange and glorious’ sect of physics.’ The speaker dressed garishly says at one point, “Quantum Physics to Newtonian Physics is, to me, what Queer Theory is to heteronormativity.” According to her, Quantum Physics shows that “Reality is just a set of contradictions with no real fixed foundations.” And that she is greatly comforted by Quantum Physics as a “Queer person with no real fixed identity”. Physicists might like to differ from her interpretation of Quantum Physics but it is unlikely that they will as no one wants to be labelled transphobic and exposed to unpleasant abuse if they can avoid it. A researcher and a Google scholar was, however, kind enough to point out the flaws in her logic. In a report by HuffPost headlined “Stephen Miller’s 3rd Grade Teacher Calls Him ‘A Strange Dude’ Who Ate Glue”, David Moye reports on comments made by Trump’s Immigration adviser Miller’s teacher. The report quotes  Nikki Fiske, Miller’s teacher when he was eight years old, telling The Hollywood Reporter, “Do you remember that character in Peanuts, the one called Pig Pen, with the dust cloud and crumbs flying all around him? That was Stephen Miller at 8. I was always trying to get him to clean up his desk — he always had stuff mashed up in there. He was a strange dude. I remember he would take a bottle of glue — we didn’t have glue sticks in those days — and he would pour the glue on his arm, let it dry, peel it off and then eat it.” HuffPost appears to have taken their opposition to Donald Trump and his administration to a whole new different level. I would guess that every one of us did pretty stupid things when we were eight years old but HuffPost appears to be making character judgments based on them. People on Twitter appear to agree that none of us would want our character or ability to be determined by things we did when we were kids. Some people also mentioned that the teacher should not be telling the media embarrassing stories about their students. Regardless of political inclination, I guess we could agree that we wouldn’t want our stories from 3rd to be part of the national news. But for HuffPost, it appears more decency than they are capable of.",2018-10-11,"BBC,Donald Trump,feminism,huffington post,LGBTQ,Radical Feminism,Trump haters,Western Feminism","Series of absurdities: ‘Womxn’, Quantum Physics and Queer Theory, and Trump adviser’s 3rd grade story",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/series-of-absurdities-womxn-quantum-physics-and-queer-theory-and-trump-advisers-3rd-grade-story/

414,OpIndia Staff,"On 6 October 2018, some excerpts of an upcoming book of Lt. General (Retd.) Zameeruddin Shah, “The Sarkari Mussalman” were published  which claimed that when riots broke out in Gujarat in February 2002 following the carnage of Sabarmati Express train where pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were burnt alive, the Gujarat government led by Narendra Modi failed to provide immediate transport to the Army, thereby delaying Army deployment in the riot-affected state. As per the reports, Lt. Gen Shah has claimed that he met Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat, with the then defence minister George Fernandes at 2 am in Ahmedabad on the intervening night of 28th February and 1st March. The Sabarmati Express was set on fire killing 59 people on 27th February 2002 following which the state was engulfed in one of the worst communal riots in the history of Gujarat. Lt. Gen. Shah claims that the “3,000 troops had landed at the Ahmedabad airfield at 7 am on 1st March but had to wait for a day before the Gujarat administration provided transport.” He says since the crucial time was lost, it led to more deaths in the state. Shah further writes that He claims that had Modi government would have provided necessary logistical support, the damage and loss to life would have been contained. He then claims that at such a crucial time, the arrangement of transport for Army troops could have been done faster. He even adds that the police were “dumb bystanders” while the “mob was setting fire on streets and houses”. Following the publication of this news, it was widely shared by people over social media. The truth, however, seems far from these claims. Following the Sabarmati Express carnage on 27th February 2002, where 59 pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were burnt alive, widespread riots broke out and escalated on 28th February. As reported by India Today in 18th March 2002 issue , Modi had called officially called for the Army by 4 pm on 28th February and by 6:30 pm a formal request for the Army landed in Delhi. On 1st March at 1 am, the then defence minister George Fernandes reached Ahmedabad and at 11:30 the Army was staging a flag march. The Hindu reported  on 1 March 2002 (Friday) that “The Army units, frantically called by the Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, as the situation seemed to slip out of hand, started arriving in Ahmedabad and are likely to be deployed in the city on Friday (1 March).” Another 1st March The Hindu report  from the front page says, The report further stated, Rediff report  from 1st March corroborated above claims of deployment of Army as well as shoot at sight orders on 1st March itself. The same fact is also reflected in the note submitted by ACS (Home), Ashok Narayan as part of the investigation. The note further states that in wake of the terrorist attack  on the Parliament in December 2001, there was a war-like situation on the border. Hence, the whole force was deployed in the forward/border areas of the country. The state government then requested for Army personnel in the cantonment of Ahmedabad, but no force was available there either. Despite the fact that in such a scenario, withdrawing the Army from the border would require a high-level decision at the Centre, the decision to withdraw the same and deploy to Gujarat was taken without delay. The note says Army personnel were airlifted by using about 40 aircrafts from the border and landed in Ahmedabad by 28th February midnight. 6 buses, 9 trucks and 15 jeeps were sent for use by the Army by 2:30 am on 1st March 2002. During the day 39 additional vehicles were provided. A total of 131 vehicles were provided to the Army. Additional executive magistrates were provided to the Army. Escort officers from the police force were provided to the Army. Personnel were airlifted to be deployed to Vadodara and Rajkot as well. Contradicting Lt. Gen. Shah’s claims, the note further states that the deployment of Army started in the early hours of 1st March and by 11 am, the Army had already started reaching some of the affected areas in the city. The report further states that while parts of the state like Bhavnagar and Surat were initially unaffected by violence, riots soon started there as well. Following which, the Army was deployed there as well on subsequent days. At the peak of deployment, as many as 26 Army columns were deployed in the state. Finally, once the law and order improved, it was decided that Army is sent by 10th March 2002. However, considering the situation in Ayodhya, the Army was kept on standby. Following incidents of violence in Surat and Vadodara later, Army was again deployed there and on 15th March, the Army held a flag march. To summarise, first oral communication was made to the Army on 27th February itself and the state was informed that no personnel were available for internal security duties. Within 16 hours of official communication, the Army was brought from forward/border areas and deployed in Gujarat, thereby completely refuting Lt Gen Zameeruddin Shah’s claims. Brother of actor Naseeruddin Shah, Lt. Gen. Zameeruddin Shah was appointed  as the vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University in 2012, under the UPA. As vice chancellor of AMU had rejected  demands of girls to access the Maulana Azad Library by reportedly saying that there would be ‘four times more boys’ in the library if girls are around. Since Times of India reported the incident, Lt. Gen. Shah banned  Times of India on the campus. : The article has been compiled with help from Gujaratriots.com .",2018-10-12,"2002 riots,Ahmedabad,Army,communal riots,George Fernandes,godhra riots,gujarat,Gujarat Riots,Narendra Modi,Sabarmati",Charges by Lt Gen (Retd.)

415,OpIndia Staff,"Two separate petitions filed by senior Congress leaders Kamalnath and Sachin Pilot seeking orders to the Election Commission to provide the draft voter list in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in text format were quashed  by the Supreme Court on Friday. Senior advocates Abhishek M Singhvi and Kapil Sibal represented the petitioners in the court. The petition claimed that there were a large number of duplicate voters on the voters’ list and urged the Supreme Court to make the voters’ list available in text format to ease scanning of names in the list. In their petition, the Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Pilot had claimed that as many as 60 lakh names on the voter list in Madhya Pradesh were duplicate and that they had also presented the case before the Election Commission along with other senior leaders in the State in that regard.  In addition to this, the petitions filed also implored for VVPAT slips to be verified with votes counted in at least 10 percent randomly selected polling stations in each Assembly constituency/ Assembly segment. Representing the Election Commission, Senior advocate Vikas Singh stated that a large number of duplicate entries from the voters’ list were already weeded out by the EC without this issue being taken up by the Congress party. The order was passed by a Bench of justices AK Sikri and Asok Bhushan. The apex court had reserved its verdict on October 8 on the petition of leaders alleging duplication of voters in the list and sought a proper redressal of grievances to ensure free and fair elections. In the past too, the Supre Court had rapped Congress on the knuckles for filing frivolous petitions. Just a week back, in a Supreme Court hearing of this case, the Election Commission had accused  Congress leaders of fabricating the voters’ list. In another hearing of the same case on October 8, the Election Commission alleged that Congress was using forged documents to undermine the integrity of the EC.

416,OpIndia Staff,"Controversy erupted last night  after French publication Mediapart reported to have obtained an internal document pertaining to Dassault Aviation which purportedly claims that the offset deal with Reliance was mandatory for the company to get the contract to supply the 36 Rafale fighter planes to India. In this regard, the French Aviation company issued  a clarification reiterating their stand that as per the agreement, Dassault Aviation had committed to offsets worth 50% of the total value of the purchase in India. For this, the company, Dassault Aviation got into a joint venture with India’s Anil Ambani led Reliance Defence, Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) on 27th February 2017. Dassault clarifies that other partnerships have also been signed with other companies like BTSL, DEFSYS, Kinetic, Mahindra, Maini, SAMTEL and negotiations are on for other companies. The DRAL manufacturing plant in Nagpur, the foundation of which was laid in October 2017, will manufacture parts for Falcon 2000 business jets and, in a second step, parts for Rafale aircraft and the first Falcon 2000 parts are to be delivered by end of 2018. Rafale deal is a government to government deal between India and France, and this deal has an offset clause as per India’s offset policy. According to this policy, the foreign vendor has offset 50% of the deal value in India. The offset may in the form of investment in India, purchase from India, and technology transfer. The Mediapart report mentions that while inaugurating the Dassault Reliance Aerospace facility in Nagpur, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation Loik Segalen is reported to have said that ‘It was imperative and mandatory for Dassault Aviation to accept this counterpart (offset partnership), in order to seal the deal to sell Rafale jet to India’. Mediapart seems to have either deliberately or inadvertently misinterpreted the comment. OpIndia has already reported  that Dassault has entered into offset partnerships  with several companies from both private and public sector India, including BEL, DRDO, HAL, BTCL, Samtel, Reliance Defence, L&T, Mahindra Group etc. The French company has signed MoUs with 72 companies for various offset agreements and talking with more. All this because of Dassault’s commitment to offsets worth 50% of the total purchase value in India. Other than Dassault, engine maker Safran, radar and aviation electronics supplier Thales, and missile provider MBDA also will have to fulfil offset obligations and they are also in the process of entering into such partnerships. Hence it is clear that the Dassault official meant offsets partnerships as a whole, which was essential for the company to get the deal of 36 fighter jets and not just Reliance. French journalist Julien Bouissou clarified that what the Dassault Aviation officer said was more for the French trade unions, explaining why Dassault is opening a manufacturing plant in Nagpur and not in France. He said that as per French labour laws, the top management of the company needs to inform  the Central Works Council (trade unions) about strategic and important decisions. He added that in this case, it was important to convey the decision of shifting the plant to Nagpur, India out of France, leading to no job creation for French workers. Earlier, this same publication had claimed that former France President Hollande had said that India had selected Reliance for the deal, but this claim was denied  by both the governments and the company. Later when Hollande asked to comment on it, he had said  that only Dassault can comment. The Mediapart seem to be extensively using arguments made by the opposition in India in its report. The report quotes Arun Shourie, Prashant Bhushan, Yashwant Sinha, persons who are among the biggest critics of the government at present. The report claims that Modi government cancelled the deal to buy 126 jets, ignoring the fact that the deal was stalled for over two years due to disagreement over HAL between Dassault and the Indian government. The report by Mediapart also repeats the lie spread by Congress that Reliance Defence was formed twelve days before PM Modi’s France visit. Fact is Pipavav Shipyard was established in 1997 which was acquired by Reliance in 2015 and was renamed as Reliance Defence and Engineering in 2016. The report also claims Anil Ambani is unknown in the defence industry. Fact is Reliance Defence is a known name in the industry and they have just won a deal  worth ₹ 15,000 crore billion to maintain the warships of the seventh fleet of US Navy, among many other deals. 7th fleet is the largest fleet of the US Navy and its fleet size and firepower is actually more than entire Indian navy. The report by the French journal actually reads more like a Rahul Gandhi speech than an investigative report, going by how many times they mention Anil Ambani’s name, not forgetting to inform that he is ‘close friend’ of Narendra Modi.",2018-10-11,"anil ambani,Congress,Congress lies,Dassault Aviation,lies,Media Lies List,Rafale,Rafale jets,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,reliance defence","Dassault clarifies again, it freely chose Reliance, there was no pressure or mandatory requirement",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/dassault-clarifies-again-it-freely-chose-reliance-there-was-no-pressure-or-mandatory-requirement/
417,OpIndia Staff,"We have reported  earlier on the violence that has erupted in Gujarat against non-Gujaratis following the rape of a 14-month old infant. Many migrants were reported to have fled the state in wake of the targeted violence against them. Gujarat Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja was forced  to appeal to those who have left to come back asserting that the situation had been brought under control. Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while speaking at poll-bound Rajasthan, spoke on the matter and used the spate of violence to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is quite hypocritical of Rahul Gandhi to attack Narendra Modi over the matter as the violence was reportedly perpetrated by those associated with the Congress party. The Police in Gujarat had confirmed  that Congress leaders had instigated violence against non-Gujaratis in the state. Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor was himself seen in videos  instigating mobs to commit acts of violence. Furthermore, members of Alpesh Thakor led Thakor Sena were arrested  by the Police in connection with the violence that ensued. If that wasn’t bad enough, the Congress MLA has announced  that he will sit on an indefinite fast from the 11th of October demanding the withdrawal of charges against the riot accused and the immediate release of those arrested by the Police. Under such circumstances, it is extremely dishonest of Rahul Gandhi to attack Prime Minister Modi over an incident where Congress leaders are known to have been involved. A Congress MLA is even batting for the riot accused.

He even said that Alpesh Thakor should not be held responsible for the violence.

420,Jinit Jain,"The result of the upcoming elections in 5 states whose dates have been recently announced  by the Election Commission is going to be a vital plank on which different political parties would like to mount their strategies for the approaching decisive Loksabha 2019 battle. Madhya Pradesh Congress has, therefore, started  its poll preparation by attempting to woo Hindu voters by staging another temple run for Rahul Gandhi. If banners are anything to go by, Congress has taken a decisive shift in Madhya Pradesh by projecting its PM candidate Rahul Gandhi as ‘Shiv Bhakt’, ‘Ram Bhakt’ and ‘Narada Bhakt’ simultaneously in order to pander to the differing sects under the overarching fold of Hinduism. Tending to depart from their usual hack, the Congress party didn’t invoke secularism as their election campaign in MP kickstarts. Congress struck with its projection of Secularism from 2003 to 2018 but remaining out of power for the last 15 years has taught them a thing or two. In 2003, under Digvijaya Singh, the party had brought ‘Habib Tanveer’ to stage ‘Poonga Pandit’ throughout the state. The party lost terribly even as the BJP accused them of disparaging Hindus and instigating communal riots by demeaning Hindu pandits through ‘Poonga Pandit’. Their strategy didn’t change much in 2008 and 2013 resulting in their embarrassing losses against the BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chauhan on both the occasions. Congress has promised to develop MP into a religious hub if voted to power. Senior Congress Minister and their alleged CM candidate Kamal Nath said, “BJP uses religion only for political gain but Congress will truly develop the state into a religious tourism hub.” A senior Congress leader said, “In last 5 years Rahul Gandhi has learned to answer the BJP in its language. He is actively countering BJP’s Hindutva with more Hindutva. No one can now say he is an anti-Hindu. He is strategically attacking Narendra Modi not only on the issues of corruption, inflation, and unemployment but also on Hindutva.” According to the sources, Rahul Gandhi is going to embark on a ‘Holy Trail’ in MP, starting from Chitrakoot after offering puja at Kamtanath Temple. Rahul Gandhi is supposed to follow the path that Lord Ram took while he was in exile. The Congress delegation under Harishankar Shukla with sadhus is presently tracking the route. Congress would do well to not underestimate the intelligence of the people of Madhya Pradesh. Earlier, in past, when Rahul Gandhi went on a temple spree in Gujarat and Karnataka and China, his blatant attempt to feign saffronisation was debunked and his campaigns were marred with controversies. On visiting Somnath Temple in Gujarat, Congress President Rahul Gandhi registered  his name under the non-Hindu column. In another instance, just a week back, Rahul Gandhi’s party expelled  a party worker for chanting “Har Har Mahadev”. Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi are also accused of corruption in the National Herald  case and are currently out on bail.",2018-10-10,"Congress,Hinduism,Janeu Dhari,Lord Shiva,madhya pradesh assembly elections,Pappu,pseudo intellectuals,rahul gandhi,temple Run,UPA",Congress plans another temple run for Rahul Gandhi ahead of polls in Madhya Pradesh,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/congress-plans-another-temple-run-for-rahul-gandhi-ahead-of-polls-in-madhya-pradesh/
421,OpIndia Staff,"Congress IT cell head, Divya Spandana’s name has been named  up in a charge sheet that was filed on Friday in the Congress sexual harassment case , in which a former party worker had accused the right-hand man of social media chief Divya Spandana of molestation at the workplace. She had also alleged that Spandana had not taken any action, but instead had “mentally harassed” her. The court took cognizance of the case on Friday and summoned the accused Chirag Patnaik. Patnaik was arrested  in July on the charges of 354A and 509 on accusations of him of breaching the woman’s personal space and indulging in immoral behaviour. He was later released on bail. The charge sheet describes how Congress social media cell in-charge Divya Spandana refused to entertain the complainant’s grave allegations against Chirag Patnaik of frequent misbehaviour. She also called out Divya and accused her of displaying arrogant and apathetic attitude rendering the workplace intolerable for her to continue. She cited ‘psychological reasons’ for resigning. In the charge sheet, the victim has, in excruciating details, alleged that Patnaik violated her personal space at work “by coming too close to me on the pretext of checking tweets”. She further accused that Patnaik “exhaled into my breathing space whenever he encircled me from behind in an immoral manner.’ The victim also accused Chirag of “gazing at the contours of her body” in a lascivious manner. The victim had joined the social media cell of the Congress on the March 5  as ‘social media manager’ and was entrusted the responsibility of running the official Twitter account of the Indian National Congress (@INCIndia) and its communications handle (@INCSandesh). In an interview to MyNation, she said , “The period between May 17 and May 24 was marked with mental harassment. Despite knowing I was disturbed, Miss Spandana did not correct her behaviour towards me. She humiliated me with insulting work-related messages on the official group for no fault of mine. My professionalism and manners were also questioned.

422,OpIndia Staff,"The #MeToo movement which began with Utsav Chakraborty from All India Bakchod being exposed  as a pervert has already claimed the careers of multiple alleged sexual predators in journalism and the stand-up comedy scene. Allegations have also surfaced against BJP MP M.J. Akbar who is accused to have used his position to exploit women during his years as the editor of a newspaper. The Congress party was quick to latch on the allegations against Akbar and grasped the opportunity to take a dig at External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj for refusing to answer questions posed by some journalists regarding the same. Through its official Twitter handle, the Congress asserted that shielding sexual predators is in BJP’s DNA. But now, people are questioning the Congress party’s own conduct in matters of safety for women in the workplace. A letter has been addressed to party president Rahul Gandhi demanding that he take urgent action against NSUI President Fairoz Khan and explain the sham investigation regarding allegations against Chirag Patnaik who was involved with the party’s IT cell. In her letter to Rahul Gandhi, Gunja Kapoor states, “While certain organizations have already dealt with those outed, we are yet to see your party take any action on two people who have been recently accused of sexual harassment in the recent past.” She then proceeds to ask why were the accused not forced to step down from their position or sent on a leave of absence to felicitate a free and fair inquiry. One of the accused mentioned in Kapoor’s letter, Chirag Patnaik, has been arrested  by the Delhi Police on the charges of sexual harassment levelled against him by a former colleague. The victim had claimed  that she had reported the matter to Rahul Gandhi and IT cell head Divya Spandana and yet no action was taken against the accused. Furthermore, she claims it led to even more harassment. She had further asserted that she knew the committee formed to investigate the matter would be biased. It is pertinent to mention that Divya had come in defence  of the now arrested Patnaik and blamed the victim instead. The other person mentioned in Kapoor’s letter, Fairoz Khan, was accused  by a woman member of NSUI that he was using abetting women of the organization to have sexual relationships with him in lieu of political posts.

423,Abhishek Banerjee,"Generally speaking, when governments want things, they can just snatch them away. But you can’t do that too much, or you might invite a public uprising. Especially when your objective is to seize somebody’s religion by force. There is a second, more roundabout approach which our ‘democratic’ Indian state uses to take matters of Hindu religion into its own hands. Directly taking over Hindu temples and crushing them might look bad. So you seize the temple and hand over the keys to a “Board”. The “Board” is a quasi-government organization that will have some measure of independence. On paper. As days pass, the ruling party and its cronies take over the Board, one tiny rule at a time. The Board works on the inside to hollow out the character of the temples and strip them of their Hindu character until there is nothing left. In Kerala, this job is carried out by the so-called Devaswom Board. Observe here one little baby step by the Communist government of Kerala to pickpocket Hindus. This extract from a July 6, 2018 notification from the Government of Kerala recently started to go viral on the internet. As you can see, the notification removes the requirement that the Devaswom Board should be headed by a Hindu! Issued in July 2018 and came to notice only in October. Which means they really thought they were getting away with it. Much annoyed CNN-News18 reports  that “BJP and other Parivar outfits stoked a controversy” over this issue. Observe how the blame is shifted to the BJP, with its grand total of 0 MPs and 1 MLA from Kerala, while the ruling Communist government of the state gets a free pass. And CNN-News18 goes on further to state that: Oh, it was just a ‘confusion’.  A teeny tiny oversight by the government of Kerala. Those poor babies might make a mistake or two now and then, but rest assured that their hearts were always made of gold. Can we ever forgive the BJP and other Parivar outfits for stoking a controversy over a mistake made by the little angels who run the Kerala government? This is the same sensationalist Indian media that can discern a Hindutva hand behind almost anything. Remember how Modi was caught trying to take over Christmas by celebrating Atalji’s birthday, which coincidentally also happens to be on Dec 25? Deep-rooted conspiracy on part of Atalji in choosing to be born on that day. Every day, the media and opposition uncover another conspiracy by BJP to undermine Muslims in India, from Modi not wearing a skull cap to not wearing enough green outfits. Remember when the New York Times discovered a Hindutva conspiracy behind the textile ministry promoting handloom sarees and even minister Smriti Irani’s personal choice to wear sarees? No, all that was hard-hitting journalism. A crystal clear notification from the government of Kerala removing the requirement that the Devaswom Board must be headed by a Hindu? Well, that’s just a ‘confusion’. The notification came in July. It is October now. The Kerala Government now says that it was just a mistake. And considering the kind of clout that Communists enjoy in our media, they will most likely get the benefit of the doubt. In fact, hardly any mainstream media, at least in the English language, even reported this event. Imagine if a ‘mistake’ like this had happened with respect to another religion. This reminds me of another horrendous ‘mistake’ made by the Government of Kerala some years ago. At the time in 2013, it was minor children who were at the losing end of that one. The circular allowed child marriage in the Muslim community in Kerala based on a mysterious “Muslim Marriage Act, 1957.” The only problem ? No such “Muslim Marriage Act, 1957” exists in India! The “Muslim Marriage Act, 1957” based on which the govt of Kerala issued a circular exists in Jamaica, not India! Another ‘confusion’. Shame on anybody who tried to stoke a controversy over this. When the British were taking over India, they didn’t actually fight that many wars. Instead, they signed networks of treaties all over India, installed puppet rulers who gave them special trading rights and created a patronage network to suck out the wealth of the country. In India, the government uses the same methods to suck the life force out of Hindu society. And there are two things that the Indian state is particularly good at. Oppressing Hindus as a community and oppressing Muslim girls and women. Both for the benefit cum appeasement of Islamic patriarchy.",2018-10-10,"anti hindu,CNN-News18,Communist,Hinduism,Journalism,Journalist bias,journalistic ethics,Kerala,Kerala politics,Media,media bias,minority appeasement,Muslim Appeasement,Pinarayi Vijayan,The Hindu",Did Kerala’s Communist Government try to pickpocket Hindus?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/did-keralas-communist-government-try-to-pickpocket-hindus/
424,OpIndia Staff,"Union Minister of State for External Affairs and former editor of The Telegraph, M.J. Akbar, has been accused  of sexual harassment by multiple people online in India’s version of #MeToo movement that is currently going on. In what appears to be a pattern, Akbar is alleged to have interviewed female journalists in hotel rooms, asking them to sit on the bed and making them feel extremely uncomfortable. One of the first allegations against Akbar was made by journalist Priya Ramani. In an article  for Vogue in 2017, Ramani wrote that a particular editor invited her for an interview to his flat. During the interview, she was offered a drink and the editor sang old Hindi songs to her after inquiring about her music preferences. She wrote, “You’re an expert on obscene phone calls, texts, inappropriate compliments and not taking no for an answer. You know how to pinch, pat, rub, grab, and assault. Speaking up against you still carries a heavy price that many young women cannot afford to pay. Sometimes you are inconvenienced when the stories get out and you are asked to take a time out.” It was only during the #MeToo storm brought about by the expose of Utsav Chakraborty and other comedians and journalists that Ramani confirmed that she was referring to Akbar. Since then, multiple people have come forward with their allegations against M.J. Akbar. Writer Prerna Singh Bhindra accused  him of making her life hell at work and passing lewd remarks at her. Journalist Harminder Baweja remarked that many journalists are sure to have an ‘MJ’ story. Ghazala Wahab, in an article  for The Wire, described in vivid detail the horror that she allegedly went through working for the Asian Age under Akbar. She claims that she was sexually harassed on an extremely regular basis and that Akbar even used psychological tactics to coerce her into having his way with her physically. She says that she was called to Akbar’s room every day and he would make attempts to paw at her and touch her inappropriately. Eventually, she had to quit her job to escape the terror that she was experiencing at work. She also remarks, “I also frequently heard office gossip about his affairs with sub-editors/ reporters or that in every regional office of the  Another freelance journalist, Kanika Gahlaut, who has worked with Akbar in the past describes a similar pattern of behaviour. She told  The Indian Express, “One did hear, from the beginning, from before we joined that MJ (Akbar) had a glad eye, and we were forewarned”. Akbar “did it to everyone,” she said. She further said that she was invited to a hotel by Akbar as well. But since she was aware of Akbar’s reputation for sexual misconduct, she agreed to come but did not show up. She later made an excuse and claims that he never bothered her and never had to face any consequences. The allegations against M.J. Akbar are serious and demand further investigation into the matter. If found to be true, it speaks of a regular pattern of criminal behaviour and he should have no place in any position of power.

As per reports, the candidates had filed  a petition against the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Board in the High Court following which the Court had ruled in favour of the applicants and directed the government to complete the recruitment process. However, as per reports, a review petition will soon be filed against the order by the state government. As per Jagran , there are currently 15800 Urdu teachers in Uttar Pradesh while students number at approximately 87000. Thus, the numbers indicate that there are 2 teachers for every 11 students. The state government considers that there are already more Urdu teachers than what is required and more teachers of the subject are not needed. The government is expected to make these arguments in the High Court in defense of its decision to scrap the recruitment process.",2018-10-10,"Akhilesh Yadav,samajwadi party,Urdu,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath,yogi sarkar",UP: Yogi Government cancels recruitment of 4000 Urdu teachers started during Akhilesh government,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/up-yogi-government-cancels-recruitment-of-4000-urdu-teachers-started-during-akhilesh-government/
426,OpIndia Staff,"India has seen several harrowing tales of sexual harassment  surface recently. After comedians and actors, women started outing powerful Editors and colleagues from the media fraternity. In fact, some even stepped down from their posts. Now, a former employee of Congress mouthpiece National Herald has spoken up narrate her tale of workplace harassment. She has written about how Pinaki Bhattacharya of the now-defunct Sunday Mail used to ask her if she wanted to have sex and how her complaint was shrugged off as something which is normal in newsrooms. She has also written about how Tarun Tejpal, who was protected by most of the left-liberals before he got caught in Goa like to kiss, hug or touch women employees. The now deceased Vinod Mehta had alleged caressed her hand constantly while interviewing her for a job. Interestingly, she has also accused Uttam Sengupta who is now the Editor of Congress mouthpiece National Herald. National Herald is owned by the Gandhi family  and is currently under ligitation for alleged scam perpetuated by the Gandhi family. Uttam Sengupta, the Editor of Gandhi family owned National Herald who befittingly calls himself “chatukhor” on Twitter allegedly harassed the victim. The victim has also alleged that she reported his harassment and intimidation tactics following which a “sham internal inquiry” took place at National Herald. Considering Uttam Sengupta still works at National Herald, no action was taken against him and the victim “left in disgust”. She has also asked whether Congress would now throw Uttam Sengupta out. Interestingly, Sengupta has been retweeting a bunch of #MeToo tweets recently but most of his colleagues, friends and Sengupta himself have kept quiet about these allegations against him. Not too long ago, Congress IT Cell member had also been accused of sexual harassment. The victim, in that case, had said that she did not expect justice from Divya Spandana,  the Congress IT Cell head. Divya had, in turn, had supported the accused wholly. It was only obvious that the so-called internal inquiry was set to be a sham. Chirag, the accused, was later arrested .

427,OpIndia Staff,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday led an 8-kilometre roadshow in the poll-bound Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur district. The event was a close squeak for the party president as a major fire was averted  as he waved at the crowd atop his open-roof vehicle. The incident  is said to have taken place at Model Road when the Congress’ cavalcade was passing through, as part of his road-show. Thousands of people were lined up along the main thoroughfare. As seen in the video below, a few Congress workers were holding an ‘aarti thali’ to welcome the Congress chief. In the brouhaha, some balloons which had been released as part of the celebrations, came in contact with the flame of lamp kept on the ‘aarti thali’. As a result, the balloons caught on fire and the gas inside the balloons created a big flash of fire for a moment. Though no injuries have been reported, the blast left the Congress chief spooked for a while. The police and SPG soon took control of the situation and pushed behind all the workers of the party and the procession continued, deflecting the predicament. Earlier too, the Congress president has evaded a somewhat similar situation. In 2016, Rahul who was on the Kisan Mahayatra in Uttar Pradesh had, had a narrow escape  when his head apparently came in contact with an electrical wire.

428,OpIndia Staff,"The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the dates for the assembly elections  in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Telangana. As soon as the election dates have been announced, it seems like a section of the media has gotten busy trying to sow discord by peddling lies and half-truth on social media. Two such incidents came to light today. Recently, large-scale violence has erupted at several places in Gujarat following the alleged rape of a 14-month-old girl in the state. Following the arrest of the perpetrator, attacks on people from Bihar and UP took place  in several places in the state including Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Patan and Ahmedabad districts in the last one week. The attacks were instigated by hate messages against people from UP and Bihar being circulated on social media. In this entire incident, Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor had raised the issue  of ‘non-Gujaratis’ while raising the issue of justice for the child who was brutalised. A mob of around 200 people, allegedly led by Thakor Sena members, attacked a factory near Vadnagar town of Mehsana district on October 2 and thrashed two employees. Similar violence has happened against people from Bihar and UP in many places in the state, either led by Thakor Sena members or people belonging to Thakor Community. While Alpesh Thakor has denied these charges, the Congress MLA and his men seem to be smack in the middle  of this violence. News surfaced  today that a mass exodus of North Indians is taking place from the affected areas. The Director-General of Police has reportedly said, “If people are leaving for home for a festival, it should not be seen otherwise. I have told my officers to visit residential areas, and if required, visit bus stands and railway stations and if people are found leaving due to fear, (then to) persuade them to come back.” However, a section of the media seems to have a tough time reporting the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. While reporting journalist Mahesh Langa wrote an article for The Hindu that finds no mention of the Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor inciting violence against non-Gujaratis in the state, which has now been confirmed  by the police. In an almost concerted effort, controversial Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam  who has in the past made distasteful comments multiple times shifted the blame of the violence on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that if people of UP, Bihar and MP are being beaten up and driven out of Gujarat, the Prime Minister should remember that he too has to return to Gujarat to seek votes. Interestingly, the fact that Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor was involved completely got lost in the rabblerousing. This same narrative was even furthered by The Wire  ‘journalist’ Rohini Singh who has been caught  furthering lies several times. She quoted a person who alleged that non-Gujaratis are being attacked in “Vibrant Gujarat” because of huge joblessness. Rohini Singh, in turn, quoted that tweet and asserted that people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar should remember this when “people from Gujarat” come to seek votes in 2019. Clearly, when Rohini Singh said “people from Gujarat” she was hinting at the Prime Minister who is from Gujarat. However, the staggering dishonesty displayed by Rohini Singh was all too glaring considering she, as a ‘journalist’, did not once mention that it was Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor who was in the middle of the violence that broke out in Gujarat.   In another incident, some ‘independent’ journalists  took to Twitter to add fuel to fire whole sowing discord in the society. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta shared a news article where a 90-year-old Dalit man was allegedly burnt alive while trying to enter a temple in Uttar Pradesh.   The same news was also shared by Saba Naqvi, another self-proclaimed ‘independent journalist’ who has been caught lying  several times. Interestingly, this news article  shared by both these ‘independent’ journalists on the same day is from 2015, when the state of Uttar Pradesh was ruled by Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party. This news about the 90-year-old too was fake news which was spread by the media. This story claimed that the Dalit man was killed because he entered a temple. This was subsequently picked up by various media outlets. But other media houses r eported that the Dalit man was in fact killed by a drunkard. They reported that the Dalit man was going to the temple when he was asked for money by a drunkard. When he refused, the drunkard hit him with an axe, and later burnt his body. This was also confirmed by the District Magistrate. Indian Express also confirmed the money angle and further reported that the deceased was, in fact, coming out of a temple and that to a temple built by members of the SC community. So the bogey raised by Hindustan Times was proved to be totally untrue. We had busted  this lie in 2015 itself. One wonders why an old news of 2015 which happened under the rule of Akhilesh Yadav was drudged up today and also, why a section of the media is towing Congress’ line in obfuscating the fact that Gujarat violence was allegedly incited by Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor and his men. With the race to 2019 general elections heating up and 5 states heading to polls before 2019, the media seems to be in overdrive to ensure that the crimes of the opposition are whitewashed while holding the Modi government and the mythical ‘rising intolerance under fascist regime’ responsible for every ill perpetuated or enabled by the players of the mahagathbandhan.",2018-10-08,"2018 Assembly Elections,2019 general elections,alpesh thakor,Anti Modi,Bihar,Caste Divide,Congress,Congress lies,Dalit violence,gujarat,Madhya Pradesh,Media Lies List,modi government,Narendra Modi,paranjoy guha thakurta,rahul gandhi,rohini singh,saba naqvi,Sanjay Nirupam,The Hindu,The Wire,Uttar Pradesh",How ‘independent’ journalists and Congress tried to fan discord after election dates were announced,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/how-independent-journalists-and-congress-tried-to-fan-discord-after-election-dates-were-announced/
429,OpIndia Staff,"As already reported  earlier, certain districts in Gujarat is facing widespread violence against non‑Gujaratis, mostly against people from Bihar and UP. The violence followed rape of a minor girl in a Thakor dominant village, after which a labourer from Bihar was arrested by police accusing him of the crime. After it was known that a person from Bihar has allegedly raped a Gujarati Thakor girl, it was reported that Kshatriya Thakor Sena instigated revenge violence against people from Bihar and UP working in the state, in various industries as well as people working as street vendors. The attacks were instigated by messages circulated in various social media networks. Following the attack, hordes of people from the two north Indian states have been leaving the state via buses and trains. The president of Kshatriya Thakor Sena is Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor, who has intensified the demand for reserving 80% jobs for locals in the state after the incident. To contain the violence, police have arrested over 300 people, most of whom belong the Thakor Sena. Alpesh Thakor had denied that Sena has instigated the violence, and had demanded that all arrested Sena members should be immediately released by the police. But now evidence  has come up which show that it is Thakor Sena leaders who have started the violence against non-Gujaratis. Earlier a video footage had emerged where a man was seeing threatening non-Gujaratis. Now, police have identified the person and confirmed that he is MV Thakore, a local leader of the Congress party and elected Taluka Panchayat member. Police have arrested three persons who were seen along with Thakore in the video, but MV Thakore himself is absconding. In the video, Thakore was seen threatening non-Gujarati people of massive violence if they don’t leave the state, and he had given them time till 9 PM on 8th October to do so. He says that after the deadline is over, he does not want to see anyone from Bihar and UP in his village. Everyone from Bihar and UP will have to leave, and they will come again to check, he adds. It is important to note that while the violence against non-Gujaratis is happening for almost a week now, it didn’t find much attention from national media like they cover other similar incidents. There is such a large-scale violence against mostly economically weaker people in a BJP ruled states, and it was a not a top news for media outlets. Perhaps the reason behind this is the instigators of the violence.

In a video which is believed to be from Becharaji, Gujarat, from last month, Alpesh could be heard saying, “all these outsiders who come here, they commit crime here which has led to increase in ‘goondagardi’. Villagers are beaten up and run off to their own hometown in other state after committing the crime. Is our Gujarat for such people?” Inciting people present there to take to violence, he said, “The trucks of these companies will be stopped and their doors will be broken.” He then asks people how many are in a mood to fight? “Containers will be stopped, trucks will be stopped, and if needed, we will burn tyres. In another video, he could be seen justifying violence. The above video is edited by Japan Pathak, who tweeted it to put relevant portions. Full video could be seen here . He says, “Our system of protest is very clear. We don’t take to violence, we don’t break the law.” In the same interview, he says, “If these companies (which invest in Gujarat) do not give 85% of the jobs to Gujaratis, then tyres will burn, trucks will be stopped and trucks will be broken. I believe we should fight aggressively and now that same Alpesh Thakore is getting into the field to play his cards. We will then see how these ‘lions’ are dragged on to the roads.” Adding how much he loves the colour of blood, he said, “We are going to put up an aggressive fight where you will be able to see blood on my white shirt. Because the red colour on your screen and that red colour is my identity. Along with that red and blue colour, we will lead a bloody protest.” The recent violence in Gujarat followed a rape of a minor girl in a Thakor dominant village, after which a labourer from Bihar was arrested by police accusing him of the crime.

434,Ashutosh Muglikar,"Politicians and land deals have a very close-knit connection. Usually, any scam or allegation somehow leads to a property. When top leaders of Indian National Congress  and Mr Robert Vadra  a “Private” citizen himself are involved in land scams (read deals) then it won’t take too much time for their party members (read followers) to follow suit. One such case has been in the news for a long time but has missed the attention of national media probably because the news is from a relatively small state. The current case  allegedly involves Mr Sachin Upadhyay, brother of a prominent State Congress leader,  Kishor Upadhyay and one Mr Mukesh Joshi. Thick in allegations flowing from multiple sides, the case takes strange twists and turns. At one point Mr Sachin Upadhyay is also alleged  to have locked Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority inside a room and they had to be rescued by the police. If you think this is strange, then read the chronological allegations being made by Mr Mukesh Joshi his estranged business partner. Here is a synopsis. The matter is related to activities in 3 Companies   SM hospitality was incorporated in 31/10/2006 by Mukesh Joshi and Sachin Upadhaya as equal shareholders, each holding 5000 equity shares of Rs 10 each. The objective of this venture was to construct a hotel. Mukesh Joshi and Sachin Upadhyay both have to bring in equal share of investment for the construction of the hotel. As per the understanding and the statement given by Mr Joshi in the matter filed before the Company Law Board, he gave a Loan of R.s 1.7 Crores to the company (SM Hospitality) for the purchase of land. Sachin Upadhyay, however, did not contribute his share of investment and kept delaying it on one pretext or another. Due to the stress caused by the non-fulfilment of promise by Sachin Upadhyay, apart from other harassment, Mukesh Joshi suffered a massive heart attack in October 2010 and was bedridden for more than one year. Allegedly, according to Mr Joshi, taking advantage of Mukesh Joshi’s medical condition Sachin Upadhyay, in blatant disregard of the Law of land and his fiduciary position as the director of the company, fraudulently with the intent to usurp the company and its properties filed various forms with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) to remove Mukesh Joshi from the post of director only to appoint his wife Nazia Yusuf Izuddin. He then proceeded to allot further 2,27,800 number of equity shares to himself in 18/02/2011 which is the same day when the appointment of Ms Nazia was approved. In essence, it is alleged that Sachin Upadhyay converted the debt in the books of the company which was introduced by Mukesh Joshi into equity shares. He then proceeded to allot the 2,27,800 equity shares to himself thereby diluting Joshi’s stake in the company. In fact, Form 32 for the appointment of Nazia and removal of Mukesh Joshi along with Form 2 were filed after a gap of 3.5 years (41 months) and on the same day. It is worthy to note here, that as per the documents filed by Sachin Upadhyay, Mr Mukesh Joshi had allegedly resigned from Directorship in 2007. However, in the year 2009, the documents filed by Sachin Upadhyay had the signature of Mr Joshi as the Director. The reader must recall that Mr Upadhyay has already conceded that the financial documents filed by him were fraudulent. It is alleged, that Upadhyay fabricated Joshi’s signature on the financial documents that were then retrospectively filed. In the year 2012, Joshi took the matter to Company Law Board (CLB). In 2012 itself, Joshi also filed an FIR against Upadhyay in the Economic Offences Wing. Realizing that their actions are bad in law both husband and wife agreed to enter into a compromise before the Company Law Board and entered into settlement dated 06.08.2013 before the CLB, wherein Sachin admitted that the Complainant (Mukesh Joshi) is holding 50% share in SM Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. In essence, Sachin Upadhyay agreed that his act of him allotting 2,27,800 shares to him and appointing his wife as the Director was incorrect and bad in law. The settlement deed dated 06.08.2013 was submitted by Sachin and the complainant before CLB and CLB vide its orders dated 16.09.2013 declared Complainant as 50% shareholder in SM Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. Sachin under a separate agreement hypothecated his 50% shareholding to the Complainant. Hence complainant owns total 100% shareholding of SM Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. Sachin Upadhyay and Nazia have no right left whatsoever in the same since 2013. The agreement between Sachin Upadhyay and Mukesh Joshi came into effect in 2013. Ideally, within a few days, Sachin Upadhyay should have taken steps to restore the directorship of Mukesh Joshi by removing his wife Nazia from the board. Further in line with the settlement deed, he should have paid Mukesh Joshi Rs. 2.65 crores as agreed and restore the ownership of the company to a 50-50 status.   However, according to Mukesh Joshi, Sachin Upadhyay did not take any concrete steps to honour the settlement deal and kept delaying the process under false pretexts. While Mukesh Joshi waited and pursued Sachin Upadhyay to make good the settlement agreement, Sachin Upadhyay proceeded to write another chapter of this alleged scam. Ideally, Sachin Upadhyay and his wife Nazia should have had no right to sell or mortgage any asset of the company. But, while Upadhyay kept delaying the agreement with Joshi, he hypothecated the property of the company SM Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. with a public financial institution like Punjab National Bank. By hypothecating the said properties, Upadhyay availed loan and credit facility to the tune of Rs. 39 crores from Punjab National Bank and 5.2 crores from other Financial Institutions. He had done exactly the same, with another company of theirs called SM Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. Prima facie, this entire transaction seems dubious and of an illegal nature and would point towards connivance between Upadhyay and officials of the bank. A keen look at these allegations shows that there are three aspects to this alleged fraud. Mr Joshi claims that he has filed various complaints at different forums against the said individuals. He has even approached the Central Vigilance Commission to take due notice of the apparent illegalities being done under the various companies. Mr Joshi also claims that Nazia and Sachin have duped scores of people by offering life membership of a club which has no legitimate existence. “Politicians and their kin are above law whole system collude to protect their interests and shield their crime.

435,Abhishek Banerjee,"On the internet and particularly on social media, the air is thick with allegations of gender-related crimes against the entire star cast of India’s liberal comedians. Some of them were outright predators, sending d*ck pics to women, including minor girls, over the internet. Almost everyone who is an insider on the circuit admits that they knew about these allegations for a long time and knew that they were quite credible. And that they went on collaborating with as well as promoting these people. What a coincidence that all the predators and their enablers have decided to “think” and “learn” at the exact moment when the dirt has come out in the open. Not surprisingly, the larger liberal left, including outspoken, placard-carrying liberal women, have decided that not just the specific predators but the entire race of men (whatever that means) are collectively to be blamed for the situation. This after spending the last four years of their lives holding Modi personally accountable for any abusive tweet against any woman by any person who may have ever expressed a pro-BJP view. For liberals, it is time to spread the blame instead of concentrating all of it against one man. The more they spread it out, the thinner it is supposed to get. Perhaps an inter-continental task force needs to be formed to make sure that the focus of blame is shifted away from the small gang of left-wing comedians? Yet other liberals wanted to “understand” these predators rather than punish them.  Of course, I think these people just want to rationalize the behaviour of their friends, but let’s indulge them anyway. Let us explain to these liberals how their “woke” icons got to be this way. Remember this? Remember how the victim told her story to anyone who would listen: See there? The same anguish that you can read in the words of the women who are now coming out and telling their stories of being sexually harassed by the “woke” comedians of the left. And he told her to get lost, to get psychiatric help. As she says, the entire JNU community ganged up against her. Don’t forget that her accusation was backed by solid corroborative evidence; the formal inquiry at JNU had found  Kanhaiya guilty of misbehaving with her and fined him Rs 3000. This happened long before anybody outside JNU knew who Kanhaiya was. At that time, liberals didn’t care. What mattered to them was that they had found an articulate rabble-rousing voice against the Modi government. They had no qualms about making him a big hero. They gushed towards him with tributes. All sense of right and wrong was sacrificed at the altar of their compulsive need to hate Modi. Remember that this is the media environment in which the celebrated left-wing comedians of today grew up. In fact, the whole JNU fracas around Kanhaiya Kumar was sort of a debut for the “cool” young radical leftist on the Indian social media scene. This was just the time that avenues were opening up for social media stars to begin making some real-world money. The leftist comedians we see today latched on to the opportunity. The media said being anti-national was cool. These unimaginative, untalented “performers”, who had to rely on child rape jokes back in the day, decided to board the liberal ship. No wonder that they also imbibed the belief among leftists of the day that it was okay for Kanhaiya to expose himself before a woman and misbehave with her. Kanhaiya has remained a pied piper for anti-national “coolness” to this day. Journalists are still beating a path to his door, hanging on to his every word, worshipping the ground he walks on. Every other day there is an editorial in major newspapers talking about how India needs “youth leaders” like him. And there are multiple reports that he might be contesting the next Lok Sabha election. His uncouth, unbecoming, harassing, menacing ways became a celebrated symbol of “Azaadi”. For the wannabe “woke” comedians, the message was clear. Trampling over women didn’t matter as long as you became a star of cool and hip anti-Modi “dissent.” This is the entitlement mentality behind sending unsolicited d*ck pics and demanding nude pics from women, including minor girls. Case after case tumbled out of budding young liberal stars who were acting as sexual predators. In each case, nothing happened to them. Often times, the publicity even gave a boost to their careers. Of course, the predators noticed. They noticed that being anti-Modi was a magic armour which would excuse all possible crimes. Their friends on the liberal circuit were happy to promote them as well because the ends always justified the means. Make no mistake, there is not one liberal who is actually ashamed today about what was happening on the left wing scene until the moment they all got caught. They are just waiting for people to forget about the matter so that they can return to business as usual.",2018-10-07,"AIB,All India Bakchod,JNU,Kanhaiya Kumar,left liberals,liberal hypocrisy,sexual exploitation,Sexual Harrasment",Remember when Kanhaiya was accused of flashing his d*ck to a woman?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/remember-when-kanhaiya-was-accused-of-flashing-his-dck-to-a-woman/
436,OpIndia Staff,"The Election Commission (EC) on Monday in the Supreme Court accused the Congress party of using forged papers to undermine the integrity of the Commission ahead of elections in five states. The EC alleged  that the Congress is resorting to peddling wrong voter lists that have been rectified by the Election Commission earlier after finding some discrepancies. The ECI said to the court it had rectified the error in the voters’ list in June after Congress had complained about the same and went on to accuse the Congress of using fake lists to discredit the institution. Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Sachin Pilot had filed a petition  in the Supreme Court as they had claimed that there were nearly 60 lakh fake voters in the state. Following this, the apex court had issued a notice to Election Commission to respond to the allegations. Election Commission had denied the allegations and said that these are “misleading and misconceived”. The Election Commission had also said that the Congress party leaders should be punished  for furnishing fabricated voter list. The Commission had asserted that it had always upheld the integrity and purity of the electoral process and was committed to holding “free and fair elections”. The Supreme Court bench comprising of Justice A K Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan was hearing the responses  of the counsel representing the EC. Vikas Singh representing the Election Commission said that “Despite the voter list being corrected, Congress continues to peddle mistakes in earlier lists and attempts to discredit a statutory organisation which has earned an impeccable reputation for conducting free and fair elections”. “This is nothing but using forged documents to scandalise the EC”, said Singh to the court. Kabil Sibal appearing for the Congress demanded an inquiry conducted by the CBI into the duplicate votes and also wanted to fix responsibility on the EC officials who are alleged to be involved in creating Bogus voters’ list. Vikas Singh supported the call for a probe on the charges but also added that there should also be charges against people for false accusations and should be punished if their allegations turn out to be false. “The allegations should be taken to a logical end. Let there be an inquiry. If EC officials are found guilty, let them be punished. But if the petitioners are found to have made wrong charges, they should also be punished”, said Vikas Singh. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the dates for the assembly elections  in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Telangana.

439,OpIndia Staff,"Large-scale violence has erupted at several places in Gujarat following the alleged rape of a 14-month-old girl in the state. According to reports , the girl was raped on September 28 in a village near Himmatnagar town of Sabarkantha district in Gujarat. Residents of the village belong to the Thakor community. Following the incident, one Ravindra Sahu, a labourer from Bihar, was arrested on the same for the rape, according to the police. Sahu works in a local ceramic factory. Following the arrest, attacks on people from Bihar and UP took place  in several places in the state including Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Patan and Ahmedabad districts in the last one week. The attacks were instigated by hate messages against people from UP and Bihar being circulated on social media. After it was known that the rape accused is from Bihar, the Kshatriya Thakor Sena demanded that migrant workers from other states should not be given jobs in Gujarat. A mob of around 200 people, allegedly led by Thakor Sena members, attacked a factory near Vadnagar town of Mehsana district on October 2 and thrashed two employees. Similar violence has happened against people from Bihar and UP in many places in the state, either led by Thakor Sena members or people belonging to Thakor Community. To contain the violence, police has arrested around 170 people so far. Police security is also have been placed outside industrial units where migrants from other states work. According to Gandhinagar Range IG Mahendrasinh Chavda, till Friday evening 23 FIRs have been registered for rioting, damage to public and private property. Nearly 20 State Reserve Police (SRP) companies have been deployed for security in the affected districts. Police said that most people being attacked are factory workers and street vendors. “They are being targeted by design. In industrial areas, the attacks have been reported when factories are about to open or close,” said a senior police officer. Handcarts selling panipuri and other street snacks by non-Gujaratis have been ransacked by attackers in several places. Meanwhile, Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor, who is also president of the Thakor Sena, has claimed that members of his organisation are innocent and has demanded that all cases against them are withdrawn within 72 hours. He says that people from the community and members of Sena may be involved in violence but no instruction was given from Sena for any attack. He says that Sena is only targeting government and private companies for employing people from other states. Alpesh claims that the rule of 80 per cent local employment has not been followed by companies in the state. But, it was Alpesh Thakor who first raised the issue of non-Gujaratis while demanding “justice” for the rape victim.

The last time ABVP had won elections in the University of Hyderabad was way back in 2009-10. According to the reports , the ABVP had fought elections this year with an alliance with the Other Backward Classes Federation (OBCF) and the Sevalal Vidhyarthi Dal (SVD). The contest was a three-cornered fight with the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), the student wing of the Communist Party of India, and United Democratic Alliance were also contesting for the post of office bearers. Aarti Nagpal, a PhD Psychology student won the post of UoH SU president by defeating Erram Naveen Kumar of the SFI by 334 votes. The posts of vice-president, general secretary, joint secretary, cultural secretary and sports secretary were won by Amit Kumar, Dheeraj Sangoji, Praveen Chowhan, Arvind Kartha and Nikhil Raj, respectively, all belonging to the ABVP alliance. The ABVP’s victory is considered to be historic, as the University of Hyderabad is considered to be a left-wing bastion. Students Federation of India (SFI), which is affiliated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), an Ambedkarite students’ group are considered to be very strong in UoH and ABVP snatching victory from them indicates that the rising wave of Right-wing politics in communist-dominated Universities. This victory in Hyderabad University seems to be important for ABVP, as in 2016 the UoH was rocked by protests by the left-wing students over the death of PhD student Rohit Vermula .

442,Raju Das,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi is on a campaign trail in Madhya Pradesh ahead of assembly elections in the state, addressing one rally after another. And in every speech, there is one constant , a promise to set up a mobile phone manufacturing unit the place. This has become so common that people have taken it for granted, and before the start of a speech by Rahul Gandhi, people predict that he will promise a “made in <insert place name>” mobile factory, which eventually comes true. Other than mobile phones, Rahul Gandhi also talks about factories of shoes, clothes etc. Based on such speeches by the Congress president, a website has come up as a platform for various production ideas of Rahul Gandhi, called MIA (made in Amethi ). This website gives details of announcements to be made by their ‘CEO’ Rahul Gandhi about new factories. Today, Rahul Gandhi was campaigning in Jabalpur. And as always, people were eagerly waiting for the announcement of ‘made in Jabalpur’ mobile phones. Even the website was so sure about the announcement they had listed it as their upcoming event. The site had announced that their CEO will launch made in Jabalpur mobile phones on 6 Later in the day, Rahul Gandhi started his speech, and people eagerly tuned into the speech to hear the announcement. But no, something wrong happened, the speech ended, and Rahul Gandhi did not promise the much-awaited mobile phone factory in Jabalpur. This disappointed the entire country, not to speak about people of Jabalpur who were devasted at this ‘betrayal’. What wrong the people of Jabalpur have done to not deserve a phone factory which every other town and city and Madhya Pradesh is getting? Even Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Sigh Chauhan was waiting for the announcement, and he announced his disappointment on Twitter.   Obviously, it was a huge embarrassment for the MIA website, and they were forced to publish an apology on behalf of their CEO. Visitors to the website were greeted with this full-page banner message. This had led to widespread speculation about why Jabalpur is not getting a mobile factory. Did Rahul Gandhi simply forget it? Does he have something against the city? Did someone do a Chatur Ramalingam on him and changed his speech? Was there a glitch in the matrix? Nobody could tell, not even the MIA. Just when the entire nation was about to fall into the darkness of depression, suddenly a huge ray of light flashed before everyone. What was it? Another speech by Rahul Gandhi. People had reacted too early. In the evening, Rahul Gandhi addressed people in Jabalpur during a roadshow, and during that speech he said those golden words. Made in Jabalpur mobile phones.

And do note the massive round of applause he gets when says those three magic words, at around 2:25 minutes in the video. Perhaps Rahul Gandhi’s team record everything and they learnt about the massive disappointment in the country, and decided to make a turnaround. Maybe he decided to prove MP Chief Minister wrong. Or maybe like all good performers, he had kept his best for the last. This is also a matter of speculation now.

446,Sanghamitra,"Rahul Gandhi is a visionary. His visions, future plans and his ideas for India’s youth are so great, the depths of their utility and possibilities are unfathomable for the common minds of petty political critics. Who could have thought about the possibility of linking all the MRI machines  or a machine that converts potato into gold? Even the makers of Westworld on HBO seems to have been inspired by the idea that Rahul Gandhi hinted at because the human-looking robots on the show behaved very much like linked MRIs. JK Rowling would have considered re-naming her debut book  Imagine a world where not only Mrs Obama cooks in Made in Jaunpur patilas  but Queen Elizabeth uses Made in Aligarh locks to safeguard the treasures stolen from India, Vladimir Putin uses Made in Chitrakoot mobiles to sabotage elections in the North Pole and Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to do a Kailash Mansarovar Yatra because all the Chinese youth who got jobs through Indians clicking selfies incessantly, want to vote for Rahul Gandhi. Would not that be a beautiful, beautiful world? Rahul Gandhi does try to let everyone know about his dreams and visions but, as we said, not all of us have the required acumen to understand it. Take for example Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He had mocked the princeling lately saying that while Rahul is making promises of building mobile factories everywhere he visits, his own constituency in Amethi is yet to even make a ‘Patli pin ka charger’ . Chouhan’s comments had started a whole new hashtag on Twitter #MadeInAmethi. However, while most of the country is busy making fun of the Congress prince, a group of kindred spirits have gone ahead and made a website that makes all (well most of) Rahul Gandhi’s visions come true. Yes, we are speaking about www.madeinamethi.com . It is not a mere website but a portal to another world, a pathway where mediocrity ends and Rahul Gandhi style ingenious brilliance begins. The website offers an extensive range of products, from made in Amethi Rafail Jets to Gohler showers and BHEL manufactured Gantail phones. It has Rahul Gandhi listed as its CEO and ‘social worker’ Mia Khalifa as the brand ambassador, who swears that the Mia in her name stands for Made In Amethi. The website also features an exclusive list of products made in Amethi by the exceptional foresight of their CEO. If the sceptic and unappreciative people of India think that that is all the brilliant entrepreneurs working under the brand name have to offer, they could not be more wrong. The website offers a whole lot of products that are not only ingenious but are engineering marvels too. Form a G-phone that charges via an apple, a ‘Vadramobil’ that is literally real-estate in motion to specially designed Pogoplay, the website has the potential to put Jame Bond’s Doctor Q to shame with its innovative ideas. That is not all, the website even has a separate section that announces upcoming products, based on scheduled rallies of Rahul Gandhi, because rallies are where Mr Gandhi ‘invents’ these high-tech products and establishes factories . The website is breaking records in terms of sale and popularity. There is a real-time calculator displayed that claims that so far more than 64,000 people have ordered products from this website. Indians finally seems to be waking up to modern technology and innovations. Earlier there had been a website called www.rahulgandhiachevements.com. Though the new website selling products envisioned by Gandhi seems much more popular among netizens. People on Twitter are discussing a lot about it and the products are selling like hot samosas. While Sanghi, patriarchal and communal politicians of India are busy in mundane things like distributing gas cylinders and health insurances, the website inspired by Rahul Gandhi’s vision and guidance seems to be the only technologically dedicated, innovation-focused and future-ready platform that is aiming to fulfil the long-standing scientific innovation gap in India’s history. If the popularity continues, we will not be surprised when people all over the world will be flocking to Amethi to witness the miracles at work, aliens in faraway planets will be attempting to borrow Mr Gandhi’s ideas and Amethi will leave Detroit, Shanghai, and Stuttgart far behind in being an industrial and technological hub.",2018-10-05,"aloo sona,Amethi,Congress,make in india,MRI,PM Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,Sarcasm,Twitter India","All of Rahul Gandhi’s dreams and promises are coming true, at least on this website",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/all-of-rahul-gandhis-dreams-and-promises-are-coming-true-at-least-on-this-website/

449,Abhishek Banerjee,"Recently, on several platforms, Prime Minister Modi has finally been taking on the Congress over the issue of “phone banking” during the UPA years. Those were the days when the “naamdars” would call up the banks on behalf of big business and get them to hand out lakh crore loans like candy. Keep in mind that most of these happened to be Public Sector Banks, which means that the people of India would be on the hook when these loans went into default. Now, we were already aware of the sinister deals that would be finalized in secret phone calls during the UPA era. Remember the famous tapes involving a lobbyist, a celebrity journalist, a big business house and a Cabinet Ministry that later became the focal point of a now legendary scam? But the true extent of the rot was revealed by PM Modi when he stated that while our banks had collectively lent Rs 34 lakh crore just between 2008 and 2014. This is near twice  the entire amount of Rs 18 lakh crore that the banks had lent in all the years from 1947 to 2008. When the NDA government was sworn into office in May 2014, a full disclosure of the UPA’s loan disaster would have led to unprecedented panic, further sinking the economy. But now the ship has been steadied, with India cementing its position as the fastest growing (major) economy in the world. In 2013, they would speak of India as being a “fragile five” economy. At the end of 2018, the world prepares to welcome India into the top five economies in the world by GDP. The journey of India from “fragile five” to “top five” is nearly complete. The focus of Modi government was therefore to stop the bleeding, to see to it that loan conditions were strictly followed and to bring back whatever could be brought back. When the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill was passed in 2016, it received little fanfare. Quietly, the Modi government had enacted a sweeping reform. And now we have this: And this: So what was the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code? In simple terms, it created a speedy time-bound mechanism where a creditor can appeal if a company is not paying back its loans. Again, the key words here are *speedy* and *time bound*. The exact time limits vary depending on the size of the company, but in most cases, the matter must be resolved within 180 days. If the company refuses to pay up, the owners of the company will lose control, their assets will be seized and sold in order to pay back their loans. In other words, the code puts an end to the days when a big business could take out all the loans it wanted and then turn into a wilful defaulter, bullying its creditors, refusing to pay back the money. They have 180 days to pay or else they will lose their company. And pay they did. To the tune of Rs 1.1 lakh crore. In many instances, the creditors withdraw the case after filing, very often because the company pays  up. Modi’s IBC code is not just a boon for the banks. One must also understand how it helps small businesses. Very often, a big company will owe money not just to banks, but to a number “operational creditors.” Frequently, these are smaller companies like suppliers and contractors etc who cannot keep running their day to day operations without their dues being cleared by big corporations. While these small suppliers and contractors face bullying from big defaulters just as much as banks, the problems of these small businesses are rarely reported in the media. Indeed, this is why the maximum number of cases under this new law has been brought by operational creditors and not banks. Remember that these small businesses are where the real job growth comes from. The easier life is for budding entrepreneurs, the more entrepreneurship we will have. And today’s small businesses might grow tomorrow into big businesses that employ thousands of people. Finally, the IBC code also short-circuits a number of scams that big companies have come up with over the years to beat the system. Let me explain with an example. Suppose that a big company wants to purchase a piece of expensive factory equipment that costs, say Rs 100 crore. Let me show you a simple “scam” by which you can own the Rs 100 crore equipment for just Rs 10 crore. Step 1: Get a “naamdar” to call a big bank and lend you Rs 100 crore to buy the equipment. Step 2: Forget the loan, let it go bad. Step 3: Let the equipment be seized by the banks, who will now try to recover their money by selling it. Step 4: But an expensive piece of factory equipment is not a toy that just anyone would want it. Often, at the auction, there is just *one* bidder, the same company whose equipment was seized. The same company now bids just Rs 10 crore. Step 5: The desperate banks have no option but to sell the seized equipment back to the same company for the rock bottom price of Rs 10 crore. Step 6: Scam complete. The Rs 100 crore loan has disappeared. The company now fully owns the Rs 100 crore equipment by paying just Rs 10 crore. Where did the other 90 crores come from? If the bank was a public sector bank (most common scenario), those 90 crores came from *your* pocket. Outraged? You should be. So, here is what Modi’s IBC Code did  about it. Look what happened here: The wilful defaulters, their parent company and even related persons are barred from buying back the assets at rock bottom prices. Sorry, Essar. This is the story of how the Modi government went out on a limb and took on the most powerful and most entrenched elements in the system to save public money. Our money. A story that is rarely told. In recent weeks, we have seen one naamdar and his numerous minions in the ecosystem making all sorts of allegations against the man who calls himself the “chowkidaar” of India’s money. Perhaps you will now have a better sense of why these nonsensical allegations are being made and who might gain from getting the chowkidaar out of office.

450,OpIndia Staff,"The Mahagathbandhan or the Grand Alliance is beginning to crash even before its actual inception, as the proposed allies seem to be casting aspersions on this idea. According to the reports , this time it is Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav who appears to be unhappy over Congress attitude ahead of the elections. Just a day after Bahujan Samajwadi Party leader Mayawati thrashed Congress Party and rejected any alliance with the grand old party in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday has called the Congress to take the initiative to bring anti-BJP parties on one platform in poll-bound states. Akhilesh Yadav expressing his displeasure  over the delay by the Congress to bring like-minded parties said that the delay in this regard might prompt other parties to declare their candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in both states. He further expressed fear over the delay as it might hamper the so-called ‘Mahagathbandan’. Yadav said, “I am saying even today that the Congress should show its large-heartedness, and it should contest elections by taking along all the political parties who have similar thoughts and ideology”. He further went on to mock Congress saying that the party will be accusing other political parties of colluding with BJP after they decide to contest alone. He was referring to the failure of the Congress to stitch an alliance with BSP, which is now fighting alone in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The cracks in Mahagathbandhan has already appeared, as BSP supremo in a press conference slammed Congress  and called Congress leader Digvijaya Singh as a ‘BJP agent’. She had accused the Congress of playing minority appeasement and also using Dalits but not doing anything substantial for their development. Incidentally, this comes after Akhilesh Yadav had asked for a much larger role  in the alliance and had demanded an all India pact with Congress rather than just a coalition in Uttar Pradesh.

451,Amrita Bhinder,"From proclaiming slain terrorists such as Burhan Wani as freedom fighters, and even issuing postage stamps  in their honour, Pakistan has done a lot to harm India’s peace and unity. It has gone to war on four occasions in its 70-year existence and has continuously indulged in activities both subtle and not so hidden to undermine internal harmony of its easterly neighbour. Amongst its primary areas of interest lies the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and it has successfully managed to create an environment where both the local Kashmiri as well as millions of citizen across other parts of India often question the ‘price’ that is being paid to ‘retain’ the state within the union of India. In what could possibly be the perfect foil to the decades-long psy-op played by Pakistan, the government of India’s decision to hold urban local body and panchayat elections in the state have the potential to change the conscious as well as the subconscious minds of the people of the state and make them play a greater role in their well-being. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that unbeknownst to the average Indian, the nation has been at war with Pakistan ever since it attained freedom from the British. The creation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was to counter the image of the Republic of India where the Constitution held everyone equal. Yet one of the first successful attempts to subvert India was to fabricate an idea that it was a nation where the minorities are not equal participants in nation building, ergo, secondary citizens. Despite the fact that thousands of Muslims who migrated to Pakistan from India were treated as unequals and labelled ‘Mujahirs ’ or in just over two decades of its creation Pakistan unleashed such a reign of terror on its own citizens that lived in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) that the country was split into two in 1971 or members of the Ahmadiyya Community that included the country’s first Nobel Prize laureate, Abdus Salam, were declared Non-Muslim  by the then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1973 and Pakistani Sikhs and Hindus undergoing religious discrimination  ever since one could recall, Pakistan has always succeeded in making the world, and, ironically enough, even Indians themselves, believe that its India and not them where only the majority is making life hell for others. In simpler words, this notion is what constitutes psy-ops and all attempts to further the Pakistani agenda have been at play for decades in India. As a nation, India has traditionally defined war in the conventional sense where battles are centered around the borders. While there has been an effort to change that approach, the biggest step in that direction is about to unfold. In addition to reestablishing democracy at the grassroots level in the state, the upcoming Panchayat elections in Jammu and Kashmir would also see a bevvy of activities that would perhaps for the first time in a long time truly make the regular citizen of the state a stakeholder in their own future. To be held in nine phases between October 8 and December 11, the Urban Local Body and Panchayat elections are the first of their kind in the state since 2005 and 2011 respectively. They would see the direct elections of sarpanches of the Panchayats, which would not only ensure accountability but also enable the locals to directly deal with the issues that trouble them the most. The elections would also see the release of Rs. 4,335 Cr of 14th Finance Commission Central grants  to the duly constituted local bodies, which, otherwise would have continued to remain unused by the people of the state. It’s not just about the funds but the Panchayats, like most other Indian states, would also get the functioning  of the subjects within the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution of India that includes outfits such as the primary health centres, primary schools, Anganwadi Centers et. al. Every panchayat would also have the power to generate their own funds from Building Permission Fee, Taxes on entertainment, advertisement, hoardings, various kinds of businesses & profession etc. that would now come under them. What’s more, the Home Minister Rajnath Singh in a statement issued on 28 September also said that going forward the local representatives would be responsible for the implementation of national schemes and their coffers would be supplemented by the both Central and State Government funds for MGNERGA, PMAY, ICDS, Mid-Day meal etc. Once the locals understand the role they are poised to play in the shaping of their future, the responsibility of maintaining a peaceful environment to let the promise of a glorious tomorrow unfold by ensuring a safe today becomes paramount. Pakistan has been running campaigns to tell Kashmiris that their future is not secure with India and ‘freedom’ is the only way ahead but steps such as the financial powers of a standard Panchayat being increased over ten times from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 1 Lac, Block Councils assured to get two and a half lac rupees instead of twenty-five thousand, and the Chief Executive Councillors also serve as Chairman of all Tourism Development Authorities, it’s not just freedom that is going to come the regular Kashmiri’s ways but the liberty to also chart their own course. With so much at stake, it’s only natural for the Central Government to assure the people of the state of their safety. Reiterating the Modi-government’s commitment to see the tenets of democracy cover the final mile in Jammu and Kashmir, the Home Minister tweeted  that the Centre would deploy sufficient numbers of Central forces to ensure that the elections are held smoothly and the fact that the state would get an unprecedented additional 400 companies  of troops more than puts across the point that how important this exercise is. It’s therefore quite shocking that two of the big local political parties the National Conference (NC) and the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) do not want to participate in this process of giving power to theaamKashmiri. Both parties have opted to boycott the polls  due to the Central Government’s stand on Article 35A, which grants special privileges  to residents of J&K. The subconscious mind absorbs it all and the brain, more often than not, tends to believe certain things because somewhere it has been conditioned so. Up until now, the mentality of the Kashmiri was being targeted to shape a certain reality by Pakistan as a part of its official policy and by the separatists owing to vested interests. Now, as the possibility of the happy reality of the Kashmiri actually shaping their mentality, which has been constantly stopped either by the gun or propaganda, increases those who stand to lose their traditional strong-hold cannot help but expose themselves. People within Jammu & Kashmir, as well as other parts of the country, are beginning to question the powers as they are recognising that facts are extremely stubborn things and no amount of wishful thinking or inclinations can alter reality.

Hours after the honourable Supreme Court of India announced the verdict, Congress central leadership came out in its support stating  that it fully supports SC’s decision but left a fig leaf when it said that Kerala state unit is free to express its opinion based on the “sensitivities” involved.

456,Research Team,"The civil society was known to exert a disproportionate influence on policy-making during the UPA regime. The UPA set up the National Advisory Council (NAC) to advise the then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh and was chaired by Sonia Gandhi for much of the UPA’s tenure. Many believed that the NAC was the unofficial Prime Minister’s Office. In this article, we would investigate the members of the committee who were responsible for drafting one of the most severely contentious laws. The draft of the Communal Violence Bill, officially referred to as the Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill, 2011, would have proved to be one of the most disastrous laws if it were to be enacted. It assumed  that only religious or linguistic minorities and people from the Scheduled Castes and Tribes could be the victims of communal violence conveniently ignoring all ground realities. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had correctly said  then that the bill was anti-majority and presumed that the majority community is always to blame for the communal violence. In 2010, the NAC entrusted the drafting  of the Communal Violence Bill to a 32-member group. Here, we shall look into the background of some of these people who were either part of the Drafting Committee or the 19 member Advisory group. Shabnam Hashmi is one of the founders of the NGO ANHAD whose FCRA registration was cancelled  in 2016 by the NDA government due to “undesirable” activities against the public interest. As per DeshGujarat , ANHAD was majorly a Church funded organization. Ram Puniyani had opposed the hanging of terrorist Afzal Guru. He is associated  with the Center for Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS) and ANHAD. The CSSS is an NGO that receives funds  from abroad, most notably the Heinrich Boll Foundation, a think tank for policy reform that maintains  close ties with the German Green Party (Alliance 90/The Greens). Asghar Ali Engineer, the founder of the CSSS, was also in the advisory group for the drafting of the bill. As per SheThePeople , Usha Ramanathan is a member of Amnesty International’s Advisory Panel on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Gautam Navlakha, the arrested Urban Naxal, and Usha Ramanathan appear to be well acquainted with each other.

Justice S Muralidhar, who was a member of the two-man bench of the Delhi High Court that set aside  the August 28 order of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) granting transit remand of Gautam Navlakha to the Maharashtra Police citing non-compliance of various mandatory legal requirements, is the husband of Usha Ramanathan as per a TOI report . Harsh Mander is the director for the Center for Equity Studies. In his article on the political marginalization of Muslims which was shared by current Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, Mander writes , “Muslims are today’s castaways, political orphans with no home, for virtually every political party. This despite India being home to a tenth of the world’s Muslims, around 180 million people, making it the largest Muslim country after Indonesia and Pakistan. There has never been a harder time to be a Muslim in India, not since the stormy months that followed India’s Partition.” Mander is also a known Ishrat apologist , the female LeT operative who was killed  an encounter along with three others by Crime Branch Officials in Gujarat. As per DeshGujarat , Mander’s NGO has received a significant amount of financial contribution from foreign organizations. Verma is an ex-Vice Chancellor of the Lucknow University. Recently, she was invited to an event of the All India Professionals’ Congress. We have documented her ideology and background in an earlier report . Verma vehemently opposes the celebration of our culture in government institutions, even Saraswati Puja at educational institutes. She has also expressed her reservations with the verdict of the Allahabad High Court which had paved the way for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. She is also believed to have supported the cause of expelled students at Lucknow University who had indulged in vandalism at the campus and attacked teachers.

458,K Bhattacharjee,"The nation is celebrating Gandhi Jayanti today and it is again that time of the year when liberals will lecture Hindutvavadis to take lessons from the life and deeds of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. And yet, there are some ideas and teachings of Gandhi that they conveniently ignore. Here, we shall look at a few quotes by Gandhi that liberals would do well to take lessons from. Gandhi was a staunch proponent of cow protection as is evident from his words. Gandhi gave more importance to cow preservation than the chanting of Mantras and the observation of strict rituals. Indeed, he was of the opinion that Hindus will be judged by their ability to protect cows. According to Gandhi, cow preservation is indeed a sacred duty. Gandhi’s devotion towards cows is in stark contrast with liberals who constantly spread vile propaganda against Gau Rakshaks while giving a free pass to cow smugglers who are known to attack even the Police during their crime spree. Gandhi had a few words to offer to missionaries as well. Given Gandhi’s intense dedication and devotion towards Cows, it is extremely hypocritical of liberals to chastise Hindus on the basis of only one side of the story while they do the most disservice to Gandhi by not adhering to his sermons on cow protection.

459,Aarti,"Dear Rahul Gandhi, You have been in the public life for almost fifteen years now, of which the first decade your party was in power. The ten years of UPA government were clouded with various scams, most of which were responded with radio silence from your end. Since the past four years, you have been in the opposition, where under your leadership, Congress has failed to gain the lost ground in 2014. Despite that, you are still hailed as a hero by your party leaders and your party is pitching you as the prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming 2019 general elections. I have been following your speeches and social media account for the last four years but when I am asked to list your achievements as an opposition leader I struggle to mention even one. Your hugs and winking spree, your inability to stand with the government when it was attacking the enemies, your address to the NRIs in Germany when Kerala was facing worst floods in the history followed by your visit to Kerala when the government had finished most of the restoration work comes to my mind. A part of me wants to take you seriously but when I think of your actions I am unable to do so. There is no consistency in the message that you share as the leader of the opposition and as the President of Congress party, except, perhaps your soft Hindutva stand. During Gujarat election, saw you doing temple run  in Gujarat and you visited Gujarat frequently for campaigning. So much so that your party leader had to come out and ‘clarify’ that not only are you ‘a Hindu, but a janeu dhaari Hindu ‘.  On the same lines, we never saw you visiting or participating in any of the events organized by the Muslim community. Why did you alienate your core vote bank? You recently went to Kailash Mansarovar and soon after your visit posters in MP presenting you as Shiva Bhakt  emerged. I was starting to think that maybe you are genuinely concerned about Hindus but then your party served a shocker. I recently saw Randeep Surjewala saying that if Congress party comes to the power it will give  reservation to the upper caste. Reminded me of the time you had promised  Paditars will get reservations if Congress comes to power in Gujarat. What is worst is none of your party representatives including you ever explain to the public how will your party give reservation to Patidars and upper caste communities. You accuse the BJP of playing communal card and dividing society, while you and your party indulge in the same. You bash Modi in India and on international platforms, I understand your agenda but then I never see you answering how you will change things when you come to power? You have been going on and on that Modi government failed in handling the Doklam crisis . However, when you were questioned how you would have handled it, you said how you were not aware of the details and hence could not answer . What, then, are you basing your allegations that the Modi government failed? Rafale is another thing you have been consistently attacking the BJP government but even there I see no consistency in your attacks. How do you manage to quote different  figures in your speech at different places? Why do you do that? Is it that hard to remember or does the number change and multiply automatically as the election is nearing? If you are so confident on BJP government’s indulging in corruption what is stopping you from filing a case? Let the law take its due course? Why hasn’t congress party been able to go to the court with a proof? All these noise making should result in something, right? You have talked about women empowerment at so many places then why did your own member of social media IT Cell had to struggle to get heard  when she was abused by one of the co-workers? Why did the accuse have ‘full support of the Congress ‘? Why did your IT head, Divya Spandana, indulge in blaming the victim ? And then your juvenile winking spree. From the floor of the parliament , to rally in Rajasthan , it is just bizarre to see someone who aspires to be the prime minister of world’s largest democracy indulge in such kiddish acts. It makes one feel that you are not serious about the issues you are talking about. And that ‘many facets of Rahul Gandhi ‘ stunt your IT cell did in an attempt to make you appear cool, makes one wonder if you think running a country is like participating in a comedy show! You are getting good traction on social media and I must applaud your social media team but there too your party goofs up  way too often. National Herald, your mouthpiece accepted that Bofors was a scam . A self-goal indeed. I wish you start taking yourself seriously and stop with the theatrics if you wish to be taken seriously as a worthy opposition. Because as of now the only thing that I can see is your and your party’s desperation to come to the power and that alone doesn’t suffice for an educated, thinking voter to vote for you.",2018-10-03,"2019 general elections,Congress,divya spandana,Narendra Modi,Open Letter,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,sexual exploitation,Temples,UPA,Women Empowerment","Rahul Gandhi, try not to turn yourself into a joke if you want others to take you seriously",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/rahul-gandhi-try-not-to-turn-yourself-into-a-joke-if-you-want-others-to-take-you-seriously/

The blast  took place yesterday just outside of a multi-storied building where the Chairperson of the North Dumdum municipality, Panchu Roy has an office. As per reports, Panchu Roy who considers himself to be the intended target of the bomb hinted at a political motive behind the blast and claimed that these political forces were plotting to kill him and his TMC worker. As per initial investigation , ammonium nitrate was used in carrying out the blast. According to reports, the blast was of such intensity that even the windows of the opposite building were shattered and it put a dent on a nearby shutter door of a shop. Barrackpore Police Commissioner Rajesh Kumar Singh who had earlier gone on records calling  it a high-intensity explosion, later contradicted his own statement by calling the blast a low-intensity one.

461,Research Team,"The All India Professionals’ Congress has invited Professor Roop Rekha Verma, ex-Vice Chancellor of Lucknow University, a social worker and an activist, at one of its events on the topic of ‘Protecting the secular fabric of the nation’. The event was confirmed on its Facebook page. Considering the myriad controversies social activists have been involved in recent times, we looked into the background of Professor Verma to learn her opinions and gain some knowledge about her ideological positions. Professor Verma is strictly against the building of a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. She has, in the past, expressed reservations  about the Allahabad High Court verdict which divided the disputed land between Ram Lalla represented by Hindu Sabha, Nirmohi Akhara and the Sunni Waqf Board in equal proportions. The 75-year-old is very sympathetic to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. “There is no sea change that you see on the ground,” she said  in January 2017 while speaking about the SP government in Uttar Pradesh, “but this Government has managed to generate the confidence that something is being done for women.” According to one account, Verma along with a few others supported  Arvind Kejriwal in 2014 against ‘communal fascist’ Narendra Modi in Varanasi. In 2014, Verma was one of the intellectuals who branded Narendra Modi a threat to secular democracy. The statement by ’eminent people’ read , “Never before in post-independence India has political forces, which are a front for an organisation committed to creating a Hindu Rashtra, made as strong a bid for power as in the coming elections. These forces are led by a person who presided over a pogrom against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 and has never expressed any contrition over his role in that ghastly incident. And they enjoy the backing of the most powerful corporate houses in the country. The prospect of this alliance of corporate capital and communal forces coming to power constitutes a palpable threat to the future of our secular democracy.” The former Vice-Chancellor of Lucknow University is vehemently against Hindu rituals being performed in educational institutions. She told  HuffingtonPost, “The new VC (of Lucknow University) has this idea of beginning a session with Saraswati puja. I had opposed this saying a university is a secular place, students of all religion come here. So anything that is a ritual belonging to just one religion should not be performed here.” She is also against Hinduism in any government setting. “The tourism department’s hotels all have a Ganesh at the entry. If it was just for beauty, I would have understood. But no, there’s a puja done every day. There’s nothing associated with other religions present in these buildings I have noticed,” she added. She perceives the celebration of India’s cultural heritage as ‘saffronization’. Professor Verma is believed  to have been involved in an incident of vandalism at Lucknow University. In early July, a group of expelled students owing allegiance to the Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha had indulged in vandalism and attacked teachers leaving numerous people injured. As per Lucknow SSP, Verma was supporting the cause of the expelled students. The activist is one of the ‘prominent Indians’ who are seeking to interfere  with the NRC process. She was one of the academics and activists who filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking intervention in the ongoing NRC update in Assam. The group requested the Court that a direction is issued to recheck the documents of all those whose name hadn’t featured in the final draft. The professor was also part of a tribunal organized  by Act for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) and Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) that came to the conclusion that minorities were being victimized by the Police on the charge of being involved in terrorist activities in the country. It appears that the tribunal reached its conclusions after hearing only one side of the story, that of the alleged victims and their relatives. It is pertinent to mention that ANHAD’s FCRA registration was cancelled  by the NDA government in 2016. And we have well documented the activities of HRLN, which is an FCRA NGO as well, in our series on Civil Society. Professor Verma was one of the signatories to a letter that demanded the repeal of AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir. A certain portion of the letter appeared to blame the Indian government for Burhan Wani becoming a terrorist. It reads , “Available accounts of Burhan Wani’s life in militancy indicate that he was as a 16-year old, embittered and radicalised during the 2010 turmoil by the casual humiliations heaped on ordinary Kashmiris by the mass deployments of security personnel. He witnessed repeated violent incursions into his home and the harassment of near relations in what is called “crackdowns”, in terminology that has entered the youth argot of the valley. The death of his brother in a police encounter, when he had nothing to do with the militancy, is believed to have further hardened his resolve. Burhan Wani’s life story should be a cautionary warning that the heavy-handed, militaristic Indian approach to Kashmir, has only led to a quarter century of siege and growing alienation.” It certainly appears that parallel to the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is seeking an alliance with ‘civil society’ to defeat Prime Minister Modi in 2019. The supposed understanding between the Congress and Civil Society here also exposes the farcical nature of Rahul Gandhi’s sudden towards Hinduism. Here, we have a woman who is against the worship of Goddess Saraswati in educational institutions and disagrees with the verdict of the Allahabad High Court in favour of Ram Mandir. That the Congress party has no compunction in inviting her to address a discussion on protecting secularism is quite revealing.",2018-10-03,"activists,AFSPA,Akhilesh Yadav,Arvind Kejriwal,Lucknow,Narendra Modi,NGOs,rahul gandhi,samajwadi party,Uttar Pradesh",Here is who Congress invited to talk about ‘protecting the secular fabric of our nation’,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/here-is-who-congress-invited-to-talk-about-protecting-the-secular-fabric-of-our-nation/

Ironically, as one Twitter user pointed out, there were no women on the stage which talked about problems faced  by women. When the allegations against Khan surfaced, Congress had decided to carry out a probe and even a committee was set up for the investigation. The alleged incident took place when Khan was in Bengaluru ahead of Karnataka elections.

Lambasting at the Chief Minister for playing the ‘majority appeasement card’, the clerics have come out in the open and asked Mamata Banerjee that if the state has enough funds for sponsoring Durga Puja then why not for Imams in the state. The chairman of The All Bengal Minority Youth Federation ( Mamata Banerjee who for all this while has been known to play the minority appeasement card in Bengal is now facing threats from the State’s minority itself, who have come out in full strength to protest against the State Government, blaming them to play the caste-based politics. Earlier too, in 2016 Mamata had faced  similar threats when over 10000 Muslim clerics had taken on the city roads raising similar demands. Last few attempts of Mamata’s political gimmicks, however, have seemed to be backfiring on her. Stuck between this political disorientation, last year almost during the same time of the year, people had called out at the West Bengal Chief Minister, accusing her of minority appeasement over her decision  to fix Durga idol immersion time which coincided with the Taazia procession during Muharram. Following the announcement, a PIL  was filed in the Calcutta High Court which claimed that the announcement had hurt the religious sentiments of the majority community, following which the Calcutta High Court had pulled  up Mamata Banerjee led West Bengal government over their decision.

465,Raju,"According to reports , Priyanka Gandhi’s house in Shimla is finally nearing completion and the Vadra family will have ‘griha pravesh’ during Diwali. Under construction since 2008, this house has faced many controversies and several redesigns. Let’s revisit some of the controversies surrounding the house: The Vadras had purchased  a plot of 3 and a half bigha of agricultural land in Charabra hills, 13 km uphill from Shimla. Located at the height of 8,000 feet, the plot was purchased for around Rs 47 lakh from US-based Satish Kumar Sood and Satinder Sood in 2007. The then Himachal Pradesh government had relaxed norms under Sec 118 of Land Reforms and Tenancy Act because under land laws of the states only permanent residents can buy land in the state. Others who want to buy land have to obtain relaxation under the said law. The plot is just 500 meters away from The Retreat, the summer resort of the president of India. Due to this proximity, clearance from President’s secretariat had to be obtained for the house. The construction of the house began in 2008, after demolishing the existing two-storey cottage as Priyanka wanted the house to have look and feel of the surroundings. In 2010, most of the partially constructed house was pulled down, as construction quality was poor and Priyanka was not happy with the house. Construction was restarted with a new architect and a new design. In 2011 and 2013, two additional adjacent plots from different owners were purchased , for approach road to the house and to accommodate the new design. One Devinder Jit, who owns a huge plot of land next to Priyanka Vadra’s property, wanted to build a hotel on his land. But the government rejected his application citing proximity to high-security Retreat. Even High Court also had rejected his appeal in this matter. In 2014, RTI activist Dev Ashish Bhattacharya filed an application  under RTI seeking information regarding the house. The application was rejected by Deputy Commissioner’s office, stating that such information can’t be revealed due to security reasons as Priyanka is an SPG protectee. Bhattacharya approached State Information Commission, and in June 2014 the commission had directed the state government to provide the information sought within 10 days. Following the order of the Information Commission, Priyanka Vadra had filed a writ petition at the Himachal Pradesh High Court challenging the order, and High Court had stayed the order to reveal information against the RTI application. In April 2016 the High Court issued a notice to Priyanka Vadra in the case. Bhattacharya is alleging several irregularities in approving the purchase of land and seeking file notings, copies of the sale deeds, relaxations being given, the land status of Priyanka as on date. The irregularities being alleged are: In June 2016, BJP MLA from Himachal Pradesh Suresh Bharadwaj raised an objection  to the house, saying that it is a “high-security zone” and such activities are not allowed in such a zone. He said that the house is close proximity to Presidential Retreat and Kalyani helipad, and people in the area have been refused such permission in the past. VVIPs like Prime Minister also stay at the Retreat during their visits and the helipad is exclusively by the Air Force for such VVIP movements, therefore the permission granted for the house should be withdrawn, the MLA had demanded.",2018-10-03,"Congress,Congress corruption,Himachal Pradesh,House,Priyanka Gandhi,rahul gandhi,Robert Vadra,sonia gandhi",Here are some facts about Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra’s controversial new home in Shimla,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/here-are-some-facts-about-priyanka-gandhi-and-robert-vadras-controversial-new-home-in-shimla/

468,Ron Grosset,"I read with interest Vice President Venkaiah Naidu’s remarks addressing the fourth convocation of the National Institute of Technology Goa reported by Press Trust of India on September 29, 2018. Some sections of the media had quoted Naidu as saying “English is an illness left behind by the British” during a Hindi Day event held in New Delhi early this month. “Somewhere I was speaking about protecting and encouraging the mother tongue and some section of the media wrote that I said English is (an) illness, I did not say English is (an) illness. English is not (an) illness, but English mind is (an) illness which we have inherited from the Britishers,” he said. “Britishers have left but they have created an inferiority complex. They have given the thought that Britishers are great, foreigners are great and we are nothing. We must come out of this mentality. We must feel proud of our heritage, our past and our great leaders of this country,” the Vice President added. Naidu recalled that India never attacked any country, but it was “ruined” by invaders. “They (invaders) ruled us, they ruined us. Not only they ruined us economically, but they ruined us mentally also. Some of the people are suffering from that disease,” he said. The Vice President insisted that Indians must get back to their roots. In my opinion, as a ‘Britisher’, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu is absolutely right. There’s nothing I can do, as a British citizen about the colonial mindset to which Naidu refers, however, he says “Don’t forget culture. Don’t forget Indian philosophy.” And I couldn’t agree more. Just look at the struggle we ‘Britishers’ have had to protect our own culture and language. In Scotland – our Parliament is supporting initiatives to preserve Gaelic and Scots languages. The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 was passed as a first step to secure the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland with equal respect to the English language and to create a sustainable future for Gaelic in Scotland, against a background of declining numbers of those speaking Gaelic fluently. The Scottish Government’s Gaelic Language Plan came into operation in June 2010. Scottish dialects are known collectively as the Scots language – ‘Doric’, ‘Lallans’ and ‘Scotch’ or by more local names across various dialect regions of Scotland. Various organisations promote the use of Scots in formal, informal and everyday use. In Wales – there is real passion about the Welsh language which continues to thrive with nearly 20% of the population speaking Welsh. Various parliamentary acts (1993, 1998 and 2011) provide that English and Welsh’s languages have equal importance. ‘Cymraeg 2050’ a strategy announced by the Welsh Government in 2017, aims to increase the numbers speaking Welsh to 1 million by 2050. In Ireland – there are long-standing initiatives to preserve and promote the Irish language. Údarás na Gaeltachta is the authority responsible to ensure that Irish remains the main communal language of the Gaeltacht (an Irish-language word for any primarily Irish-speaking region) and is passed on to future generations. Vast sums are being spent to protect and preserve our culture. Naidu said “We have beautiful languages. We should always respect them. Try to converse within the family, society in the mother tongue.” That’s exactly what we ‘Britishers’ are trying to do in our homeland. The example given by Naidu – “Let us give up the colonial minds. I have done some small-small changes in the Rajya Sabha. When any minister wanted to lay the paper on the table they used to say ‘I beg to table’. I said begging whom? I said we should say ‘I submit a paper or lay on the table’. ”Naidu is right – but this particular example simply demonstrates the use of archaic English in India, perpetuated by schools and authorities simply reprinting archaic English texts. I remember talking to students in Mumbai, not so very long ago, and asking why certain phrases were still in common use. The answer? They all had been brought up on Wren & Martin’s book – High School English Grammar and Composition or collectively, a series of English grammar textbooks written jointly by P. C. Wren and H. Martin. These were written primarily for the children of British officers residing in India, and were widely adopted by Indian and Pakistani schools in the post-colonial era. The books were published in 1935, with a discussion on composition added later. The content in the books is largely based on The Manual of English Grammar and Composition by J. C. Nesfield. Published by the ‘Britisher’ Macmillan in 1908. The Vice President said there is nothing wrong in learning English or any other foreign language. “You can learn as many languages as you want. You can learn Portuguese, Chinese, Russian, there is nothing wrong. We should discuss and debate in our mother tongue.” The key, however, for Vice President Venkaiah Naidu is to accept that English has official or special status in more than 75 countries with a total population of over 2 billion. By most common estimates, around 750 million people speak English as a foreign language. There are 6,000 languages in the world today, and half of the world’s population speaks only 10 of them. English is the single most dominant of these 10. The British Council has gathered many of the statistics relating to English: English is the main language of books, newspapers, airports and air-traffic control, international business and academic conferences, science, technology, diplomacy, sport, international competitions, pop music and advertising. Over two-thirds of the world’s scientists read in English. Three-quarters of the world’s mail is written in English. Eighty per cent of the world’s electronically stored information is in English. Of the estimated 200 million users of the Internet, some thirty-six per cent communicate in English. English is used as the lingua franca between nations where English is not the primary language. In a globalised world, the number of English learners around the world is only expected to grow further. 25% of the world’s population speak English to some level of competence; demand from 75% of the world’s population is increasing. The ‘Britishers’ have not left. The British Council continues to do extraordinary work in India and offers a range of projects in arts, education, English language and society to audiences with Indian partners in cities all over India. The educational publishing market in India is still dominated by British brands. Thankfully, Indian publishers are challenging the market in India with excellent English language material. If India can simply accept that English is important, and ‘get over’ the ‘Britisher’ attitude and embrace modern English – even American English, then the contribution that Indian people can make to the world on a truly global scale is absolutely unlimited – but not at the expense of India’s languages. Naidu is right “We have beautiful languages. We should always respect them. Try to converse within the family and society in your mother tongue.” I write this article from Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. We are book publishers, of many years standing, with alliances, friendships and associations with India going back for more than 30 years. From a British perspective, although I am Scottish, we are currently struggling, as a still United Kingdom, with the issues surrounding Brexit. I, like the majority of Scots, am a ‘remainer’, but what we all must share and care about, and take pride in, is our culture and heritage.

As per reports, the ‘activities’ of these three workers at Bamrauli airport on 28th September made their ‘Shiv Bhakt ‘ party president Rahul Gandhi ‘uncomfortable’. According to a report  in Jagran.com, 3 Congress leaders, namely Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Mukund Tiwari, Youth Congress Pradesh secretary Haseeb Ahmed and former general secretary of youth congress Jitendra Tiwari. The report states that when Rahul Gandhi landed in Bamrauli airport in Uttar Pradesh after his Chitrakoot address on 28 September, these three leaders shouted slogans like ‘Shiv Bhakt Rahul Gandhi Zindabad’, ‘Har Har Mahadev’ and reportedly gifted  a picture of Lord Shiva to him. Rahul Gandhi reportedly found these slogans unnecessary and uncomfortable. On top of that, former MLA Anugrah Narayan Singh, who was supposed to bring food for Rahul Gandhi was reportedly stuck in a traffic jam and thus Rahul had to go back hungry. Anil Dwivedi, a district president in Congress party has informed that the three persons had ignored ‘party discipline’ and Rahul Gandhi’s security while chanting the slogans and hence they have been expelled. However, Haseeb Ahmad, one of the expelled leaders, has reportedly stated the media that similar slogans were raised in Amethi too after Rahul Gandhi returned from Kailash Mansarovar yatra. He has also reportedly questioned Rahul Gandhi’s sincerity because there is nothing wrong in chanting Har Har Mahadev. Haseeb Ahmed has earlier been in news for depicting Rahul Gandhi as Shri Krishna  protecting Renuka Chowdhury’s honour and BJP leaders including the Prime Minister as Kauravas as a recreation of the famous episode from the Mahabharata when the Kauravas attempted to disrobe Draupadi. Earlier Haseeb had got creative with their posters and shown his support for Congress president’s sister, Priyanka Gandhi, since ‘mother is ill and brother is overworked’. The BJP, however, has lashed out at Congress and Rahul Gandhi stating that the entire projection of Rahul Gandhi being a Shiv Bhakt was a total farce. Sudhanshu Trivedi, the BJP spokesperson, has stated  that Rahul Gandhi has shown his true colours from Mansarovar to Prayag Raj and he is not a Shiv Bhakt but rather a ‘Bagoola Bhakt’ (fake devotee, referring to the Panchatantra tale of a heron that fakes religious devotion to find easy prey). It is notable here that since Gujrat elections, Rahul Gandhi and Congress have been trying very hard to play the ‘soft Hindutva’ card. Rahul was seen temple hopping  during the Gujarat and Karnataka elections . He had also claimed to have gone on a religious pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar. Congress party workers and leaders have made several attempts to portray  him as a Shiv Bhakt, Ram Bhakt, and even an Avatar of Shiva.",2018-10-01,"2019 elections,allahabad,Congress,Karnataka election,Lord Shiva,madhya pradesh assembly elections,Priyanka Gandhi,rahul gandhi,raj babbar,Renuka Choudhary,Soft Hindutva,Somnath temple,Uttar Pradesh","Shiv Bhakt Rahul expels partymen for chanting Har Har Mahadev, BJP lashes out",https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/shiv-bhakt-rahul-expels-partymen-for-chanting-har-har-mahadev-bjp-lashes-out/

474,K Bhattacharjee,"The surname Gandhi has been an integral feature of Indian politics ever since a certain Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi entered the movement for an independent India. Soon enough, he was honoured with the title of ‘Mahatma’ and his birthday on the 2nd of October is one of the three national holidays of India. Considering Gandhi’s stature in Indian politics, it was only to be expected that Indians politicians would try and latch on to him for their own electoral prospects. And it is for certain that the Gandhi dynasty that has flourished in India for decades has as much in common with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi as the Congress party in the current year has with the Congress party of yore. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has transformed M.K.Gandhi into a political tool to beat the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) with. They themselves care very little about the principles that Gandhi envisioned and worked towards in his life. Gandhi’s dedication towards cow protection is well documented and well known. And yet, during the 1966 anti-cow slaughter agitation, the police fires upon the protesters and murdered quite a few of them, all under the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s watch. More recently, Youth Congress leaders in Kerala butchered  a cow mercilessly in broad daylight in Kerala’s Kannur and cooked it and served it. And if those leaders are to be believed, they did so with the approval  of the state president of Youth Congress itself. In another instance, a Muslim cleric in Karnataka boasted  that cows will be slaughtered in the state during Bakr-Eid in the presence of a Congress minister who did not raise any objection despite the fact that there’s a ban on cow slaughter in the state. Of course, after public sentiment was outraged following the Congress party’s irreverence towards cows, the party now promises  Gaushalas in Madhya Pradesh ahead of Assembly Elections in the state. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has turned Gandhi’s principles into a cheap political gimmick. The greatest legacy of M.K. Gandhi is his commitment to non-violence even when it was horribly misguided. One could argue that his opinions were misguided and possibly even deluded, however, his firm commitment towards the principles of non-violence is very difficult to refute. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, on the other hand, is completely detached from Gandhi’s nonviolence. They thrive on pitting one community against another, one caste against the other, fomenting trouble where there’s none and would stop at nothing to retain their grip on power. The Congress party has no compunction in supporting divisive figures like Jignesh Mevani who was caught on camera instigating people  before violence erupted at Bhima Koregaon. And who could ever forget the Sikh genocide committed by the Congress party in 1984? M.K. Gandhi worked significantly towards the upliftment of the lower castes. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, on the other hand, has exploited fault lines within Hindu society and kept them divided so that they could rule over them. They have substituted development of the lower castes with sowing resentment between different castes. Their senior leader, Mani Shankar Aiyer, uses casteist slurs  against Prime Minister Modi who himself belongs to the OBC category with very little consequence. In his heart, M.K. Gandhi was a devout Hindu. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, on the other hand, has done everything possible and more to undermine Hinduism. They have denied  the existence of Shri Rama in the Court and their senior leader, Kapil Sibal, struggled hard to delay  the resolution of the Ayodhya dispute. Congress President Rahul Gandhi reportedly  told the US Ambassador that Hindu extremists were a greater threat to India than the Lashkar-e-Taiba. The Congress’ extensive efforts to establish the myth of saffron terror is quite well known. And if certain media reports  are to be believed, Pakistani suspects were let off the hook without proper investigation during the same time it was busy furthering the narrative of Hindu terror. And of course, there was the Communal Violence bill which sought to mandate  that only minorities could claim to be victims of communal violence. The Congress party has transformed M.K. Gandhi into a political stick to beat the opposition with. They themselves care very little about the deeds of Gandhi and the ideas he fought for. It is indeed extremely banal that the Congress party would glorify him without caring to actually work towards any of the ideas he actually envisioned. The Congress party has long since abandoned his principles and his ideas, the only thing they have in common with him currently is the surname.",2018-10-02,"communal violence bill,Congress,cow slaughter,Gau Rakshak,jignesh mevani,Mahatma Gandhi,mani shankar aiyar,Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,saffron terror,sonia gandhi,Youth Congress",The Congress party has betrayed every principle that Mahatma Gandhi stood for,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/the-congress-party-has-betrayed-every-principle-that-mahatma-gandhi-stood-for/

As Vivek refused to stop his car, Prashant shot a bullet at him which hit him on his chin after piercing through the windshield of the SUV. Vivek was taken to Lohia hospital where he succumbed to his injury while the doctor was tending to him.

Meanwhile, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had met with the deceased’s wife on Monday, 1st October, following which she had expressed her faith in the government. Kalpana Tiwari told  news agency ANI, ” He heard what I had to say & assured help.

477,shwetashalini,"Sister Christine referring to Swami Vivekananda once said: “Our love for India came to birth, I think when we first heard him say the word, “India” in that marvellous voice of his. It seems incredible that so much could have been put into one small word of five letters. There was love, passion, pride, longing, adoration, tragedy, chivalry, Heimweh, and again love. Whole volumes could not have produced such a feeling in others. It had the magic power of creating love in those who heard it.” Scores of thinkers right from ancient times have tried to figure out this wonder named India. This civilization had an enchanting effect on the world and being the oldest civilization continues to enchant people, pique curiosity and exert its influence upon this world in ways unknown. Right from the poses of Yoga to the deep diversity in each region of this nation, this nation continues to make people right from social scientists to civilizational experts flounder in their assessment. So what is this nation we call Bharat or India? What is Bhartiyata then? Media had raised a storm after the recent statement of Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat Ji referring to Bhartiyata somehow making it seem that RSS had a change of stance. Needless to say, the people making this hue and cry never understood Bharat nor RSS because RSS has just reinforced its Nationalist Stand of Bharatiyata. The cultural inclusiveness of Bharat is a fact which RSS and all Nationalist organizations always knew to be true. When Sister Nivedita exhorted the nationalist youth, who had gravitated towards Vivekananda’s message, to internalise and work for “jana-desh-dharma” she was uttering a sutra of national service inspired by an intrinsic identification with the spirit of Bharatiyata. In fact, the Jana Sangha Founder Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya always used the phrase “Bhartiyata” which makes the current uproar seem needless. So how do we understand this seemingly elusive concept called Bharatiyata? Rabindranath Tagore put it succinctly when he suggested reading the works of Swami Vivekananda to know about India, as he felt, in Vivekananda “there is everything positive and nothing negative.” In Bharatiyata every Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jew and Parsi is Bhartiya first and Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jew or Parsi second. He may practice difference philosophies, worship Gods with different names but accepts all religion as True and leading to the One Supreme Goal. That is the essence of the Bharatiyata which all Nationalist Organizations including the BJP believe in. The Slogan “India First” is a by-product of this deep-rooted ideology. Bhartiyata is the essence of Bharat on which there is no argument or debate across party lines. The other aspect now comes around namely Hindutva which is again a confusion of an ignorant mind. Hindutva is and never was distinct from aforementioned Bhartiyata and the seemingly religious connotations attached with it. Hindutva simply the essence of Hindu Dharma is what Indianness or Bhartiyata is all about. The ignorant leftist minds do understand the deeper meaning of the word “Dharma” being righteousness just like all Indians understand it. Of the four ashrams in Hinduism, only the Vanaprasthashram stage is when Dharma is referred to as religion while Karma and Artha take preponderance in Brahmacharya and Grihastashram. However, for some political expediencies in today’s India, some political parties overlook all this because for them Ignorance is bliss. The Sarsanghchalak statement on Bhartiyata needs to be seen in this context. As far as crediting the Congress is concerned, PM Narendra Modi himself from the ramparts of Red Fort had expressed his admiration and gratitude towards all Prime Ministers including that of Congress for their contribution to the Nation. There has been no doubt ever about the important Congress role in the Independence of the nation whether it be tallest leaders like Subhash Chandra Bose or Sardar Patel. Many of our iconic freedom fighters have undoubtedly been Congressmen. Having said this, no first family of Indian National Congress (INC) can go around claiming accolades for the INC of Pre-independence India is definitely not the Congress of today. It would be a grave sin to even compare today’s Congress party with that of the past with its internal democracy where even the Mahatma can be challenged by Subhash Chandra Bose. Today it is merely a family fiefdom existing well past its go-by date destined to languish unless the democratic spirit in it is revived. The Congress leaders in 2019 have to make that bitter decision on whether to opt for a family run party headed by a clueless leader or a party for every Bharatiya. Another important question which the debate on Bharatiyata brings up is on “Secularism”. The lexicon supposed to be a positive word has gained the dubious reputation of being the most misused word in India. Bharatiyata with its rich syncretic tradition of assimilating a vast repository of scriptures, philosophies and thoughts is the only land which believes in multiple ways to the same divine and hence truly secular. No other culture can lay claim to such a non-violent and inclusive philosophy much tainted in large part due to invasions across the centuries. It continues to exist despite these many challenges and continues to believe in Sarve Bhavantu Sukhina (May all be happy) & Vasudaiva Kutumbakam (The whole world as a family). The leftist continues to remain purposely unaware of the age-old Indian philosophy and continue to harp on supposed “Secularism”. No coincidence that the same man George Holyoake who coined the word Secularism also coined the term “Jingoism” The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is committed to bringing out the best of Bharat and make it the Vishwaguru again. Restoring this great motherland to its past splendor is easier said than done. India under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi ji is taking giant leaps on this front and marching ahead towards prosperity. Bhartiyata is the only secularism that is. It is the only philosophy which encapsulates and assimilates all thoughts, ideas into one and only this philosophy can make the world rid of extremism & internal conflicts. India will lead the world in this philosophy as it has always done and ensure a strong, powerful united nation. It will be Bhartiyata i.e “India First” which will be an example of nationhood for other countries to emulate. All this of course does not mean that BJP or RSS endorses the return to a Congress version of secularism which appeases rather than empowers minorities. We believe in empowering each Bharatiya so that Bharatiyata in them blooms like the lotus of BJP.

478,Nirwa Mehta,"Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal today took to Twitter to express ‘condolences’ on the death of Lucknow resident Vivek Tiwari, who was allegedly killed  by a bullet injury, fired by Uttar Pradesh Police on the intervening night of 28th and 29th September. In the first tweet tweeted at 6:40 am, almost 24 hours after the incident took place, Kejriwal said, “Vivek Tiwari was a Hindu, then why kill him? BJP leaders are freely raping girls across the country? Open your eyes, BJP is not a wellwisher of the Hindus. To get to power, they will not think twice before murdering all Hindus.” Kejriwal’s tweet came almost 24 hours after the UP Police had filed a case of murder (under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) against the two policemen who shot Vivek Tiwari, who later succumbed to injuries. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) had also been formed under the SP Crime of UP Police for a magisterial inquiry into the incident. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also condemned the incident and said that if needed, a CBI probe will be ordered into it. Tiwari’s death was condemned by authorities and action had been initiated against the policemen involved within hours of the incident, but Arvind Kejriwal chose to ignore all this to give it a ‘religious’ twist and take a dig at Yogi government. He then went further with the allegations and quoted Rohini Singh  who is associated with The Wire , and said that the BJP does not ‘protect the interest of the Hindus’. Rohini had tweeted at 12:45 am on 30th September, questioning whether there will be a proper investigation in the Vivek Tiwari murder, hours after the case against the two policemen who had shot at Tiwari was registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police and action has been initiated against them. Even when Singh was questioning the Uttar Pradesh Police, Kejriwal took this opportune moment to again bring a religious twist to it. Kejriwal, however, got called out by Twitter users who pointed out his insensitivity and an attempt to communalise a crime. AAP rebel leader Kapil Mishra asked Kejriwal to get himself checked by a doctor since he seems to have gone mad in attempt to be anti-Modi and anti-BJP. He was also reminded how many Hindus (since Kejriwal was quick to point out Tiwari’s death), are also killed in West Bengal, where Mamata Banerjee is the chief minister, whom Kejriwal refers to as ‘didi’ (elder sister). Saner voices came together to call out Kejriwal on this. Some even questioned whether he meant that killing of Muslims was okay? That he threw in rape casually in a tweet to communalise and politicise a murder was also got called out. An Aam Aadmi Party volunteer, Soni who had committed suicide in 2016, was reportedly adviced by Arvind Kejriwal to ‘compromise ‘ when she complained to him about an AAP worker of sexually abusing her. Kejriwal then tweeted how he had ‘spoken to his wife on phone’ just now. Tiwari’s wife, however, was upset at Kejriwal’s attempt to link religion to her husband’s death. Kalpana Tiwari, Vivek’s wife, even in time of grief could see Kejriwal’s attempt to communalise her husband’s death, but some media outlets couldn’t. India Today published a story titled ‘Murder of #VivekTiwari: Arvind Kejriwal hits out at Yogi Government’, giving a free pass to Kejriwal to spread religious divide.  After being called out on social media, India Today quietly changed the headline and edited the article. Other media houses, too, instead of calling out Kejriwal’s dirty, divisive politics, chose to highlight Kejriwal’s communal tweet. It is unfortunate that the political discourse in India has come down to such a level that chief minister of a state, an elected public representative, who is an IIT alumnus and also served as a bureaucrat, has stooped to such a low level that he has chosen to communalise a murder and instead of questioning the police administration, is discussing the religion of the deceased.",2018-09-30,"Aam Aadmi Party,Arvind Kejriwal,BJP,Divisive politics,hindu,Religion,Sectarian politics,Twitter,Uttar Pradesh,uttar pradesh police,Yogi Adityanath",Arvind Kejriwal shouldn’t link everything with religion: Vivek Tiwari’s wife on Kejriwal’s ‘communal twist’ to Lucknow murder,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/arvind-kejriwal-shouldnt-link-everything-with-religion-vivek-tiwaris-wife-on-kejriwals-communal-twist-to-lucknow-murder/
479,Nirwa Mehta,"In a shocking display of insensitivity, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tried to give a religious twist  while politicising the death of Vivek Tiwari by claiming that the BJP does not protect the ‘interests of Hindus’. He then later had a telephonic conversation with the widow of Vivek Tiwari. Kalpana Tiwari, while addressing media lashed out on Kejriwal for trying to bring in caste and religious angle in the unfortunate death of her husband by the hands of UP policemen. While interacting with media, Kalpana Tiwari was asked what did Kejriwal talk to her about. She said Kejriwal extended support to her. When she was questioned about Kejriwal’s communal tweets, she expressed her disbelief and said how can someone who is as sincere as Kejriwal bring a casteism angle in this. She added that right now she needs comfort and support and the killing of her husband has no caste angle to it. “You shouldn’t add caste angle to everything. Because Modi government has never encouraged casteism and people from every community are extended help and support,” she added. However, despite being called out by Vivek Tiwari’s widow, Arvind Kejriwal brazened it out on Twitter and tweeted again at 12:09 pm that “an innocent Hindu was killed in broad daylight.” He added that the killers then held a press conference in the police, while your minister calls him a criminal. But when we ask for justice, we are accused of having a lowly thought? Vivek Tiwari was killed on the intervening night of 28th and 29th September by a bullet injury, fired by Uttar Pradesh policemen, following which a case of murder (under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) was filed against the two policemen. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) had also been formed under the SP Crime of UP Police for a magisterial inquiry into the incident. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also condemned the incident and said that if needed, a CBI probe will be ordered into it. Despite that, Arvind Kejriwal chose to focus on the religion of Tiwari instead of the fact that this is a law and order issue which needs to be tackled. Kejriwal entered politics on the plank of non-corruption and hopes of being a politician who would be different from the existing ones. He had promised a clean government, devoid of politics based on divisive politics based on caste and religions. However, Kejriwal has, over the time, set lower bars of politics in India. So much that he makes the existing lot of politicians, many of whom have criminal cases behind them, appear saner. Kalpana Tiwari has just lost her husband. Even before she could come to terms of losing a loved one, Arvind Kejriwal has descended upon the death of her husband to gain a political mileage by mudslinging the BJP ruled government in the state. That her husband died of bullet injury fired upon by UP cops, who were perhaps not aware of his religion, caste or even name, is shoved aside as Kejriwal insists that Hindus are not safe because BJP government killed a ‘Hindu’. No, an innocent man died, leaving behind a grieving wife and a family which will take years, if not months, to come to terms with his untimely demise. Please do not tarnish it and use a death of an innocent to further your politics. But Kejriwal’s tweet shouldn’t really come as a surprise to us. He got away scot-free when an AAP volunteer, Soni, committed suicide after she claimed that when she was sexually assaulted by a fellow AAP worker, but when she complained to Kejriwal, he asked her to ‘compromise ‘. At a time when the nation was still coming to terms with the heinous Kathua rape case, Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders including Alka Lamba had spread the fake news about the rape  of a girl in Surat claiming involvement of BJP/ABVP leader in the crime. When dozens of girls were rescued from the house of horrors in the shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, Kejriwal was caught smiling and making merry  and sharing a joke with Shehla Rashid. Unfortunately, it is not just Kejriwal who has displayed lack of sensitivity. Following the arrest of Kejriwal’s nephew Vinay Bansal in connection with the PWD scam, the AAP chief’s wife Sunita Kejriwal  took to Twitter to put out a veiled threat to Delhi LG Anil Baijal to ‘stop harassing’ her widow sister and the AAP government. She had told Baijal to be careful since he would know what happened to former LG Najeeb Jung, who is now ‘suffering from severe illness’ and he ‘regrets what he did with AAP government,’ insinuating that Jung was suffering from ‘severe illness’ as a ‘karma’ of what he ‘did with AAP’ and hence, to save himself from such ‘karma’ Baijal should not ‘harass AAP government and her widowed sister’. The crass language used by his wife was even worse than Kejriwal who usually does not leave any stone unturned to lower the bar of decency. I am shocked and ashamed at the brazenness displayed by the chief minister of a state. As a responsible voter of India, I am disgusted and ashamed to have Arvind Kejriwal represent me.",2018-09-30,"Aam Aadmi Party,Arvind Kejriwal,Casteism,Communal Politics,Sexual Assault,sunita kejriwal,Uttar Pradesh,uttar pradesh police,Yogi Adityanath","Kalpana Tiwari, on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal, we are sorry",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/kalpana-tiwari-on-behalf-of-arvind-kejriwal-we-are-sorry/
480,OpIndia Staff,"The Rahul Gandhi led Congress party has gone hammer and tongs against the Modi government alleging a scam  in the Rafale deal. While several experts from all quarters have explained why there is no scam in the inter-governmental deal between India and France, the allegations don’t seem to stop . Rahul had even claimed that he had a one to one conversation with French President Macron and in the conversation, he was informed that India is free to divulge information regarding the price of the jets. The French government had immediately issued a clarification  saying that no such meeting between Rahul Gandhi and Macron had taken place at all. Recently, Former French President’s Hollande’s statement that the Indian government had suggested the name of Anil Ambani’s Reliance as one of the offset partners had struck a massive row. However, soon, news surfaced that Hollande had partially made contradictory statements  saying that he was aware of no pressure to choose Reliance. Rahul Gandhi had immediately lashed out and called the Prime Minister a thief alleging quid-pro-quo. In the meantime, links between Sanjay Bhandari , a close friend of Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law, Robert Vadra had also emerged in the Rafale deal. It was revealed that from 2012 to 2015, Sanjay Bhandari was lobbying to become the offset partner in the Rafale deal and Dassault had refused to indulge him. After these links emerged, speculations gripped the nation. Many wondered whether Rahul Gandhi and the Congress were trying to sabotage the Rafale deal because Sanjay Bhandari did not the offset deal. Amidst such speculations, another theory was floated on social networking website, Twitter. Vikas Bhaduria, a journalist with ABP News alleged that recently, Sales Director of a big company of fighter aircraft’s met five senior leaders of two different parties to raise the Rafale issue as a scam so that both the company/weapons dealer and political party benefits. He then said that the first meeting took place in Germany in the last week of August this year. Veteran journalist Kanchan Gupta also weighed in on the theory. He said that the buzz indicates that the meeting was set up by some steel tycoon between representatives of the European defence MNC and Indian politicians. On 1st September 2018, MyNation had also reported  that top Congress leaders had met US arms company before the Rafale storm arrived. Interestingly, Rahul Gandhi himself was in Germany towards the end of August 2018. Rahul had tweeted about his Germany trip on 23rd August 2018. The theory, though unconfirmed also gathers steam because when the bids were accepted by the Indian government, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Rafale by Dassault were the only two contenders that met the specific requirements. While the Indian government decided to go with Rafale, it is reported that Eurofighter also lobbied rather aggressively to get selected. The Eurofighter Typhoon was designed originally as an air superiority fighter and is manufactured by a consortium  of Airbus , BAE Systems  and Leonardo  that conducts the majority of the project through a joint holding company , Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH  formed in 1986. Interestingly, Sanjay Bhandari who is reported to be a close associate of Robert Vadra and had lobbied to become the offset partner of Dassault from 2012 to 2015 was reportedly an agent for Airbus. After a whistleblower had alleged graft in chopper deal and leak of sensitive documents in 2012, India’s relationship with Airbus had hit rocky waters. It was reported that Airbus Group has informed the Defence Ministry of an internal investigation into the allegations of the whistleblower over the tender for 14 twin-engine EC725 helicopters for the Indian Coast Guard. The deal was estimated to be worth over Rs. 2,000 crores. To quote from a 2012 report  (emphasis ours): Sanjay Bhandari is a notorious arms dealer who is allegedly connected to Robert Vadra. The second man mentioned in the 2012 report, Deepak Talwar was also a notorious lobbyist. In 2017, reportedly,  Income Tax Department chargesheet against Talwar, a self-proclaimed corporate consultant (a fancy name for a lobbyist), accusing him of receiving massive kickbacks worth Rs. 1000 crore between 2008 and 2011 for influencing aviation policies of the UPA government to favour his ‘clients’. During the investigation, Praful Patel and Digvijay Singh’s names had also emerged  in connection with Deepak Talwar. In 2018, Deepak Talwar was also booked  by CBI along with Tony Fernandes of Air Asia for alleged violation of norms in obtaining international flying licenses. Though these speculations are only in the realm of possibility and no proof of these speculations have yet surfaced, some facts do warrant a further probe.",2018-09-30,"Airbus,Congress lies,Dassault,Dassault Aviation,Deepak Talwar,Germany,rafale deal,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Robert Vadra,Sanjay Bhandari",Questions about what Rahul Gandhi was doing in Germany and if it was related to Rafale gathers steam,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/questions-about-what-rahul-gandhi-was-doing-in-germany-and-if-it-was-related-to-rafale-gathers-steam/
481,Research Team,"On Friday, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted that he addressed the National University of Advanced Legal Studies in Kochi on “Dissent and Democracy”. Considering the topic Tharoor spoke on, we were curious to know more about the event and what he said. Therefore, we visited the Facebook page of the institution for a video  of his speech after finding no such luck with YouTube. However, as Tharoor says in his speech, he could not stay for the entire duration of the event due to other commitments. With permission from other panellists, he said that he would leave after delivering his address and taking a couple of questions. Scrolling through the page further, we saw a post  about the entire event. The description states that Shashi Tharoor delivered a special address while Advocate P.A. Pouran, Advocate Mathews J. Nedumpara and Dr Athira IPS were part of a panel discussion. The event was further confirmed by a The New Indian Express report . The Express report states that the event was organized by the Centre for Human Rights and the NSS of NUALS and was attended by Advocates P.A. Pouran and Mathews J. Nedumpara. Advocate P.A. Pouran is mentioned as leading People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), one of the organizations linked to the CDRO through its fraternal organization People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR), has intricate links to Maoists. PUCL’s website  lists Adv. Pouran as one of the office bearers of the organization for the state of Kerala. We have reported extensively  on the intricate links between the CDRO and the Maoists. It is pertinent to mention that the arrested activist Sudha Bharadwaj is associated  to the PUCL as well and Gautam Navlakha, another among those arrested who had links  with a notorious ISI funded Kashmiri separatist, is associated with PUDR, fraternal organization of PUCL. Shoma Sen, one of the ‘activists’ arrested  in June in connection with the violence at Bhima Koregaon is a member of the Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights (CPDR), another fraternal organization of PUCL. In November 2016, Pouran had called the killing of two Maoists in an encounter in Nilambur village, Kerala as ‘stage-managed murder’ and called it a cold-blooded murder by the Police. He went ahead and called the Maoists ‘patriots’.  OpIndia.com had also conducted an exclusive interview with surrendered Naxal Pahad Singh who had slammed “jobless intellectuals”  who fan the Maoists. He had asserted that this “fight” is not for Adivasi rights but for the genocide of Adivasis. He had named one of the arrested ‘activists’ Arun Ferreira  and asserted that he was a member of the Rajya committee of CPI (Maoists). Given the circumstances and the crackdown on ‘Urban Naxals’ by the government and considering the fact that Advocate P.A. Pouran has called Maoists ‘patriots’ in the past, it is disconcerting that a senior leader of the Congress party was part of an event that included him. Even though he was not present for the entire duration, it does not bode well for the country if a senior leader of the main opposition party is associated with an event that included a person who believes Maoists are patriots. It should also be noted that Pouran is an office-bearer of an organization that is associated with the CDRO which allegedly has intricate links to Maoists.",2018-09-29,"CDRO,Congress,Kerala,Maoists,naxals,rahul gandhi,Shashi Tharoor,The Naxal Network,UPA,urban maoists,urban naxals",Congress leader Shashi Tharoor participated in event along with a man who called Maoists ‘patriots’,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/congress-leader-shashi-tharoor-participated-in-event-along-with-a-man-who-called-maoists-patriots/
482,OpIndia Staff,"The idea of the Grand Alliance seems to be glooming gradually as the Samajwadi Party (SP) has now come up with a new set of conditions to Congress in order to be a part of alliance ahead of 2019 general elections, reported  Hindustan Times. According to HT, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has plans of spreading its wings across three to four states and has put new conditions on the Congress Party. The senior SP leaders have sought to expand the party in the poll-bound states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh as the upcoming elections could provide them with an opening for the upcoming general elections. Reportedly, SP is pushing Congress for this pact ahead of state elections in exchange for a pact in UP, where it has already tie-up with Mayawati’s BSP. “After fighting against each other in these states, an alliance only for UP would look absurd,” said SP general secretary Kiranmay Nanda. According to Samajwadi party leaders, their party has a strong foothold in some areas of the poll-bound states and the party should contest along with Congress. “If you (Congress) want unity, it has to be other states too where we want to have a share in the alliance. Unity can’t be a one-way traffic that will happen on in UP at the convenience of the Congress,” said Nanda. The opposition parties are facing extreme pressure from the BJP and some parties like SP and BSP are fighting  for the survival ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. The SP-BSP has already formed a tactical alliance and has also demanded Congress for a pan-India pact rather than just in Uttar Pradesh. Both SP and BSP are indeed looking for a fair share of seats in Uttar Pradesh and intend that Congress should play a supporting role, as it is not a serious player in Uttar Pradesh. Recently, senior leaders from both the parties had met to discuss the modalities of the alliance but reportedly, the talks have not yielded any results, as Samajwadi Party seems to “wary about the caste equations and distribution of seats”. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had put the onus of the formation of a coalition on the Congress and had said that it was the responsibility of the Congress to bring people of similar ideology together. The idea of the Grand Alliance is unstable, as recently BSP supremo Mayawati had joined hands  with Ajit Jogi’s Janata Congress Chhattisgarh over the Congress in Chhattisgarh, and had also announced candidates for 22 seats in Madhya Pradesh. As prospects for BSP and SP looks bleak in the upcoming General elections, both the parties are trying out new strategies and seem to be moving away from Congress. The BJP is playing a waiting game, as there are too many contradictions  in the upcoming Grand Alliance. The Congress is being rejected by many regional parties and also being pushed to play a role of a junior party to strong regional parties. The parties like NCP, Trinamool Congress, BJD, DMK, SP, BSP are yet to accept  Congress and Rahul Gandhi as the leader of the Opposition parties.

484,OpIndia Staff,"Trouble seems to be mounting for the Congress party ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections, as their veteran leader and Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Vice-President Mani Shankar Pandey, who has been closely associated with the party for over 45 years, has resigned  from the party. The veteran attributed  the party’s desperation to regain power, and stated that the party has now been rendered direction-less and deviating frequently from its principles. While sending his resignation letter to the Congress president, Rahul Gandhi, Manishankar said that the attitude of the Congress leadership had forced him to break his ties with the party. He further stated in his letter that the coalition-politics (Mahagatbandhan) which the party is resorting to in its desperation to attain power is against the party ideologies. The veteran leader while reconciling his resignation said that he is deeply saddened as today’s Congress is not the Congress which once followed the ideologies laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Slamming the Congress for appointing actor turned politician, Raj Babbar as a state president, Manishankar lambasted saying that there is no room left for experienced, dedicated and old members of the party since the most important offices have been acquired by the non-Congressmen. Recently, in a similar setback, senior Congress leader and 4 times Meghalaya CM DD Lapang  had resigned from the party after citing frustrations due to faulty party policies. Lapang had stated in his letter that Congress is now sidelining senior leaders and phasing them out.

485,OpIndia Staff,"Rajiv Dhawan, counsel for a petitioner in the Ayodhya dispute has expressed his dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court’s latest verdict on the matter. As we have reported earlier, in a majority judgment, the Supreme Court refused to refer the Ram Janambhoomi case to a larger constitution bench. According to Dhawan, the majority judgment will please the majority. Ashok Swain, who is a professor in Sweden, went so far as to assert that the Supreme Court was now divided along religious lies. His remark perhaps stems from the fact that both the judges who endorsed the majority judgment were Hindus and the only judge who dissented is presumably a Muslim. Like Dhawan, liberals appear mighty displeased with the verdict which is expected to hasten the resolution of the dispute. Journalist Rajdeep Sardesai speculates that the verdict on the Ram Janambhoomi case would be reached before the 2019 General Elections, thus benefiting the BJP electorally. Shahid Siddiqui took an issue with bhakts of Shri Rama celebrating the Court’s verdict. He declared that Ram Janambhoomi is ‘Masjid land’. Journalist Seemi Pasha asserted that the BJP had argued that Mosques are not essential to Islam before the Supreme Court while Haryana CM Khattar issued orders that namaz should be offered only at mosques. She says the BJP should make up its mind. However, one fails to see the connection between the two and she comes off as more confused than anything else. Another journalist wondered why Mosques are not required for prayers. Perhaps, she isn’t aware that the Ismail Faruqui judgment is concerned with the acquisition of religious places by the state and observed that offering namaz at a mosque wasn’t integral to Islam as long as the Masjid did not hold any special significance in Islam. Editor of the pro-AAP mouthpiece, Janta Ka Reporter, Rifat Jawaid is particularly displeased with the judgment.

486,Research Team,"We have reported  earlier on the links between shady arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari and brother-in-law of Rahul Gandhi, Robert Vadra. We had mentioned that Dassault had refused to partner with Bhandari’s Offset India Solutions (OIS) due to his proximity to Robert Vadra and that classified documents were found in his possession and was charged under the Official Secrets Act. As per reports, Bhandari was often sighted  with Vadra at arms expos in Dubai and elsewhere. They were often seen together at a luxury hotel in Delhi as well. We may never know the extent to which his proximity to the Congress party helped shape his fortune but there is a certain other political party, that definitely had a profound impact on Bhandari’s fate. For a long time, Bhandari was not under the radar of Indian authorities. But his luck ran out when Deepak Agarwal, a hawala operator, was being scrutinized  in an entirely separate case involving funding to the Aam Aadmi Party. It was discovered that Rs. 69 crore to seven of Bhandari’s companies came from the same hawala operator. It was only then that his phones were tapped and the raids conducted. The raids, as people are well aware, opened the pandora’s box. The hawala connection runs much deeper. Republic TV had reported  in June 2017 that Deepak Agarwal was working very closely with another hawala operator, Mukesh Kumar, to provide accommodation entries to numerous entities, including the Congress party and the AAP. It is reported that Delhi Chief Minister had even tweeted about receiving Rs. 2 crores from Mukesh Kumar. Mentioned in the same report, a notice was sent by the I-T Department to the Congress on May 24, 2017, regarding the dubious transactions. Kapil Mishra, the rebel AAP leader, levelled serious allegations against Kejriwal and his party. “A man who cannot repay a loan contributed Rs 2 crore to the AAP. Mukesh was compelled to talk in favour of the AAP, otherwise his firm would have been shut down by the government, which had issued him a notice in 2013 for non-payment of value-added tax,” Mishra had said  after Mukesh Kumar reportedly told NDTV that he had made a contribution of Rs. 2 crores to the party. Coming back to Bhandari, the source of funds for a plush property in London which was bought  in 2009 is currently under investigation. It was allegedly bought by Vadra and it was Bhandari who funded it. Bhandari was also red flagged by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and a probe was initiated against him by the CBI for allegedly being the kingpin of a scandal where he was importing cars by avoiding customs duty. It is also interesting to note that he had set up the OIS with a paid-up capital of just Rs. 1 lakh. Investigators are believed to be perplexed at how brazenly Bhandari received the documents from the defence ministry. An MHA report states , “According to another input, one Nafe Singh levelled serious allegations against S. Bhandari, in which he blamed Sanjay for stealing the file in respect of the purchase of 126 fighter planes and the file went missing from the ministry and was later recovered on the road. S. Bhandari had been blamed to have his links with F-16 and F-18 contenders and was made responsible for the leak of photocopies of the file to the above mentioned American contenders.” In another shocker, OIS is reported to have received payments of 2,50,000 Swiss francs and 7,50,000 Swiss francs from Pilatus Flugzeugwerke AG merely two years before the IAF bought 75 Pilatus basic trainer aircraft from the Swiss. The Pilatus deal is itself mired in controversy. The Finance Wing of the Ministry of Defense said  in 2015 that the costs of certain components were not calculated before declaring Pilatus the lowest bidder. It was an issue that was raised by the Koreans who had emerged as the closest competitor to Pilatus. The Defense Minister of South Korea personally contacted A.K. Antony, his Indian counterpart in 2011 asserting that Pilatus had submitted an incomplete bid and therefore must be rejected. Bhandari himself is under investigation for alleged malpractices in the selection of the Swiss aircraft. It appears bewildering now but Bhandari may never have faced the heat and his links with Vadra may never have turned into a political slugfest if Deepak Agarwal wasn’t investigated by Indian authorities in a case related to the Aam Aadmi Party. Luck often runs out at the most unexpected of times.",2018-09-28,"A k Anthony,Aam Aadmi Party,AAP,Arvind Kejriwal,Congress,defence deals,Hawala,Kapil Mishra,ministry of defence,Pilatus,Rafale,rahul gandhi,Robert Vadra,sonia gandhi",Sanjay Bhandari’s shady history and his connections to Robert Vadra and Aam Aadmi Party,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/sanjay-bhandaris-shady-history-and-his-connections-to-robert-vadra-and-aam-aadmi-party/

According to reports, Pehlu Khan’s sons and witnesses and lawyer were on their way to a court in Behror to depose in the lynching case when a black SUV without number plates had allegedly stopped them and opened fire at them when they refused to stop. However, the police investigating the case have found no evidence in the claims. As reported by Patrika , the police examined the place at which the lawyer and witnesses claim the firing took place and obtained CCTV footage from a nearby hotel. At 9:04 am, the car in which witnesses were going can be seen passing by but half an hour before and after that no black SUV can be seen in the video. Further, the FSL report states that the place at which they claim their car pressed the brakes, no evidence of braking the car could be found there. Moreover, the driver of the car, Pehlu Khan’s sons, the driver and the witness were independently questioned and their statements video-recorded and all versions reportedly differ. Over and above, no one else could independently corroborate that the firing took place.

488,Sanghamitra,"India’s national entertainer Rahul Gandhi seems to be running out of jokes. Wherever he goes, he has been repeating the same claim of establishing a Mobile factory that would export phones to China and will force the Chinese to use the phones ‘made in’ that town of India. In the last 15 days itself, Rahul Gandhi has promised Made in Bhopal phones , Made in Dungarpur phones and most recently, Made in Chitrakoot  phones. As the Madhya Pradesh elections draw close, the Congress president is touring more and more cities, and as predicted, promising mobile factories everywhere he goes. Like the adorable pug that used to follow previous Vodafone customers before the Zoozoos took over, non-stop laughter follows Rahul Gandhi’s claims be it in public or on social media. Rahul’s Mobile factory obsession created many a memes and jokes on social media. But Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan proved that when it comes to puncturing claims and pouring cold water over sweet, dreamy promises, he is the king of all. Noticing the hypothetical mobile factories threatening to mushroom all over his state, Shivraj Singh Chouhan wondered what has Amethi, where Rahul Gandhi has been an MP for decades now, produced in all these years. For those unfamiliar with the term, Patli pin ka charger means this : Rahul Gandhi has a fertile imagination. He sees what others do not and he is certainly oblivious to things that are plainly visible to everyone . His obsession with mobile phones is turning so strong that after BHEL , he wants HAL  (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) to start making mobile phones too, it seems if the princeling had his way, he will engage the garment merchants of Surat, software engineers of Bengaluru, sweet makers of Mathura and leather industry workers of Kanpur and just about everyone leave their vocation and start making mobile phones.

489,OpIndia Staff,"Recently, Lucknow resident Vivek Tiwari was killed  by a bullet injury, fired by Uttar Pradesh Police on the intervening night of 28th and 29th September. The rightful outrage flooded social media with people demanding justice of Vivek and the wife he left behind. UP Police filed a case of murder (under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) against the two policemen who shot Vivek Tiwari, who later succumbed to injuries. However, there was no dearth of people playing vulture politics of the unfortunate death of Vivek Tiwari. Arvind Kejriwal, supposedly giving condolence said , “UP Police had filed a case of murder (under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) against the two policemen who shot Vivek Tiwari, who later succumbed to injuries”. Vivek Tiwari’s grieving wife took strong exception to Kejriwal viewing this from a religion based prism and said he shouldn’t link everything to with religion. A similar amount of hate was displayed by one Facebook user called Danish Khan. Khan took to Facebook to assert that Vivek Tiwari’s wife deserved her husband being murdered because she had voted for Yogi Adityanath. When one looks at Danish Khan’s profile, one realises that he has worked for several media organisations and is currently working with Arnab Goswami led Republic TV. Danish’s profile says that he was a former graphic designer at Network 18, a former senior assistant producer at TimesNow and is currently working as a senior producer at Republic TV. OpIndia.com reached out to Republic and were told that Danish Khan was pulled up for his comment and given a stern warning against posting such content. Following this, Khan deleted his Facebook post. Republic TV also said that over 70% is non-editorial, just like Danish Khan and it is impossible to be held responsible for all their views. But we are told that the channel has taken this up strictly and asked the employee to refrain from posting hateful content. This is not the first time that posts celebrating the death of people who voted for the BJP have surfaced. A Facebook user named Deepak Sankaranarayanan was slapped with a non-bailable case  by the Kerala police, for a post where he called for the murder of all Indians who voted for the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Deepak who was believed to be an employee of HP based in Bengaluru wrote a Facebook post in Malayalam with reference to the Kathua rape case. In the post, he wrote  that “Justice should prevail, even if it involves shooting to death that 31 per cent, which is seven times the casualty of World War II, that objects to justice.” It is intriguing that while Facebook’s strict community standards deemed necessary to remove a simple post that said “Har Har Mahadev” because “it didn’t follow community standards” doesn’t take action against accounts who post such bigoted and hateful tweets celebrating the murder of a man, simply because they don’t agree with him politically.",2018-10-01,"BJP,Facebook,Media,media bias,Republic TV,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath",Media professional says Vivek Tiwari’s wife deserved her husband murdered because she voted for Yogi,https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/media-professional-says-vivek-tiwaris-wife-deserved-her-husband-murdered-because-she-voted-for-yogi/
490,Raju Das,"As we have already observed , Rahul Gandhi is obsessed with mobile phones. Not a single rally goes where he does not talk about phones. In every rally, he says that at present mobiles phones we buy India are made in China and hence he dreams of seeing mobile phones made in the place where he is speaking. Perhaps he is laying the groundwork  so he can later claim credit for increased manufacturing of cell phones if he comes to power. After all, the Prince will have to say something to substantiate his ‘achievements’. While it has become a source of great amusement on social media, actually there is nothing wrong with promising a mobile phone making factory, or any factory, in an area. That’s the kind of promises politicians make before elections. But there is a big problem with the assumption that Rahul Gandhi makes while talking about mobile phones. He assumes that currently no phones are made in India and all phones come from China only. Which is absolutely not true. Although China remains the global manufacturing hub of mobile phones, India has started to catch up in this sector. Giving a fillip to the Indian government’s Make in India initiative, several phone manufacturers have either set up their own manufacturing plants or have entered into pacts with other companies to manufacture their phones in India. Let us have a look at some of them. This iconic phone that kickstarted that smartphone category is now manufactured, or rather assembled, in India. Apple has entered into an agreement with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron to make the phone, and the production  has already begun. Wistron has set up a plant in Bengaluru where they started by assembling the iPhone SE and later started making the 6s model also. The plant is being scaled up to manufacture more models of the phone. In July this year, Korean giant and global leader in mobile phone sales Samsung opened  the world’s largest mobile phone factory, in Noida, UP. Samsung was already making phones in India, and after an investment of around ₹5,000 crore, they expanded the plant to double the capacity. Now the company will be making 120 million phones per year in India, up from 68 million earlier. Samsung is not just assembling parts imported from other countries, they are in fact populating the Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) for the phones in India itself. Samsung makes all models under the smartphone portfolio of the company, including the flagship Galaxy S9, S9+ and Galaxy Note8, in its Indian plant. Xiaomi, considered the Apple of China, has not one, not two, but as many as six plants  to meet the growing demand for their phones. All the smartphone plants of the company have been set up in partnership with Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturing giant. The company had built its first plant in 2015 in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, while its second plant came up in the same location in 2017. The company opened its third plant in Noida in 2017 in partnership with Hipad Technology. Initially set up for manufacturing power banks only, later this plant started making smartphones also. In April this year, the company started three more phone manufacturing factories, located in Sri City in Andhra Pradesh and Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu. Along with these, the company also has set up  an SMT (Surface Mount Technology) plant for making PCBs in Sriperumbudur. According to the company, they now make two phones per second in its six phone plants. These plants along with Foxconn now employ more than 10,000 people, more than 95 per cent being females. More than 90 per cent of Xiaomi phones sold in India is made in India. Almost all companies that sell mobile phones India have set up manufacturing bases in the country. Vivo has its plant in Greater Noida, while Oppo has set up two plants in Noida. Huawei has set up a plant at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu in collaboration with global electronic manufacturer Flex Ltd. All Indian phone makers like Micromax, Karbonn, Lava, Intex, iBall etc have set up manufacturing units in the country. Premium phone maker OnePlus gets their phones assembled by Oppo in India. These are just a few examples of phone manufacturing plants in India. In the year 2014, there were just two mobile phone manufacturing units in India, by the year 2017, India has become  home to 123 factories making mobile phones. As per a report  by the Indian Cellular Association (ICA), India is now the second largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world. According to data provided by ICA, 11 million units of phones were made in India in the year 2017. India is also the world’s second-largest smartphone market, which no phone maker can ignore. As India is an extremely price conscious market, companies are preferring to make their phones for the Indian market in India only, as they can save on import duty and international shipping costs, which help in keeping prices low. Although so many phones are made in India now, most of them are actually assembled here using parts imported from abroad. But that would change, as India establishes itself as a major manufacturing hub for phones, companies will also start moving component making to India. In fact, that process has already started, Samsung and Xiaomi have around 60 per cent share in the smartphone market, and both companies have started PCB manufacturing in the country. And while India manufactures lots of mobile phones now, contrary to what Rahul Gandhi believes, we still can’t answer some of his other questions about phones. Like, why the Indian government does not buy  mobile phones from Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), or when Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will start making  phones. Unfortunately for Rahul Gandhi, phones manufactured in various Indian places don’t carry the tag like ‘Made in Noida’ or ‘Made in Sri City’ etc, they all say and will say ‘Made in India’.",2018-09-28,"Android,BHEL,HAL,hindustan aeronautics ltd,India,iPhone,make in india,manufacturing,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Samsung","Rahul Gandhi keeps talking about making mobile phones in India, Modi government is already walking the talk",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/rahul-gandhi-keeps-talking-about-making-mobile-phones-in-india-modi-government-is-already-walking-the-talk/

Rahul Gandhi, at his absolute best, has yet again become successful in giving his opponents the chance to question his absurd rationality and intelligence, as he now wants to buy mobiles, shirts and shoes from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Rahul Gandhi, who wanted Government of India to buy Mobile Phones from BHEL  earlier has now come up with another bizarre idea. Rahul Gandhi while speaking at a ‘Sankalp Yatra’ in Madhya Pradesh seems to have struck with another brain fade and ended up saying that he wants mobiles, shirts and shoes to be made in Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). According to the reports , Congress President Rahul Gandhi was speaking at a rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh was found repeatedly talking about his intent to manufacture mobile phones  in Madhya Pradesh. While speaking at a gathering, he said, “We want that on the back of your cell phones, on the back of your shirts, under your shoes, ‘Made in Madhya Pradesh’ is written. We want ‘Made in India’ to be written. We want ‘Made by HAL’ to be written”. Rahul Gandhi, who is at Madhya Pradesh to take part in ‘Sankalp Yatra’  has been travelling throughout the state and making controversial statements. Recently, while speaking at Satna, Rahul Gandhi had repeated the same lie  about the statue of Sardar Patel being ‘Made in China’. The BJP President Amit Shah had slammed Rahul Gandhi  for insulting Sardar Patel and accused Gandhis of trying to erase the legacy of Sardar Patel. This is not the first time Rahul Gandhi has made such statements which ended up puzzling people. Once while speaking at an event in Singapore, he had come up with an idea of connecting  all MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines or scanners. In another incident, 47 years old ‘youth icon’ Rahul Gandhi had said that the founder/owner of Coca-Cola brand was a Shikanj i vendor in America. The wisdom of Rahul Gandhi seems to be a big mystery for both Congress and the BJP. It is not surprising today as whenever Rahul Gandhi makes any public appearance, BJP seems to claim a small pie of victory. It would seem like the BJP has finally found another star campaigner in Rahul Gandhi after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party president Amit Shah.",2018-09-28,"Congress,Congress ecosystem,HAL,Madhya Pradesh,madhya pradesh assembly elections,make in india,PM Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,rahul gandhi defence league,Rahul Gandhi lies,sonia gandhi","After connecting all MRIs, Rahul Gandhi now wants to buy shoes, mobiles and shirts from HAL",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/after-connecting-all-mris-rahul-gandhi-now-wants-to-buy-shoes-mobiles-and-shirts-from-hal/

Continuing his campaign for upcoming assembly election in Madhya Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi addressed a rally in Rewa today, where he repeated the same lies that he is been saying for last several weeks. Rahul Gandhi said that during the UPA regime, the government had done a deal to buy Rafale jets at the price of ₹536 crore per plane, and NDA government is buying the same fighter for ₹1600 crore. He also says that had HAL got the contract to build the planes, youths in India would have got jobs. Now we want to ask, where are those Rafale jets that UPA government bought at an excellent price of ₹536 crore? During the term of 10 years of the Congress-led government, how many fighter jets were bought? Why the fleet of Indian Air Force is reduced to just 32 squadrons when the requirement is of 42 squadrons? If UPA government had finalised the deal with Dassault, why the deal was not completed? After selection of Dassault as the winner of the tender, why the process did not proceed further? Dassault refused  to take responsibility for jets made by HAL, what does Rahul Gandhi has to say about that? Dassault had formed a joint venture with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance and not Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence. Why Rahul Gandhi is ignoring that? Dassault had won the bid for the MMRCA contract in January 2012 itself, what happened in two years after that before the 2014 elections? Rahul Gandhi says had HAL got the contract, youths would have got jobs. Now several companies, both public sector and private sector, including HAL, BEL, DRDO etc, have got offset contracts for the Rafale deal. These private and public companies do not employ people? Only HAL provides employment opportunity to youths? Does Rahul Gandhi want to say that Anil Ambani is going to build the jets himself and Dassault-Reliance JV will not employ any worker? What is this obsession with HAL, a company that is struggling to make the LCA for 30 years, that Rahul Gandhi wants that the company should get every contract in India, should make everything, shoes, shirts and mobile phones included? DRDO has got one-third of the offset business in the Rafale deal, including vital technology transfer. Is DRDO not a public sector unit? Does DRDO not employ people? Why is DRDO bad and HAL good?

495,K Bhattacharjee,"In a critical judgment, the Supreme Court has lifted the ban  on the entry of women of a certain age group into Sabarimala Temple in Kerala. Even after a spirited defence of Hindu traditions by lawyers like Sai Deepak, the Court reached the conclusion that the ban should be lifted. The judgment, however, has exposed the illiberal tendencies of self-proclaimed progressives. The progressives are hailing the encroachment of the Judiciary on the domains of the legislative. Barkha Dutt, for instance, hailed the fact that we are living in a ‘judicial democracy’. One would expect liberals to be concerned about the fact that an unelected wing of the state is encroaching upon the domain of elected representatives. However, they appear to be celebrating as the decisions are going in their favour. They should be cautious that decisions will not always favour them and they might come to regret the fact that they were cheering when unelected branches of the state were accumulating too much power for themselves. Such a mentality also exposes the fact that liberals are not too fond of democracy themselves and have little regard for the will of the people. They harp on about democracy only when it suits them. They bat for unelected people to make major decisions on law and policy when it suits them. Only the victory of their ideology matters while the means can differ as per their convenience, the rest is irrelevant. The fact that liberals are cheering for judicial activism reveals the extent to which they are committed to their ideology. They care very little for the opinions and traditions of the laymen. As long as their ideological positions succeed, democracy is a very little price to pay. The dangerous aspect of such a vociferous support for judicial activism is it makes people sympathetic to illiberal forms of governments. If the people they have elected as their representatives do not voice their concerns and do not serve their interests while unelected people make decisions for them, why shouldn’t they turn to a tyrant who promises both of those things? You won’t be able to convince people that a tyrant should not be looked up to because he will not respect their wishes if unelected people in a democracy are overriding elected representatives anyway and making decisions beyond their mandate. It’s a dangerous precedent to set and liberals should be wise enough to refrain from cheering for judicial activism. The gravest problem with unelected people taking sweeping decisions in a democracy is that it undermines the very notion of accountability. India is a Republic, therefore the decision falls on elected representatives to take decisions on behalf of the populace. Therefore, they are accountable for their decisions to his constituents. But a Judge is accountable to no one and nothing. If judges encroach on the domain of the legislative, who will the people hold accountable? The end result of all of this will be people losing faith in the system itself and they might very well turn towards a tyrant who promises to listen to their concerns and serve their interests. Even Markande Katju, a former Justice of the Supreme Court who is certainly not a fan of the rightwing, disagrees vehemently with the “perilous unpredictable path of over activism” that the Supreme Court has embarked upon. Judicial activism undermines the very basis of democracy. That liberals are cheering for it will further endanger democracy as their opponents will soon return fire with fire and abandon adherence to democratic principles for ideological victory. Because if liberals are not playing fairly and are openly discrediting democracy for ideological victories, then why should their opponents let democracy get in the way of victories in the ideological front?",2018-09-28,"Barkha Dutt,democracy,Indian democracy,judicial activism,Liberals,Markandey Katju,Sabarimala,supreme court",‘Liberals’ prove that they are willing to trample over democracy for sake of ideological supremacy,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/liberals-prove-that-they-are-willing-to-trample-over-democracy-for-sake-of-ideological-supremacy/

That was on a baseless issue of Sahara-Birla dairy entries, in which the Supreme Court dismissed  a plea by Prashant Bhushan demanding an inquiry into the matter. The SC had asked the petitioner to ‘bring better material ‘. and refused to order any probe first on 15 December 2016, and then dismissed  the matter forever on 11 January 2017 saying ‘loose sheets are not evidence’ after giving the petitioner almost a month to bring ‘better material’. Despite the SC finding no merit in the case on 15 Dec 2016, Rahul Gandhi repeated the same charges till 11 January 2017 at least and went to the extent of demanding  the Prime Minister’s resignation on 27 Dec 2016. Then in September 2018 he again called the Prime Minister a ‘thief’, and alleged a ‘scam’ in the Rafale deal where none exists, or at least, where none has been proven till now, and this issue doesn’t seem to have been taken up even by other Opposition parties other than the Congress. Rahul Gandhi said on 22 Sept 2018 that was he was ‘absolutely convinced ‘ that the ‘Prime Minister is corrupt’. Narendra Modi is known as an honest and incorruptible man, and not even the very hostile media which demonized him for 12 years from 2002 to 2014 ever accused him of being personally corrupt. Rahul Gandhi’s party itself is in a ditch, and he is desperate to make some mud stick on the BJP, especially the Prime Minister. He is also facing a case of financial misdeeds of his own, namely the National Herald case. He hopes that his charges on the Prime Minister will deflect attention from his own case. Twitter duly trended #RahulKaPuraKhandanChor (“Entire family of Rahul is a thief”). But there is already a case where there is foolproof evidence of his party (he and his mother) saving a corrupt man, who had named Sonia Gandhi as being involved in the case on tape! The CBI was called a ‘Caged Parrot’ by the Supreme Court of India during the UPA regime (May 2004- May 2014). On the UPA’s order, the CBI tried to frame the present BJP chief Amit Shah and Rajasthan ex-Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria. But what had the CBI done on another case with evidence? Congress leader and former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi once split  the BJP in Chhattisgarh in December 2001, when he walked away with 12 MLAs  through money power when he was Chief Minister. In December 2003 Assembly elections were held for Chhattisgarh state for the first time, and the BJP won a full majority winning 50 out of 90 seats while the Congress unexpectedly lost power, reduced to only 37 out of 90 seats. Ajit Jogi was said to have promised 75 seats  for the Congress to the then party chief Sonia Gandhi. Stunned by the electoral loss, Ajit Jogi as outgoing Chief Minister tried to split the BJP again after losing elections and form the Government. He wrote a letter to the then Governor saying, “Our Congress Party’s all 37 MLAs give their support to a government to be formed under the leadership of Baliram Kashyap, MP. Please give us the chance to form the government”. This letter of Jogi was openly brought out in the media on 6-7 December 2003 and Ajit Jogi admitted that he wrote the letter. Congress loyalist Outlook weekly itself gave a report  of this attempt to grab power by Jogi after losing polls in 2003. Congress was forced to suspend Ajit Jogi  after that immediately. But in March 2004, before the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress brought back  the tainted man. The same day as this letter went out (6-7 December 2003), an audio tape having a conversation between Ajit Jogi and a BJP leader of Chhattisgarh on phone was aired. In that tape, Jogi was talking of giving money to buy BJP MLAs to split the party. Jogi later said  that the letter to the Governor was his, but the voice in the tape was not his. But this lie was exposed by the forensic lab report which said that the voice in the tape was indeed of Ajit Jogi. This single lie itself is enough to nail Ajit Jogi. This report  shows that the lab said  it was Jogi’s voice indeed. But on 4th June 2012, the CBI under UPA said that it cannot prosecute Ajit Jogi and had filed  a closure report. For bribing the MLAs, 45 lakh+ rupees were paid in cash to a BJP leader, directly by Ajit Jogi and his son Amit Jogi. These 45 lakhs were first given  to Police and then handed over to the CBI as well on 15 February 2004 as per the Deccan Herald’s report of 16 Feb 2004. The CBI also traced  the Bank account from which the money was paid. Despite this clear evidence the CBI first said in January 2007 that it cannot prosecute Jogi and then again had said and done so in June 2012. But in January 2007, PTI reported that almost everyone in CBI was in favour  of prosecuting Ajit Jogi and wanted a chargesheet to be filed against him after the tape was proved to be genuine, but Additional Solicitor General of the UPA Government influenced/pressured/ advised CBI not to do so. As a result of this pressure, the CBI said  in May 2008 that there is no law to prosecute Ajit Jogi in this case. [This is the height of farcical excuses, there are many laws, e.g. Prevention of Corruption Act, under which he can be prosecuted.] In Feb 2006 CNN-IBN reported  that apart from having been charge-sheeted in the cash-for-MLAs scam, Jogi has also been named as a co-conspirator in the case of the murder of Chhattisgarh state NCP treasurer Ram Avtar Jaggi in 2003 after two of the several accused turned approver and gave statements in a Chhattisgarh court. Ajit Jogi was ultimately acquitted  in the case due to lack of sufficient evidence, but 19 were convicted, which included 4 Congress workers . The then NSUI state President, Ejaz Dhebar’s brother Yahyaha Dhebar was convicted and given life term, as was Chiman Singh, who actually shot Ramavtar Jaggi dead. Singh was a close associate  of Ajit Jogi. Now let us look at the contents of those conversations between Ajit Jogi and the then state BJP Vice-President Virendra Pandey who got the talk recorded and nailed Jogi in December 2003. First are some excerpts  of that talk between Jogi and Virendra Pandey carried by a Congress-loyalist weekly Outlook. Virendra Pandey pretended to fall for the bait of Ajit Jogi and got him nailed. Note that this Congress loyalist weekly carefully deletes the reference to Sonia Gandhi in the excerpts. And this tape has been proved to be genuine by the Forensic Lab on 22 Jan 2006. “The Transcript Virender Pandey is Chhatisgarh state BJP vice-president. ‘Khunte’ referred to in the conversation is the BJP MP who had defected to the Congress before the (2003) elections. Now, of course, he claims that he was under pressure. Ajit Jogi: Hello Congress loyalist weekly Outlook carefully deleted the reference to Sonia Gandhi in its excerpts published. Here is this reference included in excerpts  by another daily The Telegraph. The original tape and full text may have even more. Sonia Gandhi herself gave a statement  condemning Ajit Jogi in public claiming ‘high moral ground’ while re-embracing him again within 4 months, and even for many years after January 2006, when the tapes had been proved to be genuine. Ajit Jogi is a very cunning and a very dangerous  man. Note that former BJP chief Bangaru Laxman was convicted and given 4 years imprisonment on a fictitious case, where all the so-called dealers and deals were unreal. If he could be convicted for an imaginary thing, then Jogi can definitely be convicted for this real attempt to split the BJP giving 45 lakh in cash, which was given to CBI and this was second attempt to split the BJP after splitting once in 2001, also through money. All anti-corruption crusaders like Anna Hazare, Baba Ramdev etc should be asked to raise this issue to nail the CBI under UPA and the Congress for trying to let Jogi get away with this. Rahul Gandhi, of course, has no answer and no comments to make on this. He has no comments to make on many other issues of the Jogis, which we will see soon here, and many other issues as well. And CBI under UPA had ‘evidence’ against Amit Shah and Kataria, but not against Ajit Jogi! What ‘action against corrupt leaders’ by the UPA Government, as Sonia Gandhi had claimed so often! Sonia Gandhi is herself named as someone who gave full approval to this attempt to split the BJP by none other than Ajit Jogi himself in the tape. The use of Sonia’s name was condemned  by the Congress, but it re-embraced Ajit Jogi later, who had taken her name. Congress MP P R Khunte, who was in the BJP till November 2003 and defected to the Congress before the Assembly polls, and was said to be Jogi’s ‘prize catch from the BJP’ and involved in the failed attempt to break the BJP, also said that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had given her approval to break the BJP in Chhattisgarh, as reported by The Economic Times on 9 December 2003. Many people believe that the Rahul-Sonia combine had used CBI to fabricate cases against Narendra Modi’s aide Amit Shah and Rajasthan BJP leaders, and used this same CBI to save their ‘blue-eyed boy’ Ajit Jogi and their own skins. Ajit Jogi is also on record  saying as Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh that tribals are not Hindus. This is a blatant case of evidence of corruption, shielding the corrupt, misuse of CBI, etc by Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi was taken into full confidence by Ajit Jogi before his attempt to break the BJP, he confidently said to the person on phone “Do you wish to speak to her? Take this number and call her?” meaning that Sonia Gandhi had given full approval to the buying of BJP MLAs. And then it would seem like Sonia-Rahul combine saved Ajit Jogi in the case. And this Rahul Gandhi has the audacity to call the Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi as ‘corrupt’! The complainant Virendra Pandey had challenged this closure report by the CBI in court. In December 2013, the CBI was ordered  to continue probing this case vs Jogi by the court. The efforts of the complainant Virendra Pandey need to be appreciated, while the role of the mainstream media in suppressing this case needs to be condemned by one and all. When the AAP was claiming ‘moral high ground’ and ‘fighting corruption’ in December 2013, it was urged many times to raise this issue of Ajit Jogi being saved by UPA, before the elections in Chhattisgarh in December 2013, but it too kept a stony silence. Now, dear Mr Rahul Gandhi, will you break your silence on this case?",2018-09-27,"Ajit Jogi,BJP,Congress,Corruption,Horsetrading,rahul gandhi,sonia gandhi,UPA","Since Rahul Gandhi likes talking about ‘corruption’ now, will he speak on Ajit Jogi naming Sonia in Cash-For-MLA scam?",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/rahul-gandhi-sonia-gandhi-ajit-jogi-cash-for-mla-scam-tapes-cbi-corruption/
497,OpIndia Staff,"A poster with a group of State leaders of the Congress party along with the party president, Rahul Gandhi, depicting the respective caste groups the leaders belonged to emerged  on Wednesday in Patna. The poster displays a group photograph of state Congress leaders with their President Rahul Gandhi and has the caste of each person printed on the front. The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee was revamped last week with the appointment of new office-bearers. Siddharth Kshatriya, a former secretary of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) put up a poster in Patna to thank Congress president Rahul Gandhi on appointing new office bearers  in the party’s Bihar unit. The poster, along with the pictures of the new office-bearers also mentioned  the individual caste of the leaders. The poster exposing the caste-based politics the party resorts to read:  The BJP state spokesperson lambasting at the Congress said,  JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar, strongly criticising Congress’ tactics said that the poster exposes the party’s real face.  This is not the first time Congress has taken recourse  to caste-based politics. During the buildup to the Gujarat elections, the Congress party had surprised  many by openly declaring its intention to woo Hindus, with Rahul Gandhi going on a literal “temple run” during the state’s campaign. The party further ‘saffronised’ Rahul as a Janeu-dhari Shiv Bhakt’ when rumours spread  about his name being registered in the non-Hindu register of the Somnath temple. We have seen Congress supporting  Bhim Army in Uttar Pradesh. They fanned the Bhima-Koregaon violence hailing the protests and blaming BJP for ignoring Dalits. While playing these caste-based politics the party has methodically used  the Rohit Vemula suicide case, extended support to people like Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani in their attempt to appease the Dalits. They have also tried to encash the ‘Lingayat ‘ card prior to the Karnataka elections. In fact, the deep-rooted, horrendous, casteist bias of the Congress Party was boldly out in the open when their loyalist Mani Shankar Aiyer had audaciously passed a casteist remark  calling PM Modi a ‘neech’ aadmi. The Congress subsequently revoking Mani Shankar’s suspension, which had come in lieu of his ‘neech’ comment furthered  the parties penchant. Sonia Gandhi, the party supremo, reportedly too had used  the same word to describe Modi in 2014, at a rally in Kushinagar (UP). While the Congress desperately tries to prove itself to be a secular party, comments coming from party veterans like Ghulam Nabi Azad referring to Modi as a “Gangu Teli” (Modi comes from the Teli caste) itself proves the deep-seeded casteist mindset of the party. It is being alleged that with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has finally taken a call to again play the upper caste card by appointin g veteran party leader Madan Mohan Jha, a Brahmin, as the new Pradesh Congress Committee chief in Bihar. To woo the forward caste vote bank in the state, the party has named Akhilesh Prasad Singh, a Bhumihar, as the chief of the campaign committee for 2019 Lok Sabha polls.",2018-09-27,"Bhima Koregaon,Bihar,BJP,caste politics,Congress,dalit,Janeudhari Shiv Bhakt,Lingayat,Loksabha 2019,Neech,Patna,PM Modi,poster war,posters,rahul gandhi,sonia gandhi",Poster issued by Congress leader in Bihar exposes Congress’ casteist mentality,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/poster-issued-by-congress-leader-in-bihar-exposes-congress-casteist-mentality/
498,OpIndia Staff,"On 24th September 2018, Congress’ IT Cell head, Divya Spandana took to Twitter to share a morphed image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This comes after the Congress has been trying its best to insinuate a scam in the Rafale deal signed between India and the French government where they exist none. Recently, the trail led up to the Gandhi family itself when it was revealed that the infamous arms dealer, Sanjay Bhandari, who is allegedly a close associate of Robert Vadra was lobbying at the time to become Dassault’s offset partner. Lawyer and activist Syed Rizwan Ahmed took strong objection to Spandana’s tweet. He tweeted his objected to Divya several times and also urged her to delete the tweet. Mr Ahmed then said that he was so angry at the tweet by Spandana, that it had prompted him to support BJP. A proposition he would have laughed off earlier. On 25th September 2018, a day after Divya Spandana tweeted the morphed image of PM Modi with “chor” written on his forehead, Dr Syed Rizwan Ahmed tweeted that he had filed a case of sedition against the Congress IT Cell head. The FIR filed by Dr Ahmed has been filed under the sections 124A of the IPC and a provision of the IT Act. Section 124A pertains to sedition and reads “whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government estab­lished by law in 103 [India], shall be punished with 104 [im­prisonment for life], to which fine may be added, or with impris­onment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine. OpIndia.com spoke to Dr Syed Rizwan Ahmed and asked him why he chose to file an FIR invoking harsh sedition laws. Dr Ahmed said: OpIndia.com, while speaking to Dr Ahmed also asked him what he would say to someone who would counter his FIR by saying that ‘dissent is the safety valve of democracy’ and that his complaint perhaps stifles dissent. Dr Ahmed said: While Dr Syed Rizwan Ahmed has already filed an FIR against Divya Spandana, another lawyer, Vibhor Anand, who had given her a 24-hour deadline to take the tweet down has asserted that he will be filing a Rs. 10,000 crores defamation suit against the Congress IT Cell head.

499,OpIndia Staff,"Rahul Gandhi has been on the campaign trail for upcoming elections. Today, Rahul Gandhi is delivering a rally speech in Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh. Rahul Gandhi seems to be running out of lies to further because he has come a full circle and is now repeating the same lies over and over again. During his rally in Chitrakoot, Rahul Gandhi said that Prime Minister Modi is making Sardar Patel’s statue in Gujarat and like our shirts and shoes, this statue too is going to be ‘Made in China’. In the year 2015, Outlook had claimed  that L&T had given the work of constructing the statue to a Chinese Foundry. The article mocked Modi’s “Make in India” campaign, by branding the Patel statue as “Made in China”. We had debunked  this lie by Outlook in 2015 itself. L&T had in fact issued two statements  countering this baseless story. However, facts should not be allowed to get in the way of propaganda and Rahul Gandhi seems to firmly believe in that saying. On 26th September 2017, Rahul Gandhi while speaking at a rally had repeated this long debunked lie  and claimed that this move would end up providing jobs in China and not India. Then too, we had reiterated that this was a blatant lie. But since a lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth, Rahul Gandhi has decided not to be deterred by pesky little facts. He has repeated the same lie today in his Madhya Pradesh rally. Perhaps the most tragic part is that the media, which has repeatedly behaved like Nero’s guest, have maintained stoic silence as Rahul Gandhi repeats the same lie a thousand times. Perhaps it is the silence of the media that gives Rahul Gandhi the impunity necessary to lie blatantly and we won’t be surprised if he gets a free pass from the media this time as well.",2018-09-27,"Congress,Congress lies,Madhya Pradesh,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,sardar patel,statue",Madhya Pradesh: Rahul Gandhi repeats the same debunked lie on Sardar Patel’s statue,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/madhya-pradesh-congress-rahul-gandhi-repeats-the-same-debunked-lie-on-sardar-patels-statue/
500,Nirwa Mehta,"Rahul Gandhi is obsessed with mobile phones. Any city he goes to, he insists that a mobile phone manufacturing facility is set up there. Considering he tweets like a teenaged girl, with heart emojis and all, instead of prime minister aspirant, one can understand his obsession with the mobile phones. After making mobile phones in Mumbai , Telangana , Uttar Pradesh  and Bhopal , Rahul Gandhi has now decided mobile phones will be made in Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh if Congress comes to power. Rahul Gandhi is so predictable that even before he made the big ‘Made in Chitrakoot’ announcement, people had already predicted he would mention the same. BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Bagga had tweeted minutes before Rahul Gandhi’s speech. One wonders what will the world do with so many mobile phones? No sooner had Rahul Gandhi uttered first words at the rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, #ChirkutinChitrakoot was trending on Twitter. Chirkut is a colloquial Hindi word for a foolish person. In fact, if you hear the clip closely, you could hear someone in the audience prompt Rahul Gandhi to speak about the mobile phones. Apparently, Rahul Gandhi is not just obsessed with mobile phones. Previously it was all about Congress trying to take credit that all products in India, from cars to computers, to have been brought by his family members who also doubled up as India’s prime ministers. Now, he is just redefining entrepreneurship. So one wonders why would Rahul Gandhi indulge in something that’s now so repetitive, that it’s boring his own fans? Are his speech writers our of ideas? Or does he and his speechwriters think that people are idiots who will not see through this boring stupidity? Or is there a method to this madness? If one Twitter user is to be believed, Rahul Gandhi is perhaps doing this so if he comes back to power in any state, he will claim that he has put all those factories, considering India has seen a sharp rise in mobile phone manufacturing after the Modi government came to power. It is true that India has seen a tectonic shift in the mobile manufacturing industry . Recently, in July 2018, Samsung inaugurated the world’s largest mobile phone factory in Noida, India, which will roll out 120 million units per year. India has attracted investment from 37 mobile manufacturing companies recently and In 2017, India became the world’s second largest mobile phone producer after the proportion of global handsets produced in India increased from 3% in 2014 to 11% in 2017. Even Foxconn’s competitor and Apple’s largest contract manufacturer Wistron is also investing  INR 3000 crores (US$ 450 million) for setting up a manufacturing unit in Karnataka which will produce 100 million units every year and will generate thousands of jobs. Rahul Gandhi’s repetition is bordering on hilarity now. Not just people on Twitter, but even those ‘supporters’ attending his rally could predict what he is going to talk about. Why would he do that? Is he short of ideas? Does he think everyone is naive or as the Twitter user pointed out, he repeats the same gibberish so he can later claim the credit if he ever comes back to power?

501,OpIndia Staff,"Nowadays Congress “Crown Prince” Rahul Gandhi eats Rafale, drinks Rafale, sleeps Rafale. French fighter jet Rafale we mean, not some soft drink brand. He has been making outrageous and bizarre allegations about the deal between governments of India and France. But his one tweet today in this matter has left us dumbfounded, as we are unable to decipher the tweet. The tweet is addressed to officers and jawans of Indian Air Force, and the families of pilots who were martyred in duty. And the tweet is also addressed to everyone who ever worked for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). He says that he understands their pain, he knows how they feel, and he will bring to justice who dishonoured and stole from them. The tweet includes two images of Amar Jawan Jyoti located at Rajpath, New Delhi. This is one of the most confusing tweets that we have encountered. Rahul Gandhi talks about martyrs of Indian Air Force and giving them justice. And we agree, the martyrs of IAF deserve justice, especially those who died during peacetime in various crashes. India has the rare distinction of losing more fighter planes and pilots during peacetime than war. Most brave pilots of IAF have lost their lives during routine peacetime flights, not during dangerous dogfights engaging enemy aircraft or bombing enemy territories. The MiG21, which was the main fighter plane of IAF till recently, is actually known as purchased   in India, given its very high rate of crashes. India had  There have been questions about the quality of the planes due to frequent crashes. In an explosive revelation , a top-level Russian defence official had said that India was buying substandard parts for MiG21 from third parties. He blamed the tender system followed by India to buy parts at the lowest price because genuine parts can be sourced only from fresh productions in Russia, but India was buying as high as 90 per cent of parts from old stocks left in former Soviet nations like Ukraine, Kazakhstan etc. The official alleged that those old parts were just painted over and spruced up by suppliers in those countries who place bids in India, and said that India was accepting those parts without any question. Of course, MiG21 is not the only plane operated by IAF to have faced a high rate of crashes, almost all other planes have suffered peacetime losses due to accidents and crashes, including other versions of MiG. Several of them are assembled in India by HAL under licence from respective manufacturers. At present the Sukhoi Su-30MKI is the main fighter of Indian Air Force, this advanced Russian jet is also made in India by HAL. In the last 20 years, India has lost  as many as 7 Sukhoi planes to crashes, a very high figure for an advance plane like Sukhoi, while its causality count during the war is zero. Human error is not the only reason for the crashes, faulty parts and poor maintenance is also a reason. Is Rahul Gandhi making HAL responsible for these unfortunate crashes and deaths? Therefore, Rahul Gandhi is indeed correct in demanding justice for the death of IAF pilots. But he is targeting whom? MiG21 was bought and assembled in India during various Congress governments. Will he initiate a case against Jawaharlal Nehru government which decided to buy MiG21, HAL which assembled it, and subsequent governments which bought faulty parts, to give justice to the martyrs?  The Amar Jawan Jyoti was built in memory of soldiers martyred in India-Pakistan war of 1971 when Indira Gandhi was prime minister of India. Is Rahul Gandhi prosecuting the Indira Gandhi government for justice of 1971 war martyrs? Coming to HAL, what pain of its workers? Has the company been shut down? Is it being downsized? No. In the year 2017-18 its turnover  was over ₹18,000 crore, which has been rising steadily every year. Aircrafts currently made by the company include the Sukhoi, BAE Hawk, Tejas LCA, HJT-36 trainer, several helicopters including Dhruv, Chetak, Cheetah etc. Yes, every company wants to win every bid, but is it right to cry victimhood if a bid is not won? Is the deal to make some parts for 36 Rafale jets is so vital that HAL employees are being compared with IAF pilots who gave their lives for the country? We need to reiterate here that all of the 36 Rafales that India is buying will be entirely made in France itself. As per offset clause of the deal, the suppliers will have to offset 50% of their deal value by either investing in India, buying from India, or transferring technology to Indian companies. Snecma Hal Aerospace, where HAL is a joint venture partner, has already been selected by HAL to be its offset partner, just like dozens  of others including Reliance, Mahindra, L&T etc. It is not a make or break deal for HAL. Offset obligations can be in any industry, not necessarily in fighter planes only. HAL is not even present in many sectors where offset investments or purchases will be made. Rahul Gandhi’s rhetoric is getting old and increasingly outlandish. What is surprising is the silence of Nero’s guests, who watch Rahul Gandhi burn down every brick that holds the wall of decent political rhetoric together.",2018-09-25,"air force,anil ambani,Army,Dassault,fighter jet,France,French government,HAL,IAF,indian air force,Rafale,rafale deal,Rafale jets,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi,Reliance,Twitter","The theatre of absurd: So absurd, that we are still trying to decipher what Rahul Gandhi meant",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/the-theatre-of-absurd-so-absurd-that-we-are-still-trying-to-decipher-what-rahul-gandhi-meant/
502,Sanghamitra,"Former PM Manmohan Singh is unusually vocal after Congress lost power in 2014 and PM Narendra Modi assumed office. The former PM, who was rather well known for his ‘lack of statements’ is often found making highly intellectual, grandiose, philosophical statements that involve a lot of fear-mongering, doom predictions and pontifications. Most of his speeches are centred around ideas like ‘secularism is in danger’, ‘democracy is in danger’ and ‘the economy is in danger’. The same Manmohan Singh whose secularism is defined by his famous remark of minorities having the first claim  on a country’s resources. Recently, speaking at a lecture event, the former PM stated that the Indian Army must remain ‘uncontaminated’ from a sectarian appeal. He also stated that even the judiciary of the country should not lose sight of its primary duty of protecting the secular spirit of the constitution. As usual, Manmohan Singh, considered a Sonia Gandhi loyalist through and through, serves the dual purpose in the statement. He casts an allusion that the Army and the judiciary are under threat of becoming sectarian, communal. Further, he asserts the claim that he, as a former PM and senior Congress leader, is warning against the possible threats ‘if’ the institutions like the army and the judiciary become sectarian. But what the former prime minister says now, and what he did when he was in power are diametrically opposite. While in power at the centre, the UPA government where Manmohan Singh was the PM, had brought in the Sachar committee to make an assessment of socio-economic conditions  of Muslims in the government, bureaucracy and well, in the army. Crucial assembly elections were close and the party that draws its legacy from people who ensured India’s partition on religious grounds had played its ‘secularism’ card  once again. Sadly, the Congress version of secularism means projecting the ‘Muslim’ community as a victim of socio-economic injustice. The Manmohan Singh led government was already trying its level best to exploit the ‘Muslim’ peg to reap political benefits. The HRD ministry had tried its best to make the Aligarh Muslim University as a strictly Muslim university by bringing in 50% reservation  for Muslims. The court struck it down. The Sachar committee was just another attempt to create the ‘secular’ smokescreen that Muslim in India are marginalised, under-represented, backward while the majority Hindus are grabbing their share of everything. The army, which had remained well beyond the confines of religious politics, was to be the next target. After strong opposition from the RSS, BJP and media outrage over the overtly malicious attempt to create a sectarian divide in the armed forces, the UPA government saw that its trick is not working and resorted to damage control mode. Soon, separate clarifications  were issued from the Sachar committee itself, the PMO and Congress party. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi ‘clarified’ to the media that the letter sent by the committee to the army is not an attempt to divide but a mere fact-finding exercise. What is worse is that the idea behind the Muslim headcount  and seeking ‘representation’ was reportedly drawn from a book named ‘Khaki and Ethnic Violence in India’ by an MIT professor named Omar Khalidi. In the book, Khalidi had reportedly advocated the creation of ‘Muslim compact zones’ in states like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar by ‘reorganisation’ of districts. Some secularism indeed. Recently, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi had created a controversy by demanding to know how many Muslims  have been recruited by the Indian security forces. The fact that a Congress leader openly supported the demand should be no surprise at all. Because what Owaisi declares openly, Congress has been doing it subtly over the years, under a fancy garb of secularism. In the lust for power, Congress had exploited all possible faultlines  in the Indian society, be it caste, region and religion. The central idea behind these statements and Congress’ policies over the years is the same . A fake narrative building to exploit faultlines, create fear and then appear like the white knight who will save India from the imaginary demons. Congress had applied the same narrative building game to create the smokescreen called the ‘Hindu Terror’ . When in power they attempted to create another narrative of Muslims being the victims, which they are only further extending now with the allusions of ‘secularism’ being under threat. Manmohan Singh can use his intellectual prowess to weave a narrative of brilliant words with smart undertones. But he cannot stop the average Indian from noticing that his proclamations of danger to India’s social, democratic and economical fabric have been as flimsy as his own tenure as the PM of India where the real power laid elsewhere, that Congress’ slogans of secularism are as hollow as the promises of its leadership over the years.",2018-09-26,"BJP,Congress,Defence Ministry,Economy,indian armed forces,Indian Army,manmohan singh,nda government,PM Narendra Modi,Pseudo-secularism,RSS,Secular,Secularism,sonia gandhi,UPA government",Manmohan Singh’s pontification on ‘secularism’ in the Army is as hollow as his prime ministership,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/manmohan-singhs-pontification-on-secularism-in-the-army-is-as-hollow-as-his-prime-ministership/
503,K Bhattacharjee,"The 6th of December, 1992 could be regarded as the most important event in the history of independent India. The date has assumed such enormous significance that the entire political history of India since independence can be divided into pre-06/12/92 and post it. Of course, mere words cannot impress upon people the importance of the events of that day when the Babri Masjid fell and our politics, to this day, continues to be affected by the events that transpired during that epoch. The Ayodhya dispute is not merely a disagreement marked by a cataclysmic event, it is an indictment. It is an indictment of the institutions of our state, it is an indictment of our Judiciary that has failed to reach a decisive verdict thus far, it is an indictment of our legislature that has failed to respect the religious sentiments of a long-oppressed people, it is an indictment of the political landscape of our country that has little respect for our civilizational memory. Indeed, the Ayodhya dispute is the harshest indictment of our Judiciary. In 2010, the Allahabad High Court did pronounce a verdict in the matter where the disputed land was to be divided into equal portions between three entities: Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha, Sunni Waqf Board and the Nirmohi Akhara. But only a couple of months later, an appeal was filed against the verdict in the Supreme Court and it has been languishing in the highest court of the country ever since. It reflects poorly on the Judiciary of independent India that a dispute on such a critical matter has been languishing in the courts since 1949 when civil suits were first filed in independent India for ownership of the plot. Indeed, it is the longest running civil dispute in the country and dates back to 1885. “I visited the land in dispute yesterday in the presence of all parties. I found that the Masjid built by Emperor Babur stands on the border of Ayodhya, that is to say, to the west and south it is clear of habitations. It is most unfortunate that a Masjid should have been built on land specially held sacred by the Hindus, but as that event occurred 356 years ago, it is too late now to agree with the grievances.” These are the words that were uttered  by the District Judge, Faizabad in 1886 when Mahant Raghubar Das moved the Courts to seek permission to build a Ram Mandir outside the Babri premises. We were not an independent country then but we are now and the righting of a historical wrong committed on its people is the duty and a true test of sovereignty for any newly independent nation. Hindus have been struggling hard for a Mandir at Janambhoomi in the Courts for decades. And it could be argued that Judges during the early years of independent India were respectful of Hindu sentiments and made several concessions. On the 16th of January, 1950, a civil suit was filed by a certain Gopal Singh Visharad in the Faizabad Court requesting that he be allowed to offer prayers to worship Shri Rama at His birthplace and a permanent injunction against the removal of Idols from the Masjid. It is pertinent to mention that Hindus in 1949 had managed smuggle Idols of Rama and other Deities inside the Masjid. Modifying his earlier judgment on the 19th of January, 1950, the Judge ruled , “The parties are hereby restrained by means of the temporary injunction to refrain from removing the idols in question from the site of dispute and from interfering with the puja, etc, as at present carried on.” The Judge again confirmed his interim order a year later on the 3rd of March. “The undisputed fact remains that on the date of this suit the idols of Shri Bhagwan Ram Chandra and others did exist on the site and that worship was being performed…though under some restrictions put by the executives.” One of the most momentous events was perhaps the opening of the gates  of the Masjid to Hindu devotees following a court order in 1986. The foundations for the construction of the Mandir were perhaps laid down at that opportune moment. Arif Mohammad Khan, a senior politician who is claimed to have been involved in the thick of events, has stated that the gates of the Babri were opened to Hindus as part of a deal between Muslim leaders and the Congress party. According to him, it was a balancing act to ameliorate the sentiments of Hindus after Rajiv Gandhi succumbed to the Muslim fundamentalists and reversed the Supreme Court judgment on the Shah Bano case. “The announcement to reverse the SC judgement (Shah Bano case) and the removal of the locks happened within a span of two weeks. This to most people appeared as a balancing act and they hoped that now both the agitating parties would feel satisfied,” Khan told  IANS in an interview. Khan had previously parted ways with Rajiv Gandhi following the latter’s capitulation to the Muslim clergy. The facts on the matter, however, are abundantly clear although it is disputed by Marxist historians and certain Muslim bodies. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) confirmed  in 2003 after an excavation that structures under the Babri had “distinctive features associated with temples of north India”. Dr Meenakshi Jain, PhD from Delhi University who specializes in cultural studies, eloquently puts forth the mounting body of archaeological and historical evidence of a Temple that was destroyed at the site in a talk for the Srijan Foundation. Apart from the archaeological evidence, there is also a great deal of evidence which suggests that the site has been sacred for Hindus for centuries and Shri Rama’s association with it. There are multiple accounts from the 16th, 17th and the 18th centuries which mention Hindus offering prayers at what they believed was the birthplace of the King of Ayodhya. Even according to official records from the past, the Babri Masjid was called Masjid-i-Janmasthan. According to British sources as well, Hindus offered prayers at the site in the 19th century. The dispute exposes the Marxist ecosystem which conspired to deny Hindus the right to worship Shri Rama at His birthplace. Dr K.K. Mohammed, former Regional Director (North) of the ASI, says in his autobiography that Leftist historians prevented an amicable settlement of the Ayodhya dispute. He claimed that an excavation at the site in 1978 by a team of archaeologists he was a member of found evidence of a Hindu Temple. The team was headed by Professor B.B. Lal, then director general of ASI. “The Babri issue would have been settled long ago if the Muslim intelligentsia had not fallen prey to the brainwashing by the Leftist historians. A set of historians including Romila Thapar, Bipin Chandra and S Gopal argued that there was no mention of the dismantling of the temple before the 19th century and Ayodhya is Bhudhist-Jain centre. They were supported by historians Irfan Habib, RS Sharma, DN Jha, Suraj Ben and Akthar Ali,” he told  Firstpost. Thus, we see a Judiciary that hasn’t been able to deliver a final verdict on the Ayodhya dispute for decades. We see a political climate where regular concessions are made to Hindus to ensure that political parties don’t suffer electorally. We see an academia that actively pursues the subversion of history to deny Hindus their right. India was partitioned in 1947 and the entire swathe of land was converted to an Islamic country where the lives of Hindus became hell and continues to be hell and yet after all these years, Hindus do not even have the Bhavya Ram Mandir they so desperately seek. We can all agree with the fact that what happened during the Ram Janambhoomi movement and the subsequent demolition was by no means an ordinary sequence of events. Kameshwar Chaupal is a Dalit Karyakarta who was awarded the honour of laying the first brick for the foundations of the Mandir at Ram Janambhoomi. He told  a magazine, “I can tell you that no one could have stopped that tide. I don’t know what happened. There were walls that  The entire country was catapulted into a different trajectory that day. The rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party can be attributed to the days of the Ram Janambhoomi Movement and the Hindu consolidation that it ignited. The BJP has come a long way since then and yet, there appears to be no certainty with regards to the Temple. However, there is plenty to be optimistic about regarding the future. Hindu issues have gathered momentum and there is a conscious awareness among Hindus about the need to preserve our identity and the imminent dangers that it is faced with. The rise of Narendra Modi has also felicitated and inspired many to render their service for the cause of the Hindu civilization. The results of the Ram Janambhoomi movement also highlights the limited scope of success for activism about Hindu issues. Hindu intellectuals appear to be of the opinion that the reason the Left is so successful is that they are more effective at activism than Hindus. That, if Hindus take to the streets to highlight the injustices they suffer, their concerns will be taken seriously and they might achieve their goal. In reality, the matter is slightly more complicated. The Ram Janambhoomi movement was by far more potent than any march or rally the Left has been able to organize in India ever. And yet, the Left has achieved success in almost every case it focuses its activism on but even after almost three decades after the Babri demolition, there isn’t any certainty regarding a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Thus, it demonstrates that the reason the Left has achieved so much success is not their activism. The real reason the Left has succeeded, it appears, is because they have managed to indoctrinate the elites of our country about the superiority of their ideas. And as a consequence, their ideas have come to dominate the corridors of power where decisions on important policies that govern the country are made. And unless and until Hindus can occupy the corridors of power themselves, their activism will not bear fruit. The actual purpose of activism is merely to demonstrate that the policies that the Left wants to impose, and probably will impose anyway regardless of public opinion, have popular support. There is certain vibrancy among political Hindus these days and an urgency is felt to establish a political climate and an academia that respects Hindu concerns and pays homage to the ancient history of our nation. It will, of course, take time for such endeavours to yield fruits. They will falter and fall and rise again over a long period of time before they taste success. It is easy to lose confidence and quit but patience is the key. They have indeed been granted a great boon when Narendra Modi emerged on the national scene. His immense popularity grants them the space they need to learn from their mistakes so that they can succeed in the future. Amidst all these developments, we should remember all that we are witnessing today in Indian politics is a consequence of the Ram Janambhoomi movement.",2018-09-25,"Allahabad High Court,Archaeological Survey of India,Ayodhya dispute,Babri Masjid,BJP,Congress,Jai Shri Ram,Marxist historian,Narendra Modi,rajiv gandhi,ram janambhoomi,supreme court",The History and Legacy of the Ram Janambhoomi Movement,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/the-history-and-legacy-of-the-ram-janambhoomi-movement/
504,OpIndia Staff,"Just a day after Rahul Gandhi promised justice for IAF soldiers and martyrs, most of whom have been victims of crashes in planes bought by previous Congress governments and made by HAL, the Deputy Chief Air Staff has rebutted Rahul Gandhi’s allegations about the Rafale deal. In an exclusive  interview with India Today, Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar has cleared the misinformation being spread about the size of offset business that Anil Ambani led Reliance is getting. Flatly refuting the allegation of Reliance getting offset business worth ₹30,000 crore in the Rafale deal, Nambiar said that IAF has been part of the commercial negotiation for the purchase of MMRCAs, and no single party is getting business of that much amount, not even Dassault. Making a very significant revelation he said, “People are perhaps misinformed. We were a part of the commercial negotiations for Rafale. There is nothing like ₹30,000 crore to any one party. Dassault has to do offsets to a tune of ₹6,500 crore. Not more than that”. Rahul Gandhi has been alleging that ₹30,000 has been “stolen from HAL and given away to a given to a man with no SKILLS in making aircraft”. It is important to note that the offset obligation of Dassault is ₹6,500 crore, not ₹30,000 as being alleged by the Congress party. Many would perhaps wonder how that is possible since the Rafale deal is around ₹58,000 crore and hence the offset obligation should ideally be ₹29,000 crore. One could ask why IAF deputy chief is saying that it is ₹6,500 crore only? The IAF deputy chief’s statements would mean that the deal with Dassault is worth ₹13,000 crore. To understand this, we need to know how aeroplanes are purchased. They are not bought as one piece like a car, but the major components are bought separately from respective manufacturers which are fitted into the plane by the manufacturer of the plane. In case of civilian aircraft, separate deals are signed with aircraft makers (Boeing, Airbus etc) and engine makers (GE, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney etc). In the case of fighter jets, the number of components and their supplier is much more, and buyers deal directly with them. Apart from the main airframe, a fighter plane has an engine, weapon systems, missiles, radar systems, electronic warfare systems, evasion systems, ejection seats etc, all of which are made by different companies. In case of the Rafale deal, there are four main suppliers, Dassault, Safran which makes the engine, Thales which makes several electrical, electronic systems and sensors, and MBDA which will supply missiles. The jets will carry advance missiles like Meteor and Scalp, and cutting-edge RBE 2 AESA radar. That’s why Dassault’s share in the deal is ₹13,000 crore, as the rest amount will be paid to other component and weapon suppliers. It this, the Thales deal is around $2 billion, and they have their own offset obligation  of $1 billion, or around ₹7,250 crores. The Rafale will also have several Israeli components, including the Litening pod. All these companies will have to fulfil their offset obligations. Thales has formed a joint venture with Reliance Defence, while the company already  have a JV with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). Safran has a Joint venture with HAL to make parts for the engine. Apart from the JV with Reliance, Dassault has signed agreements with several companies including BEL, L&T, Mahindra etc. Therefore it is clear that Reliance can’t get ₹30,000 from the deal as Rahul Gandhi alleges. That is more than the approximate figure Dassault and Thales is receiving in total, which whom Reliance Defence has JVs. Reliance has already said  that its share in the offset is ₹6,600. According to IAF sources, the share of DRDO in offset is highest. The Air Marshal also added that India has got a better price, better maintenance terms, better delivery schedule, and a better performance logistics package in the deal to buy 36 fighter jets. This assertion by Indian Air Force proves that Rahul Gandhi is spreading nothing but lies about the Rafale deal, which is being busted on a regular basis.",2018-09-26,"BJP,Congress,Dassault,DRDO,HAL,indian air force,modi government,Narendra Modi,Rafale,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Reliance,UPA",Indian Airforce Deputy Chief calls out Rahul Gandhi’s Rafale mumbo jumbo,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/indian-airforce-deputy-chief-calls-out-rahul-gandhis-rafale-mumbo-jumbo/
505,OpIndia Staff,"On September 25, Congress mouthpiece National Herald reported  that Japan has stopped providing funds for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. In an article titled “PM Modi’s Bullet Train dream derails after Japan stops funding”, it had reported that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has stopped funding for the project. The report states that the funding agency is not happy with the farmers’ protest over land acquisition for the ambitious project, and it has released only ₹125 crore against a total commitment of ₹80,000 crore for the project. This was reported  by some other media houses too. Few hours after the report was published, India had rubbished it. National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL), the nodal agency for the execution of the project, had said  that the report is false and not based on facts. “In fact, the GoI and JICA have already signed a loan agreement of about 10 billion yen and no payment is pending from JICA as on date,” NHSRCL had said in a statement. NHSRCL had stated that it is committed to the interest of the farmers. Several farmers affected by land acquisition are demanding more compensation and other amenities like common ponds, schools, solar lights and doctors in their villages. They have also written to Japan government and JICA with their demands. Gujarat BJP president Jitu Vaghani, who shared the statement issued by NHSRCL, told reporters , “I condemn the misinformation campaign against the project being carried out by the Congress leaders. They are anti-Gujarat and anti-development. There is no merit in the claims that JICA has stopped funds for the project” After India, today Japanese Ambassador to India refuted  the allegations. Ambassador Kenji Hiramatsu said that they are going to continue the fund for the ambitious project and there is no truth in the report that funding has been stopped. The Ambassador said, “Everything is going very well. We are very happy, there is a collaboration between Japan/Indian authorities on this project”. Hiramatsu also said that the project would be completed within the 2022 deadline for the project. This is not the first time that Congress mouthpiece National Herald has been caught lying.

506,OpIndia Staff,"Within a week of the government of India bringing an ordinance making it an offence to practise ‘Triple Talaq’, a petition has been filed  in the Bombay High Court challenging the ordinance. A petition was filed last Friday by the former municipal councillor Masood Ansari, NGO ‘Rising Voice Foundation’ and advocate Devendra Mishra. According to them, the provisions of the ordinances are “illegal, null, void, unreasonable and arbitrary”. “ President Ram Nath Kovind had last Wednesday signed the ordinance, according to which giving instant triple talaq has been made illegal and will attract a jail term of three years for the husband. The petitioners have now approached the court  and asked for an interim stay on those sections of the ordinance which criminalises the act of pronouncing talaq by a Muslim husband. It is reported that the division bench of the High Court will take the issue on September 28. The Union government had introduced the bill after varied and detailed public discussion on the bill and also brought in some changes to allay the fears against the misuse of the law. The government had also included some safeguards  in the bill, such as providing for bail to the accused husband and provisions to withdraw the case after a settlement. The NDA government led by Narendra Modi decided to pass a bill after the historic judgement  of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Shayara Bano vs Union of India. A five-judge bench of the court had outlawed triple talaq calling it is an ‘arbitrary’ practice. The ruling party passed the bill in Lok Sabha but could not succeed in the upper house as it faced a stiff opposition from certain political parties. There is no political consensus on the bill, as parties like RJD, AIMIM, BJD, IUML and AIADMK were delaying the passage of the bill and the government had to pass an ordinance in this regard.

It won’t be repeated in the future. I am a human being and they often make mistakes”, said Waris Pathan, leading many people on social media to question whether he puts his religion above his duties as a lawmaker.

508,shwetashalini,"“Well doctor, what have we got – a republic or a monarchy,” asked an eager lady to Dr Benjamin Franklin as he was leaving the Philadelphia Convention which was wrought in secrecy. “A Republic – if you can keep it” replied the founding father of the oldest modern democracy in the World. One needs hardly say that the founding fathers of Modern democracy were as concerned with the principles of preservation as with the founding itself. Even before the days of the American Constitution James Madison in the Federalist papers notes the existence of different interest groups accentuated by various sentiments and views which had come up out of necessity. Many times these special interest groups gain ascendancy without the citizens’ awareness or concurrence. The deep-rooted partisan one-upmanship which characterizes American politics today proves the apprehensions of founding fathers true. Reference to rudimentary forms of Democracy is evident right from the most ancient text namely the Rigveda. We also find reference to the will of people upholding the Kings in their position in the Atharva Veda. Democracy as we know today has an ancient and dodgy past with everyone staking claim to its recent success while failures as usual stands orphaned. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Russia toyed with the idea of democracy, the philosophical victory of democracy over all other forms of government seemed final. Modern Democracy in the 21st century is, however, facing fresh challenges in the form of a non-democratic superpower who has come up to challenge this shortlived victory. The oldest modern democracy in the world is no longer as solemn in appearance losing its sheen after the recession years and the upcoming challenge from China. Democracy in India, on the other hand, stands as the biggest role model for the times to come. Democracy here in India had its fair share of challenges but the great survival instincts in the oldest civilization always saw it through. While our neighbours have gone through an extended period of Army Dictatorship or a tightly controlled media of the Chinese, India had proved to be an outlier in its success with democracy. Even the worst critics acknowledge that the better part of post-independent India has been peaceful at all points of time even while revolts (sometimes even violent) against the ruling establishment has not been uncommon in any region. As the world celebrates International Democracy Day, India stands as an outlier in South Asia for the rest of the world to emulate. Indian democracy never was supposed to be a success from the western point of view. While the western point of view doesn’t take into account the deep cultural roots binding this country together, their apprehensions did prima facie seem meritorious. According to pre-independence British thinker Strachey ‘India’ was merely a label of convenience, ‘a name which we give to a great region including a multitude of different countries’. In Strachey’s view, the differences between the countries of Europe were much smaller than those between the ‘countries’ of India. ‘Scotland is more like Spain than Bengal is like Punjab.’ In India, the diversities of race, language and religion were far greater. Unlike in Europe, these ‘countries’ were not nations; they did not have a distinct political or social identity. This, Strachey told his Cambridge audience, ‘is the first and most essential thing to learn about India – that there is not, and never was an India, or even any country of India possessing, according to any European ideas, any sort of unity, physical, political, social or religious’. It must come as a shock to these naysayers that the piece of land which doesn’t seem to have any political or social identity is a thriving democracy today. What these naysayers forgot to include was the cultural aspect which kept this nation together even while facing contradictions inherent in a diverse country. In comparison, the European countries knit together on language basis are facing a crisis in terms of confidence in democratic processes. EU did not exactly prove to be a paragon of democracy when the decision to introduce the Euro in 1999 was taken without any popular mandate. Only Denmark and Sweden held referendums on the matter (both said no). During the darkest days of the euro crisis, the euro-elite forced Italy and Greece to replace democratically elected leaders with technocrats. The European Parliament, an unsuccessful attempt to fix Europe’s democratic deficit, is both ignored and despised. In contrast, Indian Parliamentary proceedings and important debates are telecasted and discussed widely across the nation. In my opinion, Indian democracy too had its fair share of banes prime among it being the dynastic politics which started as back as during Independence. The one Nehru family which always thought this nation to be a family fiefdom more or less got away with its misadventures in governing this country for far too long. India has been struggling to break free from the clutches of dynastic politics which marred many democracies across the world. The first major challenge came from the south in the late 60s on the back of language agitation which saw the dynasty losing grip over vast parts of South permanently as the party continues to languish to this day. A few years prior to this, India curiously had the distinction of having the first democratically elected Communist party. It raised several eyebrows across the world but did fend off all communist tendencies till date as communists got ingrained in the democratic process. The Communist continued to have vast parts of India under its stranglehold via the democratic process. The democratic process continued to be undermined by the Emergency declared which saw the arrogance of the family coming out in the open in its most brute form. Indian democracy reacted and the people voted aggressively dealing a body blow to the party in the long term by creating strong regional rivals which could join along with the newly formed BJP in 1980. Indian democracy was slowly coming of age when began the phase of blatant appeasement which continues to this day. After the Shah Bano case where minorities were sought to be appeased, the nation erupted to right the historic wrong of not having the Ram Temple at the birthplace of Lord Ram. Political alignments changed and all who indulged in this sort of appeasement bit dust as many non-Congress governments came up across the country eventually leading to the first full term government without the ruling dynasty in it. There has been no looking back since then when India finally voted a humble man with poor origins to the highest corridors of power. It is of utmost importance to politicians like us that every man is an equal citizen with equal stakes at the highest corridors of power regardless of where he is born in. With nothing to show but a proven track record, sheer oratory brilliance and an intent to serve Mother India, Narendra Modi a man from a humble background came to power defying the powers that be. Indian democracy had won again – a big victory this time bringing the best out of democratic tradition. It has crossed a major hurdle where dynasty has become a bad word and all parties actively seek to disassociate itself from the tag. Unfortunately, another ailment grips this democratic system as we celebrate Democracy day – The single one family dynastic rule at the national level is replaced by a host of dynastic families cropping up in all regions of the country. I think a trend of a dynasty for each region has off late gained ground right from PDP in Kashmir to DMK in South. Most of the younger members of both the houses are by-products of one or the other families. As things stand today, India despite the dynastic tradition which it finds hard to shake off is still a beacon of hope in the world. Independent India has conducted elections which were largely free and fair and at regular intervals in line with the founding fathers. While elections alone don’t make a democracy, it helps that each citizen has a political stake in this nation and exercises his franchise at regular intervals. This, in my opinion, has been the biggest success of India even while suffering from dynastic politics. Mature democracies like India just like nascent ones require appropriate checks and balances on the power of elected government. Indian judiciary has time and again proved to be the appropriate check right from the days of Emergency. The same however can’t be said of media which has more often played to the tunes of the ruling family. When asked to bend, they drolled dealing a body blow to their credibility which got worsened with the advent of social media where everyone can raise a voice. As democratic institutions get strengthened and accountable under the present Modi Government, the trend of dynasty staying in the limelight looks bleak as an increasingly educated population asks questions of them. Globally, the Chinese with their supposed success story has burst the American myth of democracy as being the answer to all the ills of mankind. The founders of modern democracy such as James Madison and John Stuart Mill regarded democracy as a powerful but imperfect mechanism: something that needed to be designed carefully, in order to harness human creativity but also to check human perversity, and then kept in good working order, constantly oiled, adjusted and worked upon. While China with its stunning growth figures in recent decades can continue mocking the Democratic traditions, it conceals a far deeper problem. The 50 richest members of China’s National People’s Congress are collectively worth 60 times as much as the 50 richest members of America’s Congress. The inequity is far too glaring for a country which prides itself on communist traditions where the bourgeois needs to be dealt with. The bourgeois clearly seems to have taken over and the working class is ruled upon. It also needs to be seen whether the Chinese model of muzzling free voices and repeated brutal violation of human rights can be sustained over the long run in the modern world. Till then, the verdict on the non-democratic one-party rule will remain open. Democracy will continue to stutter, stumble and start but will not be easily out for technology will enable democratization of power and the requirement to be on the right side of public opinion. To conclude on a positive note, Alexis De Tocqueville once remarked that “Democracies always look weaker than they really are: they are all confusion on the surface but have lots of hidden strengths. Being able to install alternative leaders offering alternative policies makes democracies better than autocracies at finding creative solutions to problems and rising to existential challenges, though they often take a while to zigzag to the right policies.” I am surely not letting disillusionment with the political system grip me while incessantly working towards a better and stronger India.

According to the reports , a “sex CD” had become viral allegedly featuring Public Works Department Minister Rajesh Munat had rocked Chhattisgarh last year and Baghel was named one of the five accused in this matter. The CBI had filed a charge sheet against Bhaghel, journalist Vinod Verma, Kailash Murarka, Vijay Pandya, and trader Vijay Bhatia in this case.’   Even though the charges against him were bailable, Baghel pleaded to the court  that he is innocent, and said this is a political attack. Further, he said, he will neither apply for a bail  nor employ a lawyer and will begin a satyagraha in jail. The court then sent him to judicial custody and granted bail to journalist Vinod Verma, while removing charges of extortion against him. The Central Bureau of Investigation took over the investigation of two cases related to the circulation of a ‘sex CD’, allegedly involving a Chhattisgarh minister, in December last year. The CBI had arrested former journalist Vinod Verma last year and he was charged with non-bailable sections of extortion on a complaint by BJP leader Prakash Bajaj. Bajaj had alleged that he was threatened with the release of an explicit CD of his ‘aaka’ (master) unless he paid money. Reportedly, all the accused have been booked under  IPC sections 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 67A of the IT Act (whoever publishes or transmits or causes to be published or transmitted in the electronic form any material which contains sexually explicit act).

510,K Bhattacharjee,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been receiving support from unexpected quarters recently. Pakistani politicians and journalists are going overboard in their effusive praise for the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. Some of them have already heralded him as India’s next Prime Minister. Whenever one sees Pakistanis praise Rahul Gandhi and take sides with the Congress against Narendra Modi, one is reminded of senior Congress leader, Mani Shankar Aiyer and the manner in which he had remarked during an interview that Narendra Modi needs to be removed from his post if talks between the two countries were to proceed. The exact words he had used  were, “First, you need to remove Modi…otherwise the talks will not move forward.” Aiyer, of course, has also hailed  Jinnah for his role in the freedom movement and blamed Indian freedom fighters like Veer Savarkar for the partition. Aiyer has in the past blamed  India for a lack of dialogue between the two countries and complimented Pakistan for its commitment towards dialogue. Former External Affairs Minister and senior Congress leader had also praised  then Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif and slammed Narendra Modi during his visit to the country. Under such circumstances, it appears that the Pakistanis are merely returning a favour that is owed to the Congress party courtesy of the enormous generosity the grand old party of India has bestowed on them in the past. There is also a certain resemblance in the manner in which Narendra Modi is addressed by Pakistanis and members of the Congress party. Recently, Rahul Gandhi had unabashedly branded  Prime Minister Modi a thief. As if on cue, only a couple of days later, the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had dubbed  Modi a ‘small man’. Also, there was Aiyer who had called  Modi ‘neech’ ahead of the Gujarat elections, a remark that may have cost his party a victory. The Congress party has been working hard in recent times to shed its anti-Hindu image. Rahul Gandhi himself has been making pilgrimages to various Hindu shrines to impress voters with his religiosity. However, given the history of his party, it will perhaps require a couple of decades at the very least for that to happen. The close proximity that the Congress party appears to have with the Pakistanis certainly does them no favours. Rahul Gandhi also did himself no favours when he met  the Chinese ambassador to India during the Doklam dispute and the Congress then attempted to hide the fact that the meeting took place. Rahul Gandhi’s popularity among India’s traditional enemies is likely to have an impact on the results when the country moves to vote in the Lok Sabha elections next year. Rahul Gandhi might just succeed in reinventing the Congress as a party of Soft-Hindutva but he will find it much harder to gain the trust of the Indian masses if the narrative of collusion between the Congress party and Pakistani authorities gathers momentum. And right now, Rahul Gandhi appears to be more popular with Pakistanis than Indians.",2018-09-25,"BJP,Congress,India,mani shankar aiyar,Narendra Modi,Pakistan,rahul gandhi,Salman Khurshid,UPA","Rahul Gandhi seems to be more popular in Pakistan than India, and it is doing Congress no favours",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/rahul-gandhi-seems-to-be-more-popular-in-pakistan-than-india-and-it-is-doing-congress-no-favours/
511,Jhankar Mohta,"After selectively ignoring facts  in the Rafale deal, the politicians and journalists in India have now resorted to sharing links of a dubious website just to prove their point. The Congress IT cell head, Divya Spandan and the lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan, the usual suspects, kept the ball rolling by furthering the lies on Twitter. It was eventually picked up by former diplomat KC Singh, who once wanted journalists jailed  for not being anti-Modi enough. Swati Chaturvedi, the abusive troll masquerading as a journalist , also tried to add credibility to IndiaScoops ‘news’. Aam Aadmi Party supporter Krishan Pratap Singh also questioned why is the mainstream media not picking up the ‘scoop’ by ‘IndiaScoops’. Well, maybe mainstream media or any media for that matter is not ‘picking up the news’ is because the website is dubious and regularly shares unverifiable news. Earlier too, the website had shared news about PM Modi’s yoga video costing Rs. 35 lakh , which was widely shared by the same set of people. The latest ‘scoop ‘ by IndiaScoops is titled “Rafale Deal: Technical HODs at Dassault Aviation claim Reliance Defence was never the first choice, the decision to drop HAL was taken by CEO Eric Trappier at the last minute”. Let us try and find out details of the story. The article claims that ‘two top technical heads at Dassault Aviation’ gave an exclusive interview to IndiaScoops. IndiaScoops as a website was created on 27 April 2018, and two top technical heads at Dassault Aviation skip everyone else and give an exclusive interview to a six-month-old website which otherwise talks about ‘leaked nude and bikini pictures’ of actors. The person who created the website went for a premium account so as to mask their real identity. Very curious for a blog with about 10,000 likes on Facebook to spend so much and go to such length to hide their identity. What have they got to hide? The earliest mention of this website that we could find is by a Twitter handle ‘India Scribes Tv’. India Scribes TV is run by one Flynn Remedios, one ‘Bollywood publicist’. The same Flynn Remedios who appears in the ‘Popular Posts’ on IndiaScoops where one model had allegedly ‘claimed she was having an affair with Remedios but she later apologised after he sued her’. A bit about Flynn Remedios, who seems to be running the show here. In November 2010, a model and Kannada starlet had filed  a case of molestation against one Flynn Remedios. She had also accused him of cheating her of Rs. 4 lakh. In 2008, model Sherlyn Chopra had filed  a case against ‘freelance journalist’ Flynn Remedios who offered to become her public relations officer, for allegedly sending her outrageous SMSes. And recently, Remedios has described as Arshi Khan’s publicist . The same Arshi Khan whose Facebook page now became IndiaScoops.com page which has ‘exclusive sources’ in the PMO. Oh, and Arshi Khan and her publicist Flynn Remedios have been accused  by one Pandit Ramesh Joshi of not returning the money she borrowed as well as of sexual harassment. Speaking of Arshi Khan, IndiaScoops’ Facebook page was Arshi Khan fan page before it started speaking to technical heads at Dassault Aviation. It is indeed kind of intriguing that an erstwhile Arshi Khan fan page and a Bollywood publicist had earlier got sources in the PMO and now Dassault Aviation top technical heads, speak directly to them. But then how can a Bollywood publicist not have credible connections? We now look at the article they have published. The article claims that two ‘internal experts’ (earlier they were technical heads), spoke to IndiaScoops over the phone and ‘pointed out that there was a discussion between officials at Dassault Aviation and several emails were exchanged over a period of 7-8 days. The entire technical team wanted to work with HAL, but the decision was overruled by the top Dassault management headed by CEO Eric Trappier at the last minute.’ The two ‘internal experts’ doubling up as ‘technical heads’ at DA were ‘shocked’ when HAL was dropped and ‘a new Indian company with whom we had never worked before and which had no expertise in manufacturing fighter aircraft was selected for the job’. Umm. No one other than DA is making the jets . Reliance Defence (and HAL) are both offset partners, in different capacities, along with about 70 others, and both will manufacture some components. Perhaps the ‘experts’ need to brush up on their ‘expertise’. HAL is joint venture  dropped. HAL is still very much part of the deal. One of the names on the offset partners is that of Snecma HAL Aerospace Ltd which is a  Indian and French Governments have repeatedly asserted  that neither of the governments had any say in which commercial partner Dassault chooses. Despite that, IndiaScoops repeats the lie which the politicians in India have been repeating, without giving any legitimate source for the information. The two ‘technical heads’ they have ‘interviewed’ are kept anonymous to ‘protect their identity’ as they head ‘vital technical teams at DA’. So what makes people associated with Congress and Aam Aadmi Party sharing links from a dubious website which have no credible source to back the claims? The Congress party and its allies have been going hammer and tongs against the Modi led government alleging a scam  in the purchase of Dassault Rafale jets despite several experts explaining  threadbare why no scam exists.  The Rafale chief, Eric Trappier himself had debunked Congress’  conspiracy theories and the Ministry of Defence too had issued statements . Rahul Gandhi had even alleged on the floor of the house during the no-confidence motion against the Modi government that in his private meeting with the French President, Macron had disagreed with the Modi government’s claims. However, even before the parliament session got over, the French government released a statement  refuting Rahul Gandhi’s claims. Later, proof surfaced showing that the Congress government had itself signed  the confidentiality agreement. Even Anil Ambani had written a letter  explaining the deal to Rahul Gandhi so he would stop with the insipidity. But to no avail. Congress President Rahul Gandhi, taking his desperation to belittle the Modi government to a whole new level, tried and encashed on the French President Francois Hollande’s statement  which was later rubbished  by both the French government and Dassault. Earlier we had shown how a website by the name ‘viralinIndia’, run by Congress supporter Abhishek Mishra , was spreading pro-Islamist propaganda along with sleazy and rubbish posts like a hen giving birth to puppies. Similar seems to be the modus operandi of IndiaScoops, where anti-government propaganda and fake news could be peddled along with the sleazy content of nude pictures to get the traffic. This again begs a bigger question: Deep inside, are these politicians and “journalists” just rumour mongering trolls?",2018-09-25,"anil ambani,congress party,Congress scam,Dassault Aviation,divya spandana,fake,fake news,HAL,hindustan aeronautics ltd,IndiaScoops,modi government,prashant bhushan,Rafale,rafale deal,rahul gandhi,reliance defence","Divya Spandana, Prashant Bhushan share ‘news’ from dubious website ‘IndiaScoops’ to prove Rafale is a ‘scam’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/divya-spandana-prashant-bhushan-share-news-from-dubious-website-indiascoops-to-prove-rafale-is-a-scam/
512,OpIndia Staff,"The death of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, one of the greatest mysteries of modern Indian political history, has yet again gained some traction, as the Central Information Commission (CIC) on Monday stated that  all ‘classified papers’ relating to the former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s death should be placed before the Prime Minister and the Home Minister to take call on their declassification. According to the reports , the CIC issued these directives to the central public Information officers of the Prime Minister’s Office, External Affairs Ministry and Home Ministry after a plea by an RTI activist Navdeep Gupta sought information whether an autopsy was conducted on Shastri who had died on January 11, 1966. , the Union government had denied any information regarding the release of the classified documents citing them as prejudicial to the interests of the country. However, the Information Commissioner reportedly stated further that in view of the startling incidents that followed the mysterious death, such as the killing of his personal staff in two separate ‘accidents’, the vanishing of records of Rajya Sabha Committee’s probe, and several other points raised over the years journalists and Shastri’s family members, the Commission is of opinion that the Union government has a duty to explain to the nation why and how Lal Bahadur Shastri died in Tashkent.

513,Nirwa Mehta,"Last evening, Congress IT cell head, Divya Spandana and senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who was also one of the founding members of Aam Aadmi Party before Arvind Kejriwal fired him, along with others shared an article from ‘IndiaScoops.com’ which claimed to have spoken exclusively to ‘two technical heads’ at Dassault Aviation (DA) regarding the Rafale deal. Earlier, one of the articles claiming PM Modi spent Rs. 35 lakh on his ‘HumFitToIndiaFit’ challenge , was also shared widely by everyone. While we debunked the article already , we decided to dig a deeper into IndiaScoops.com. As we have previously said, the website was created on 27th April 2018, where the owner went to buy a premium account to mask his/her identity, the Facebook page associated with the website was an Arshi Khan, a Bigg Boss contestant, fan page. Many times websites diversify and take up topics like sports and entertainment in a bid to reach out to a wider audience. However, IndiaScoops, which usually writes on soft porn like which actress’ nudes pics were leaked and gossip like how is the show Bigg Boss doing, decided to diversify into ‘politics’, the articles which eventually get shared by AAP and Congress leaders, so-called journalists and lawyers. Here is a look at the kind of articles that get regularly featured on IndiaScoops.com. Recently popular posts as of today were these: One Aneesha Singh Sharma had ‘claimed’ she was having an affair with Flynn Remedios (the one who runs this Arshi Khan fan page/investigative journalism website), but later apologised after she was ‘sued’. She also gets conned by one ‘rogue filmmaker’ who leaked her bikini pics. She also accused Bigg Boss, 12 participants, Anup Jalota of cheating. Who is Aneesha Singh Sharma? And who is this ‘rogue filmmaker’? My guess is as good as your guess. Some more posts from IndiaScoops.com Flynn Remedios, who otherwise has access to top technical heads at Dassault Aviation and PMO, works as publicist of Bigg Boss contestants on the side. But this is where it gets weird. There are four stories, where models/actresses have accused one Rameshnath Venkat Rao, a Hyderabad based director of ‘leaking’ nude images. It is shocking that despite so much evidence against Rameshnath Venkat Rao, we could hardly find anything against him anywhere. Neither does he have an IMDb profile nor is he on Wikipedia. Does Rao even exist? Or is he created to share ‘leaked’ soft porn images by this website? A search by his name on the website reveals more sleazy pictures under the garb of ‘leaked images by a director’. I think as someone from the industry, Congress IT cell head Divya Spandana, should take a stand and ask for the arrest of Rameshnath Venkat Rao so that proper investigation on the allegations could be carried out. Amidst the soft porn peddled by this website, there have been at least two articles from this which have gone viral and shared widely by Congress and Aam Aadmi Party leaders as well as many ‘journalists’ and ‘senior lawyers’.

514,OpIndia Staff,"CBI is likely to intensify its investigation in Assam in the high-profile Louis-Berger scam. A team of the agency is likely  to visit the state next week and conduct further investigations. Louis-Berger is a US-based construction management firm which had revealed that they had paid bribes to government officials in Goa and Assam to get contracts. The case  goes back to 2015 when top executives of the company pleaded guilty of paying bribes of millions of Dollars worldwide in a federal court. The bribes were paid to win contracts and to avoid prosecution in accounting frauds including overbilling in various counties. The list of corruption included bribes paid to win water projects in Goa and Assam. According to information released by US department of justice, by A total of $976,630 paid in the two states, which included payments to a minister in Goa government and officials of respective departments in both Goa and Assam in the year 2010. The names of the minister and officials were not revealed by US officials. The bribes were paid to get water projects in both the states. When the contracts were allotted to the company, both states were ruled by Congress governments. In Assam, the company worked on a water supply project in Guwahati which is being executed by Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which comes under Guwahati Development ministry of Assam government. Although the US court reports say that only some officials received bribes in Assam, it did not stop trading accusation by Congress and BJP. Former CM Traun Gogoi has alleged that BJP leader and minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is involved in the scam, as he was Guwahati Development Minister in the Gogoi government when Sarma was in Congress. On the other hand, Sarma says that he was the minister of the department only for a short period and the department was under the Chief Minister for the rest of the time. After the revelations in the US, investigations started in the two states to find out who got the alleged bribes.

515,Shashank Goyal,"India has estimated  280 million cows but killing them for meat is legal in only 8 out of 29 states. Meanwhile, neighbouring Bangladesh where beef is in high demand suffers from a severe shortage of cattle. According to the data from the Department of Livestock Services (DLS ), Bangladesh requires 71 lakh tonnes of meat annually but can only produce 62 lakh tonnes.  Bangladesh’s slaughterhouses just cannot source sufficient cows from within the country. Due to such high demand, cows from India fetch 5 to 10 times  their price in Bangladesh. A cow that costs Rs 5,000 in India easily fetches up to Rs 50,000 in Bangladesh. This has given rise to a highly profitable cattle smuggling business across India-Bangladesh border. An estimated  1.5 million to  According to The Sunday Guardian, an estimated smuggled cattle are into  out of India estimated  Bangladesh, “every day”, which indicates the enormous scale of the trafficking. In monetary terms, this illegal cross-border trade is  Many instances of cow smuggling across the border have been caught on camera and some such here can be watched here , here , here.  and India Today  Short video reports on this issue are also published by German media DW  and  Millions of cows slaughtered in Bangladesh actually originate from India. Most  of these cows are sourced by stealing  them from some poor farmers  of Indian villages  in Rajasthan, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab or Odisha – whose livelihood depends upon these cattle. Many instances of cattle being stolen are caught on CCTV cameras and some such videos can be watched here , here  and here Another market for such stolen cattle is illegal slaughterhouses within India. These are  Cows stolen from across the country are sold to these slaughterhouses  at a premium  who then sell their meat to make money. There are approximately 30,000  such illegal slaughterhouses across India. As per a Hindustan Times  report, in just 7 years period between 2009 to 2016, Rajasthan police registered over  Hordes and hordes of cattle are stolen from poor farmers across the country every day, filled brutally in trucks, transported across the country to border areas in Assam and West Bengal and then smuggled to Bangladesh. Many cattle die  during the transport itself and many die while being smuggled across the fence. Like any other multi-billion dollars but illegal business, cattle smuggling is an organized crime syndicate, comprising of thousands of criminals who are armed , vicious and deadly . Anyone who obstructs the business anywhere along its supply chain is likely to be attacked and murdered. While sourcing the cattle (stealing from poor farmers), if cattle owners try to stop the act, they are shot, stabbed or crushed under the vehicle and killed. Then, while transporting the stolen cattle from villages to border areas, if they are stopped by police, they are also shot  or rammed by trucks and killed . Finally, when crossing the border, if caught by India’s Border Security Force (BSF), then they are shot or crushed by vehicles too (Times of India , The Hindu , Business Standard , Indian Express ) The mobs of meat mafia are fearless and these criminals show no inhibitions in violently attacking law enforcement officers, media personnel or animal rights activists if they try to inspect illegal slaughterhouses or even report against them (India Today , Deccan Herald , Times of India , FirstPost ) Recently in UP, two temple priests reported  ongoing illegal slaughters in their neighbourhood. The smugglers tied them to a cot, chopped off their tongues and then slit their throats to send a message  to anyone who reports to police and this is a recurring  theme . Under these circumstances, farmers in many villages across India have now formed groups to protect their cattle from theft. In order to protect themselves from armed gangs of smugglers, most such people act in organized groups called “gau-rakshaks” (protectors of cows). So, does this write-up intend to justify mob violence in the name of cow protection?  Violence in response to violence will lead the society into anarchy. Such actions have no place in a civilized society. PM Modi has himself denounced  it multiple times and, in many cases, “cow protectors” involved in mob violence have been sentenced to life  in prison. The intention of this write-up is to illustrate many dimensions of this issue that have not been fully analyzed or narrated at all. Indian mainstream media has mostly portrayed this as an issue linked to religion, which is not completely true. In most cases, “cow protectors” confront people either when they are caught stealing the cattle or when they are seen transporting them. “Cow protectors” do not look for “Muslims” and start attacking them. The religion of the victim is incidental, and not the trigger for the event. Also, in most cases, “cow-protectors” act as “police informers” and resort to handing the culprits to the police after catching them. But these do not get much media coverage. Cases of uncontrolled mob fury where victims are killed are few and far between – but these are the ones which get highlighted. This presents a skewed picture of the issue instead of a holistic perspective. Many elite Indian journalists in English language media have never stepped at any incident site or talked to people involved. Sitting in their ivory towers, they have simply passed the verdict that this is an “anti-Muslim” issue. Indian journalist Barkha Dutt published an article in Washington Post  on acts of violence by “Cow Terrorists” against Muslims. Atish Taseer painted Indian society negatively in NewYork times . Shekhar Gupta called India as Lynchistan . Another Indian journalist Sagarika Ghose has been maintaining a list of incidents on her Facebook  page where “Muslims” have been attacked by a mob due to cattle related issues. Number of lynching incidents in last 4 years according to Ms Sagarika’s list where the identity of victims was “Muslim” = 26 Unfortunately, nobody is maintaining any list of dead victims whose identities were – The above list, if created would contain  Meanwhile, when a victim named Rakbar Khan died in one such incident in Rajasthan, the only aspect that got highlighted in most media coverage was his religious identity. Some other aspects of the incident that didn’t get enough attention were that – In other words, he was most likely a repeat offender involved in cattle smuggling. Unfortunately, violence due to cattle related issues has been painted as a  Fencing and tighter vigil may bring down the scale of business but its lucrative potential may keep attracting cow smugglers. A better problem-solving approach is to address the root cause itself. As per this  India should explore flooding the Bangladesh market with low price Buffalo beef. Legal export of buffalo beef would make low price meat available in the local market which would kill the demand for expensive smuggled meat and eventually prevent cattle theft from Indian farmers. At the same time, generation of export revenue for India would be an added benefit considering that current illegal cow smuggling market is estimated at $1.5 billion annually.",2018-09-25,"Bangladesh,buffalo,Cattle mafia,Cattle slaughter,Cattle trade,Cow,India,Lynchings,Lynchistan,smuggling",The big-picture view of cattle related violence in India : It is more than what meets the eye,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/the-big-picture-view-of-cattle-related-violence-in-india-it-is-more-than-what-meets-the-eye/
516,K Bhattacharjee,"Over the past few months, the Rafale deal has transformed into a political slugfest. The wise men and women of the Congress party and their well-wishers in the media appear to have concluded that portraying the deal as a scam is essential to establish Congress President Rahul Gandhi as a serious politician. Recently, former President of France, Hollande, added fuel to the fire by claiming  that India proposed that Dassault partner with Reliance for the project. However, he later backtracked from his earlier statement and admitted that he was not aware of any such pressure on Dassault. Rahul Gandhi, however, was quick to latch on to Hollande’s allegations and tweeted that Prime Minister Modi himself had intervened to deliver billions of dollars to the Ambanis. There was only one problem with this fantastic story concocted by Rahul Gandhi. There doesn’t appear to be much truth to it. OpIndia.com has published a comprehensive fact-check  of the allegations on the Reliance-Rafale controversy. As it turns out, even during the UPA era pact, Dassault had did not want to  tie up with HAL and the deal was in limbo because of this point of contention. If one was under the impression that the allegations couldn’t get more ridiculous, then they are obviously unaware of antics of the Congress party. The Goa unit of the party has now claimed  that Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were not asking for the resignation of the ailing Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parikkar because “he has crucial information on the Rafale fighter jet deal which he could use to ‘blackmail’ them”. During the entire charade, the Congress party has scored  multiple self-goals. At one point, they ‘gheraoed ‘ the Prime Minister’s residence on a day when Narendra Modi wasn’t even in the country. The Congress is perhaps convinced of a scam in the Rafale deal because its own track record of defence deals is rather dubious, so to speak. The Bofors scam, the controversy surrounding Augusta Westland is quite well known. One such deal that is not very well known is the ordered a probe . In 2016, reports had emerged which claimed that the government had reported  into the Pilatus deal and in July 2017 and it was  It is pertinent to mention here that Bhandari, purportedly has links  to Robert Vadra, husband of Priyanka Gandhi, and Dassault refused to partner with Offsets India Solutions (OIS), whose promoter is Bhandari after they discovered his proximity to Vadra. Confidential documents were recovered by the Income Tax Department during raids on his offices which were part of an investigation in a tax evasion case against Bhandari and his company. Email exchanges between Vadra and Bhandari were also discovered. In January this year, Sanjay Bhandari was declared a ‘proclaimed offender’ by a Delhi court under the Official Secrets Act, due to failure to attend before the court. The defence ministry has since suspended all dealings with OIS. The Pilatus deal has shrouded in controversy from the time it materialized. Korea Aerospace Industries, its closest rival, had strongly protested  the deal claiming that Pilatus had submitted an incomplete bid and demanded its disqualification. South Korea’s defence minister personally contacted A.K. Antony, his Indian counterpart, requesting a “high-level review”. However, these objections were overruled and Pilatus was awarded the contract. In 2015, after Finance wing of the Ministry of Defense flagged the Pilatus deal, the Indian Express reported , “…nine components, now part of an IAF proposal to pay Pilatus under the maintenance head were not calculated during the request for proposal (RFP) stage before declaring it the lowest bidder.” This is the very same issue the Koreans had raised in 2011. It should be noted that Bhandari is under CBI investigation  for alleged malpractices in the selection of the Swiss aircraft, Pilatus PC-7″. One wonders if the high decibel attack on the NDA government’s Rafale deal by the Congress Party is motivated by a need to deflect attention from the skeletons in their own closet. An investigation that was initiated in 2016. It could very well be that the allegations against Rafale have surfaced as a consequence of the NDA government ordering probes into shady arms deals made by the UPA government.

The newly elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, is mighty displeased with the decision. He took to Twitter to say, “all my life I have come across small men occupying big offices who do not have the vision to see the larger picture.” Indians were amused with the haughty statement issued by Imran Khan who is widely believed to have been elected Prime Minister with assistance from the Pakistani Military and took potshots at the former cricketer. Others called on Prime Minister Modi to revoke Pakistan’s MFN status in light of the insulting tweet. People are concluding after Imran Khan’s tweet that the relationship between the two countries is likely to go further downhill from here.

518,OpIndia Staff,"BJP MP and eminent legal activist Subramanian Swamy has levelled serious allegations on Sonia Gandhi and P Chidambaram. Swamy has alleged that Sonia Gandhi and P Chidambaram had conspired to help LTTE chief Prabhakaran when Mahinda Rajapaksa led Sri Lankan government was exterminating LTTE. In a Tweet shared on September 20, Subramanian Swamy has alleged that TDK (a term Swamy uses for Sonia Gandhi) had sent a message (through P Chidambaram) to LTTE chief Prabhakaran that the Indian Navy would come and rescue him. According to a report  in the Daily Pioneer, Swamy has also stated that the India Navy ship which was due to reach Sri Lanka could not leave Indian waters because of stiff opposition from highest authorities. Since the war against LTTE was at its final stage, Prabhakaran could not be notified about the change of plans and was eventually killed. Swamy’s statement has come at the wake of the recent visit of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was on a visit to India last week. It is notable here that Subramanian Swamy has been a great supporter of the former Sri Lankan President and vocally praises his decisive war against the LTTE in 2009 which resulted in the total extermination of the terrorist group from Sri Lanka. In 2012 too, during a visit to the island nation, Swamy had reportedly stated  that Rajapaksa is a resolute and determined leader and he deserves to be awarded India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna for eliminating LTTE. During the visit, Swamy had also stated  that Sonia Gandhi and her ‘Italian family’ had provided covert support to LTTE.

520,OpIndia Staff,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today told the news agency ANI that irrespective of the allegations, Rafale deal will fall through and it will not be cancelled. In this interview, Jaitley says, some statements are given with an intention to create controversy. But some statements are such that situation and circumstances prove them wrong and such statements have no credibility. “French government has said that our former president is not giving a true statement. Dassault had decided who would be the offset manufacturing partner. Dassault said they decided the partners and Indian government has nothing to do with our decision. Their own government and their own company has refuted the claims of former president,” Jaitley said. Elaborating on the why this speculations could have risen, Jaitley said, “Everyone knows Reliance split into two. One Reliance (led by Mukesh Ambani) was that which in 2012, when there was a possibility of a contract of 126 aircrafts, signed a contract for Rafale with the same Dassault. Was that also corruption? Were Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi favouring Reliance? Secondly, that Reliance (after split) did not get into defence equipment, the other Reliance (led by Anil Ambani) did. So it is natural that if in 2014 a new deal is signed, all defence manufacturing companies involved in offset manufacturing bid for the same. So if a private Indian company gets into this offset manufacturing contract, what is the problem? Indian government has not put forward anyone’s name. Dassault has also asserted that all the companies in the contract are chosen by them.” On former French President Hollande’s claims, he said, “On first day, Hollande said that the French government had no role to play, the name (selecting Reliance as offset manufacturing partner) came from India. If it is true, it is a serious accusation. Second day, in Montreal, AFP asked him were you aware that the recommendation of Reliance came from Indian government. To that Hollande responded by saying he is not aware and directed to question Dassault. Then he said ‘the partners chose themselves’. So what is he even trying to say? It is notable that he issued his first statement in the background of allegations of conflict of interest being by the media in France. So he said it while defending himself. So in light of all this, should we halt the preparedness of the armed forces?” On Rahul Gandhi’s allegations that the ‘chowkidar of India is a chor’, Jaitley said, “Public discourse is not a laughter challenge. One day you go and hug someone, then you wink at someone, then you keep issuing wrong statements. In a democracy, there are allegations and counter allegations. But your words should also make sense. Bringing down the public discourse does not suit the world’s largest democracy.” On 31th August, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted, “This  Hollande’s statement came just few days after the above tweet. Jaitley questioned how did Rahul Gandhi know that there is trouble brewing in France? One day Hollande makes a statement, next day he retreats, but Rahul Gandhi predicts it 20 days in advance. This raises questions. Yesterday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had held a press conference and even tweeted that Rafale is a Rs. 1,30,000 crore scam. “What is the scam? Indian Air Force will get 36 jets which have weaponised capacity,” said Jaitley. Recounting the Kargil War, he said, “During Kargil War, when enemy was on the mountain, and we were using Bofors 155 mm guns on them, it took us 3 months to bring down 500-600 Pakistani soldiers. If we had Rafale which could hit the target from a distance of 100-150 kms away, then it would have been a two day operation. Hence, it is not a scam but a requirement of the Indian Air Force and the money we are investing will strengthen Indian Air Force. These are the aircraft which China already has and Pakistan has started manufacturing. And the same aircraft which on which Congress sat for 10 years and delayed procurement. Concluding the interview, he said, “The Rafale deal is a government to government deal and is very important for the country. These jets are coming to India… They are required for Indian defence. They will enhance the combat ability of the Indian Air Force.”",2018-09-23,"air force,Arun Jaitley,defence,defence deals,Defence forces,indian air force,Narendra Modi,PM Narendra Modi,rafael deal,Rafale,Rafale jets,rahul gandhi,UPA,UPA government",Watch: Rafale deal to not be cancelled: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ANI,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/watch-rafale-deal-to-not-be-cancelled-finance-minister-arun-jaitley-to-ani/

522,OpIndia Staff,"Yesterday, a Twitter user by the handle, @WrongDoc , in a series of tweets  raised questions over former Congress President Sonia Gandhi’s Russia visits. He cites an April 2018 article  which talks about Sonia Gandhi inaugurating Indira exhibition in Moscow, where she did not interact with political figures of Russia since it was her private visit. As per the report, The organisers of the exhibition were the Federal Archival Agency, the State Archives of the Russian Federation, the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust and the Embassy of Russia in India. On visiting Russian Federal State Archives website , one can find how one of the organisers of the exhibition was Congress’ Siddaramaiah-led Government of Karnataka. One wonders whether the Congress-led state government was used as a cover for Sonia’s visit to Moscow. Right now, when the Indian political discourse is heated up due to the recent Rafale controversy , Sonia Gandhi is again in Russia  to participate in Eurasian Women’s Forum, organised by the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Here, Sonia Gandhi was debating on ‘The Positive Energy of Young People’. There are no other details available on the rest of her schedule in Russia. Sonia Gandhi, owing to her health, seldom travels abroad, but has been to Russia twice in six month period with a visit to an undisclosed location (presumed the US) in May for her health check-up. So, as @WrongDoc says , in April, Siddaramaiah helps arrange Sonia Gandhi’s visit to Moscow, loses elections and has to step aside to let Kumaraswamy become chief minister and in between, the mother-son duo, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, mysteriously go away in the middle of political turmoil in Karnataka to an undisclosed location, thereby delaying formation of Karnataka government. Sonia Gandhi’s mysterious visits to Russia are not new. In 2005, Sonia took  a Reliance jet to fly to Moscow. She was a private guest of President Putin, when she was neither the Prime Minister nor President of India, only the President of the ruling political party, Congress. The official information of foreign trips by Sonia and Rahul under the UPA is, interestingly, not available . A Wikileaks cable  from the time speculates that ‘she might use the trip to dig up information on UP Chief Minister Yadav’s 1997 Sukhoi deal and also to ease relations between the Congress and its Communist allies.’ Sonia Gandhi never held any official position in the ministry. These surprise visits to Russia are not new for the Gandhi family. Back in 1985, Rajiv Gandhi made  a surprise visit to Moscow to discuss a Kremlin arms control proposal with then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. A now-declassified December 1985 CIA report  said that the Soviets pumped in huge amount of cash to influence Indian politicians, including a large number of Congress MPs during Prime Minister Indira Gandhis government, to influence Indian policies. This even continued in Rajiv Gandhi government. “As many as 40 per cent Congress MPs in (Indira) Gandhi’s last government had received Soviet political contributions,” the report had said. A Telegraph report  states that a book, co-authored by Christopher Andrew, professor of contemporary history with KGB defector ‘The Mitrokhin Archive Volume II’, states 10 Indian newspapers were on KGB payroll. KGB was the main security agency for the Soviet Union till the dissolution of Soviet state. The book reportedly says how India in the 1970s was one of the countries most successfully penetrated by Soviet intelligence. The book alleges that the Congress coffers during Indira Gandhi’s regime was filled by KGB and the principal fundraiser, Lalit Narayan Mishra knew he was accepting Soviet money.",2018-09-23,"Congress,Congress ecosystem,congress leaders,Indira Gandhi,intelligence,Rafale,rahul gandhi,rajiv gandhi,Russia,Siddaramaiah,sonia gandhi,Vladamir Putin",This ‘theory’ about Sonia Gandhi’s Russia visits and Rafale ‘controversy’ is catching attention on Twitter,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/this-theory-about-sonia-gandhis-russia-visits-and-rafale-controversy-is-catching-attention-on-twitter/

Rajesh Sarkar, a former student of the school, succumbed to bullet injuries and was declared dead on arrival at the Islampur hospital. Later, Taposh Barman, a student of class 11, who was in a critical condition succumbed to his injuries at the North Bengal Medical College. Another student Saurav Barman is undergoing treatment at the Islampur Hospital for bullet injury on his leg. Students and former students of the high school were protesting against the appointment of three new Urdu teachers in the school, as they were demanding Bengali medium teachers of other subjects like science and mathematics. When the three new teachers came to the school to join their jobs, students blocked  their entry. Soon former students and people from the locality also joined the students. According to some reports , there are no Urdu students at the school at present. Some reports mention that a Sanskrit teacher was also among them. When the teachers were blocked from entering the school by protesters, local Police had to intervene as the students had blocked the road in front of the school, The police resorted to lathicharge, tear gas shells and rubber bullets after they were reportedly attacked by the students.

Earlier, controversy had erupted when the circular was brought out by the UGC with the opposition accusing the government of trying to ‘politicize the army’. The UGC had released a circular to higher education institutions to hold programmes and activities to celebrate  “Surgical Strike Day”. It had suggested organising special parades, written pledges of support for the armed forces and meetings with ex-servicemen. The West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee had said  that the state will not celebrate the ‘Surgical Strike Day’. He accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre of trying to “malign and politicise” the Army. “This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using the UGC ahead of elections. It is a matter of shame that they are using the UGC to achieve their political agenda,” Chatterjee said. He further added that they have full respect for the soldier and their sacrifices and said that they would have understood and celebrated it if the UGC had asked to observe the day as a respect for sacrifices made by the soldiers. According to Chatterjee, the Indian Army has always been kept above politics and controversies and the party won’t support anything which maligns the Army. While the HRD ministry clarified  that the above circular is not mandatory, the Opposition was quick to take it as an opportunity to attack the government. Kapil Sibal, a senior Congress party leader has also questioned  the idea of celebrating Surgical Strike Day and called it as “another jumla”. “Is this meant to educate or to serve BJP’s political ends?” Kapil Sibal said in a tweet today. He accused the centre of interfering in the functioning of the UGC by issuing such circulars. However, Union HRD Minister has cleared that the government has not made any compulsions on any institutions or students.

529,K Bhattacharjee,"The Congress party has suffered  a critical blow ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. BSP supremo Mayawati has announced a coalition with ex-Chief Minister of Chhatisgarh and Congress rebel Ajit Jogi for the elections in Chhattisgarh. Prospects for the party look bleak for the 2019 General elections as well now as the Mahagathbandhan appears to be crumbling. Mayawati’s inclusion in the grand alliance was essential to combat the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Without BSP in the fold, it could very well turn out to be a sweep in Uttar Pradesh next year. Meanwhile, the Congress party sees BJP hands behind Mayawati’s decision. State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel said , “Pressure from the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate on the BSP has led to the creation of this alliance. This alliance had been formed with the BJP’s support and the people of the state had an understanding of it.” He went on to say that the alliance was formed with the BJP’s support. The BJP is visibly pleased with the formation of the alliance. “Hopes of the Congress were dashed as it had been trying for an alliance with the BSP. The political scenario emerging after the alliance between the BSP and the JCC reflects that the state will see a triangular fight in the coming election,” state BJP president Dharamlal Kaushik said . It could very well be that Mayawati is bargaining hard for a greater share of seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. And if a respectable number of seats are offered to her, she may yet ally with the Congress-led Mahagathbandhan in the all-important elections. It is important to note that Mayawati had made it clear  that an alliance for the General elections will be considered only if a seat-sharing arrangement is reached for the elections in the three states that go to polls this year. Clearly, the Congress will now be grasping at straws to bring Mayawati into its fold. As an immediate effect, Chhattisgarh appears to be a lost cause for the Congress party. In Madhya Pradesh, which was always going to be difficult, reports  suggest that the Congress is suffering from infighting in its ranks as a consequence of which it could suffer. Rajasthan appears to be much easier ground for Rajasthan as it has some popular leaders on the ground and reports suggest that BJP is suffering from anti-incumbency due to Vasundhara Raje’s unpopularity. The Congress party understands very well that it will be clobbered by the BJP in 2019 if the Mahagathbandhan fails to materialize. Its supposed allies aren’t comfortable with Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate for the grand alliance and its problems are exacerbated by the fact that there are multiple contradictions within the alliance itself. The BJP, however, will know better than take it for certain that Mayawati will not be a part of the Mahagathbandhan in 2019. The Congress is still a cunning opposition and while Rahul Gandhi may be a little deficient on political acumen, Sonia Gandhi is not. Therefore, the Congress might yet succeed in coming up with offers that Mayawati cannot refuse.

530,OpIndia Staff,"Former French President Hollande’s alleged revelation regarding the Modi government suggesting Reliance’s name for partnering in the Rafale deal has initiated yet another round of political slugfest. After the revelations by a French journalist, Rahul Gandhi latched on to the news and tweeted that the PM personally negotiated and change the Rafale deal behind closed doors. He alleged that PM Modi delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to a bankrupt Anil Ambani. Essentially, Rahul Gandhi, piggybacking on Hollande’s alleged assertions, said that the PM had indulged in crony capitalism by mediating and awarding the deal to Reliance. However, the truth might be different. In 2012 under the Congress-led UPA government, Reliance Industries and France’s Dassault Aviation had signed a pact  for partnering in the defence and homeland security sector. Mukesh Ambani’s RIL had formed a new company named Reliance Aerospace Technologies Ltd (RATL) for this purpose. This was during the first round of bidding for 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) that India was seeking to buy, which was eventually cancelled. The MOU was inked 2 weeks after  Dassault’s Rafale emerged as the preferred bidder in a $15 billion contest to supply 126 multi-role fighter planes to India under the Congress regime. It was a necessity as a mandatory offset clause was prescribed by the Indian government. In 2013, news  emerged that France’s Dassault Aviation and Reliance Industries are planning to set up a facility to produce wings of Rafale combat aircraft selected by IAF for meeting its requirement of 126 fighter planes. It was reported that a  It was reported  that under the agreement, Dassault would help Reliance set up a facility that was similar to Dassault’s facility in France. The clincher, however, is that the media reported in 2013 that the Defence Ministry and other agencies concerned have given a go-ahead to the two companies for creating the unit. A 2013 report in NDTV quotes : Although Dassault agreed that HAL will build the planes in India, they kept a significant condition for that. As per the agreement, Dassault was to supply 18 fighters from their plants in France and rest 108 planes were to be manufactured by HAL. And Dassault flatly refused to take any responsibility for the planes made by HAL. Dassault had serious reservations  about the ability of HAL to accommodate  the complex manufacturing and technology transfers of the aircraft. Dassault wanted that two separate contracts should be signed for the two batches of fighters, but the Indian government said at that stage the terms of the contract can’t be altered. It also wanted Dassault to take 100% responsibility of planes made by HAL. Both sides didn’t budge from its position and the deal remained stalled till the end of UPA government. During this period, the agreement between Dassault and Reliance was allowed to lapse as there was no clarity about the future of the deal. With this, RATL decided not to go ahead with defence business. The NDA government officially withdrew the MMRCA tender in July 2015. The original MMRCA deal didn’t go through even after finalisation of the deal because Dassault had such low confidence on HAL that they prefered to lose a multi-billion deal instead of depending on HAL.

531,OpIndia Staff,"A fresh political slugfest had ensued in India after a statement from the former French president Francois Hollande that the Indian government had manipulated the Rafale deal to benefit Anil Ambani. Yesterday, an article in a French website Mediapart had quoted Hollande  as saying that the government of India had proposed that the Anil Ambani owned Reliance Defence should be the service provider to Dassault in the mega-deal. Following the controversy, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had taken a step forward and alleged  that it was PM Modi himself who had personally negotiated and changed the deal behind closed doors so that the ‘bankrupt’ Anil Ambani can earn billions of dollars. The Indian ministry of defence then had released a statement that the report that claims Hollande’s statement regarding the deal is being verified and insisted that neither the Indian or French governments had any parts to play in the commercial agreement between Dassault and Reliance Defence. As the controversy began escalating in both French and Indian media, the government of France released a statement  saying that the deal signed on 23 December 2016 between the French and Indian governments for 36 Rafale aircraft is concerned solely with ensuring the delivery and quality of the aircraft. It further clarified that the French government had no role to play in the choice of Indian industrial partners and French companies have the full freedom to choose the Indian company they want to partner with. Following the statement by the French government, Dassault Aviation had also released a statement  regarding the allegations. The statement asserts that the Rafale deal was a government to government contract and it provided for compensation investments in India (offsets) worth 50% of the purchase value. It further explained that the partnership with Reliance Group was Dassault’s choice. It further included that Dassault has also signed partnerships with other companies such as Mahindra, SAMTEL, Maini, BTSL, DEFSYS, Kinetic etc and is presently involved in negotiations with a hundred other companies. Finally, it added that Dassault Aviation is very proud that India has chosen the Rafale fighter jets. The Rafale deal is constantly being targeted as a political punching bag for opposition parties . Despite the government of India issuing several clarifications and the Defence Minister herself stating on record that no foul play has taken place  during the deal, the issue just refuses to die down. The supreme court of India has accepted a petition over the scam allegations in the deal. Earlier, the government had stated that the details of the fighter aircraft and their specifications including pricing and other factors are a part of a confidentiality agreement and cannot be made public for the secrecy clause  in the deal.

532,OpIndia Staff,"The Rafale deal  has been turned into the Loch Ness monster by the opposition. They have time and again  hurled allegations  of a “scam ” in the inter-governmental Rafale deal between the Indian government and the French government to buy 36 Rafale jets made by Dassault Aviation. Unfortunately for the Congress party, their allegations have failed to stick. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi, during the no-confidence motion in the parliament against the Modi government had alleged that he had personally spoken to French President Macron  and he had told Gandhi that the Indian government was free to divulge details and the deal was not covered under the confidentiality clause. This claim too was promptly refuted  by the French government. On 21st September 2018, an interview of the former President Hollande surfaced in the French media where Hollande has allegedly claimed that the French government did not have any option but to go with Anil Ambani led Reliance as the service provider for Dassault  in the mega Rafale deal. We reported how the French government and Dassault Aviation had refuted Hollande’s claims  and asserted that the choice of partnering with Reliance was independently made by Dassault and the Indian government or the French government had no role to play. Piggybacking on the discussion surrounding Hollande’s claims and the French government’s counterclaims, NDTV journalist Noopur Tiwari floated a wild conspiracy theory that revealed her lack of comprehension skills. She claimed that while she was covering Prime Minister Modi’s Paris visit in 2015, where the “infamous” Rafale deal was announced, she noticed that in the list issued on the same day by the French government, the Ambani’s and Adani’s names were on top of the list. She insinuated, that since the Indian government’s list did not have the names on the top, the Indian government had perhaps hidden the fact that they were present. Her lack of comprehension skills and zealousness to insinuate wrongdoing on the part of the government was soon called out by vigilant political observers on Social Media. Deepak Singh who goes by the Twitter handle @smarket, pointed out that the French list was in alphabetical order while the Indian list was not. Hence, in the French list, the names of Ambani and Adani were on the top and in the Indian list, their names were not on top. If one notices carefully, it is indeed true that the French list was in alphabetical order. This fact was missed, either deliberately or otherwise by the NDTV journalist who proceeded to insinuate wrongdoing on the part of the Indian government.  against the Modi government and in favour of Congress is no secret.

533,OpIndia Staff,"As the debate into the Rafale deal further heats with former French president claiming that Indian government proposed Reliance as offset partner, which both current French government and Dassault Aviation have denied now, there is a need to revisit some details about India’s effort to buy Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) since the beginning. We have already reported  that during the first round of bidding for MMRCA, Dassault had chosen Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Industries are their offset partner and refused to take responsibility for planes made by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which ultimately led to the cancellation of the deal. Although Reliance had signed a MoU with Dassault, reliance lost interest in defence and aviation business after some time, and they allowed the MoU lapse in 2014. At that time there was no clarity about the future of the deal as both Dassault and GOI were adamant on their position about HAL. When the MoU lapsed, company called Offsets India Solutions (OIS) approached Dassault for a possible tie-up. At that time OIS used to be present at all international events in the defence offset sector. An Economic Times report  states that “There was considerable pressure to tie up for a partnership. Proposals were made several times and through several people.” OIS promoter was Sanjay Bhandari, who was allegedly linked with Robert Vadra, Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law. As reported by Economic Times, Few rounds of talks had taken place between the two companies. But when Dassault came to know about Bhandari’s links with Vadra, they decided against partnering with his firm. Reportedly, the Vadra link was one of the main reasons Dassault refused the deal. Bhandari was under investigation since 2010 in the charges of wrongly influencing defence deals. In May 2016, his offices were raided by Income Tax Department as part of an investigation in a tax evasion case against Bhandari and his company. During the raids, confidential defence ministry documents were found in his possession, which included documents related to India’s proposal to buy mid-air refuellers. The documents were allegedly related to defence purchases and proposals placed before the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC). There were also allegedly copies of minutes of the Contract Negotiation Committee meeting for purchasing refuellers. After this find, he was booked under the Official Secrets Act by Delhi Police. After that Bhandari managed to escape to London before he could be questioned further. In the documents recovered during these raids, agencies had found some email exchanges between Bhandari and Robert Vadra. According to a report , when ED had confronted Bhandari with the emails, he had acknowledged the email exchanges between him and Vadra. Emails and phone calls scrutinised by investigators also reveal that Bhandari was in regular contact with bureaucrats and politicians apart from private companies in the defence sector. Sources  reveal that Bhandari and Vadra were spotted together in social circles and arms expos in various part of the world. On further investigation by Enforcement Directorate, he was also booked under PMLA and in December last year, ED had seized assets worth ₹26.61 crore belonging to Bhandari. The property was seized in lieu of undisclosed assets held aboard by him. In January this year, Sanjay Bhandari was declared a ‘proclaimed offender’ by a Delhi court under the Official Secrets Act, due to failure to attend before the court. He is also under CBI investigation  for his links with to alleged malpractices in the selection of a Swiss aircraft, Pilatus PC-7.

534,OpIndia Staff,"A report submitted  by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in August 2018 has revealed that the former Uttar Pradesh Samajwadi party government, led by Akhilesh Yadav was unable to account for around ₹97,000 crores in government funds which were apparently spent by them when in power. The report criticises the former government for syphoning off the money in the name of various government schemes during its regime. According to the report, the Akhilesh government did not ever submit any documentary evidence to substantiate that the funds have been appropriately used. It furthered that out of the funds of ₹97,000, crores only ₹26,000 crores have been spent in Social Welfare, Education and Panchayat Department for which no utilisation certificate was provided either. The rest of the money also remained unaccounted, said the report. In the report  submitted in August 2018, it has been said that the previous government has not been able to deposit the ‘Utility Certificate’ of the amount. For this reason, the conjecture of misuse of such a large amount has emerged. It was said that from 2014 to 31st March 2017, the SP government has apparently spent crores on over 2.5 lac activities which remain unaccounted. The report specified  that whenever a particular budget is laid out for any department under a specific government scheme, the deadlines are also specified and every department is bound to submit a ‘utilisation report’ after the deadline concludes. It further stated that the onus also lies on the department sanctioning the budget as future budgeting would directly depend on how the previous money was utilised.

Singh was quoted saying, “corruption and its foundation were started by Mayawati in this state, Akhilesh Yadav has brought that tree, on the basis of the report, the government will investigate. I can say that the answer can be difficult for Akhilesh .” On the other hand, SP has described this issue as politically motivated. SP spokesperson Sunil Yadav said that the CAG report does not prove any point. It is just an estimate, said the Samajwadi party spokesperson, dismissing the report. Samajwadi party supremo Akhilesh Yadav  had left the media buzzing for quite sometime when the ‘Samajwad’ left his government accommodation in ruins  after he was asked to vacate it on Supreme Court’s orders.

The BJP released documents related to the ‘hawala link’ investigation and involvement of the Congress in money laundering after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a case  against Karnataka Congress strongman D K Shivakumar. Speaking to the media, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra released documents of various witnesses which alleges that hawala money transportation took place from Chandni Chowk to the Congress headquarters at Akbar Road in New Delhi. The BJP accused Congress President Rahul Gandhi of his involvement in the money laundering and said that the documents show that money trail from the state went to the Congress’ headquarters at Akbar Road. The documents  listed by Patra contains statements of H Anjaneya, assistant liaison officer of Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi, who has allegedly revealed that he used to carry money to the AICC headquarters which was brought by N Rajendra, caretaker of the Karnataka Bhavan. “I agree that, with Jagadish Chand, I carried cash to AICC office on Akbar Road. But money was brought by one Rajendran. I just accompanied Rajendran to the AICC office. But I never went to Chandni Chowk with Chand,” said H Anjaneya. Interestingly, Jagadish Chand, a resident of Delhi was the driver of the late Suresh Kumar Sharma, proprietor of Bengaluru-based Sharma Travels, who was a very close aide of D K Shivakumar.

540,Editorial Desk,"Congress leaders can’t seem to be able to make up their minds on what stand they would like to take on Pakistan. On one hand, we have Congress leader and a minister in Punjab cabinet Navjot Singh Sidhu who visits Pakistan on their newly elected chief minister Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony and hugs the Pakistani Army chief  and on the other hand, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala is questioning PM Modi for not avenging killing of the soldiers on the border. Congress has often used the armed forces as per their convenience to make political points. For example, during the 2016 surgical strike, Congress had accused PM Modi of indulging in ‘khoon ki dalali ‘ and using the death of the soldiers for political gains. They made such a statement because the government and the Armed forces had decided to announce the surgical strike as a tactical move. Congress was also the same party that had asked for proof of surgical strikes from the Armed Forces and the Indian government and has, on several occasions, criticised the government’s ‘muscular’ policy in Kashmir. Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha had once ‘liked’ a tweet  that called the Indian Army “Indian occupation forces” and Congress leader Sandeep Dixit had called  the Army Chief a “sadak ka gunda”. With such colourful comments, one wonders how Congress can purport to today care about our jawans who have been insulted time and again by the party. The truth is, perhaps, that Congress in its desperation to prove PM Modi wrong, has turned itself into a party that doesn’t mind desecrating India’s ‘non-negotiables ‘. Every country has a set of values that cannot be trampled upon. For India, one of those values is its respect for the men who fight and lay their lives down for the nation. Congress has repeatedly used these men for their petty politics.

541,OpIndia Staff,"On 17th September 2018, a bizarre video had surfaced on social media which showed a BJP worker washing the feet of BJP MP  Nishikant Dubey and after that drinking that water. Nishikant Dubey, who is Lok Sabha MP from Godda constituency in Jharkhand, was attending an event to lay the foundation stone for a bridge on Tajia river between Kanbhari and Kalali village in Godda. During the ceremony, BJP worker from the area Pawan Shah washed Dubey’s feet with water and later drank a bit of the water used for the washing, to express his gratitude to the MP. Shah recalled how the villagers have been demanding the bridge for a long time, and they were grateful of Dubey for fulfilling his promise of building the bridge. When the video surfaced on media, it attracted immediate criticism from all. But both the concerned persons had defended the act. Pawan Shah had told media that what he did was his personal choice, and there should not be any hue and cry over it. Dubey also defended it saying it is part of Indian tradition, and he could not refuse the demand of his party worker. He said that Pawan is a veteran party worker and he had threatened to kill himself if he is not allowed to wash Dubey’s feet, remembering how the same Pawan Shah had cut is own thumb to put a tilak of blood on the forehead of Dubey after he won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He said, “I had two choices: a man washing my feet, or a man threatening to kill himself. Pawan is not a young worker. He has been an RSS/BJP worker since the 1990s.” Now, fed up with constant media coverage about the matter, Pawan Shah has sent a legal notice to several media personnel for their critical coverage of the incident. The notice sent through his advocate is addressed to Rohini Singh, Aroon Purie, Aveek Sarkar, Chief Editor of ANN, Rahul Joshi, Sudhir Chaudhary, Sudhir Agarwal and Chandan Sharma. The notice recounts that due the absence of proper roads and bridge over Tajia river, villagers were facing hardships. They had to travel an extra 7 km to cross the river, instead of the distance of 2 km. And during the 70 years of independence, no public representative took the matter seriously. During the 2014 election campaign when Dubey came to the village, he assured villagers that he will try to get the bridge built. Hearing this, Pawan Shah had publicly made a promise that on the day the foundation of the bridge is laid, he will wash the feet of Dubey and drink the water. So, when finally Dubey came to lay the foundation for the bridge on 16th September, Pawan reminded him about his promise. Although Dubey had vehemently refused to allow Pawan to do so, Pawan and other villagers demanded  that he must allow it. The legal notice mentions that Pawan threatened to harm himself with his own knife if he is not allowed to do this. At last Dubey had to concede and the act was recorded by some people, which was subsequently shown on various channels, after distorting the facts about the matter, the notice says. The notice also alleges that wrong reporting about the matter has caused mental harassment of Shah. It also says that everyday channels are calling him and using abusive words for him and they are trying to damage his image in society. The notice states that Shah washed the feet on his own and he was not forced by anyone to do it. He says that the Constitution gives him the independence to live his life the way he wants, there is no restriction on how he wants to express his feelings, how to greet guests. The act done during the foundation laying program does not violate any law and media is harassing him as if he has committed a grave crime. He also mentions that misinformation about him is being spread on social media sites like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc. Due to this, his mental status is being disturbed and his family is very worried. He is even thinking of committing suicide as it has become difficult for him to step out of the house. The notice than adds if any untoward incident happens to Shah, the people mentioned in the legal notice will be solely responsible for the same.

542,OpIndia Staff,"Continuing with use of social media for replying to allegations of opposition, union finance minister Arun Jaitley has posted another blog  of Facebook today. On 29th August, Jaitley had posted a blog  titled “15 Questions that Expose Congress Party’s Falsehood on Rafale”, where he answered opposition’s questions regarding the Rafale fighter deal and also had asked the Congress party 15 questions. Continuing after that, the finance minister has posted another blog titled “Falsehood of a ‘Clown Prince’”, launching a scathing attack on Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Jaitley writes that the strategy of Rahul Gandhi is to concoct a lie and repeat it as many times, as the party has become issueless and this provides him with some concocted material for his statements and speeches. He says that generally political career of people caught lying does not last long, but this does not apply to a dynastic organisation like Congress party. After the ‘Rafale concoctions’, the second lie from the Congress president is that PM Modi has waived off rupees two lakh fifty thousand of fifteen industrialists, writes Jaitley. The finance minister informs that all these amounts were lent to industrialists by banks before 2014 before Modi became PM. And, despite the industrialists defaulted on repaying the loans, those were kept rolling over by banks. The loans were ever-greened, means new loans were issued to cover repayment of earlier loans so that those loans do not show up as NPA in the books. The actual amount of NPA during UPA government rule was much more than what was reported, as a large amount of unpaid loan was concealed under the carpet. Jaitley informs that actual amount of NPA was found to be ₹8.96 lakh crores after a review of the books by Reserve Bank of India. opposed to ₹2.5 lakh crore as reported earlier. He also writes that no real steps were taken to recover the money. The reason the amount of NPA has increased after 2014-15 is not that more monies have been lent, but because of increasing interest on the overdue amount from the UPA era. He then informs about the steps the current government has adopted to resolve this problem. He says that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) that has been established by NDA government is the only effective method in this regard. This code has changed the debtor-creditor relationship in India. Now creditors can replace the management of the defaulting company and after that can invite bids for the takeover of the company. The creditors recover a significant portion of outstanding debts through such a takeover. Jaitley informs that RBI had identified 12 major defaulters in its first instalment of review. These 12 debtors owe around ₹3 lakh crores in principal interest and penal interest to various banks. The UPA regime took effort for the recovery of this debt. He writes that the UPA government allowed the banks to be looted, and the NDA government has enabled the banks to recover their loans through IBC. Adequate security was not provided for loans given, and UPA government was complicit in it, Jaitley alleges. And only now banks have started to make recoveries. The finance minister says that Rahul Gandhi can’t change the reality by repeating the same lie again and again. Jaitley then raises a question regarding Rahul Gandhi – ‘do people whose natural preference is falsehood deserve to be a part of the public discourse’. He says that public discourse is a serious activity and it is not a laughter challenge. He ends the blog by saying ‘It cannot be reduced to a hug, a wink or repetition of falsehood. The world’s largest democracy must seriously introspect whether public discourse should be allowed to be polluted by the falsehood of a ‘Clown Prince’.",2018-09-20,"Arun Jaitley,bank fraud,bank scam,Congress,Finance Minister,NPA,NPAs,Rafale,rafale deal,Rafale jet,Rafale jets,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi",‘Clown Prince’ is polluting public discourse with concocted falsehoods: Arun Jaitley,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/clown-prince-is-polluting-public-discourse-with-concocted-falsehoods-arun-jaitley/
543,OpIndia Staff,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been repeatedly telling  the world that the Modi government bypassed the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in favour of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence, insinuating kickbacks were received by the Modi government for the deal. Today morning Congress President took things one step further and tweeted a link where former HAL chief T S Raju claims that the Rafale jets could have been built in India. In the article  by Hindustan Times, T S Raju claims that while HAL may not have been able to build the jets at the desired cost, the company did have the ability to make fighter jets. While it is important to note what T S Raju said, it is also equally important what he has not said. Scientist and columnist Anand Ranganathan put out a thread  of tweets with articles busting the myth that state-owned HAL had the ability to make fighter jets. Back in 2015, NDTV had  reported that Dassault Aviation had raised concerns about the technical inadequacies of HAL. Dassault had flagged a concern that modernization of HAL’s technology could be a time-consuming process since they would need to upgrade the labs to meet the French standards. Another April 2015 Outlook article  speaks about one of the reasons the Rafale jets deal was being stalled. An April 2013 article  in India Today, from the time UPA 2 was in power, states how ‘HAL’s poor track record overshadowed IAF plans to buy the Rafale jets’. It is thus clear, that as far as Rafale is concerned, the capabilities of HAL have been in question since the Congress has been in power. One wonders then why Rahul Gandhi has been raising this issue over and over again. Is Rahul Gandhi unaware of what the situation was while his own government ruled, or ignoring facts and focussing on rhetoric serves a political agenda even if the Nation’s interests aren’t being served? While the facts are for all to see, this is not an attempt to put down HAL, which has made the country proud. Recently, Tejas LSP-8, a single-seat, single-jet engine, a multirole light fighter designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy, successfully completed  wet (actual) engagement by transferring 1,900 kg fuel from IAF IL78 mid-air refuelling tanker. With this, India joined the elite group of countries who have developed the Air-to-Air (AAR) system for a military class of aircraft. In August, India joined  the select club of US, Europe, Russia and China for having the capability of Deck Landing of fighter aircraft.",2018-09-20,"Anand Ranganathan,anil ambani,defence,defence deals,hindustan aeronautics ltd,Nirmala Sitharaman,Rafale,rafale deal,Rafale jets,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,reliance defence","Rafale deal: Even during the UPA era, Dassault did not want to partner with HAL",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/rafale-deal-even-during-the-upa-era-dassault-did-not-want-to-partner-with-hal/
544,Sanghamitra,"Rahul Gandhi has a great vision for India. If voted to power, he will make India the golden destination for manufacturing and trade. If the Congress comes to power, there will be no lack of employment. If the Congress comes to power, industrial progress, entrepreneurship and exports will be taken to new heights. If the Congress comes to power, the whole world will look towards India as a global manufacturing hub. Speaking at a rally in Rajasthan’s Dungarpur today, the Congress president made this promise to the locals: The ‘Made in Dungarpur’ mobile phones came just a couple of days after a similar promise was made in Bhopal. Rahul Gandhi has promised the people in Bhopal that all the mobile phones with ‘Made in China’ tag will soon be converted to ‘Made in Bhopal’ . While this time he was kind enough not to ask BHEL  to make mobile phones, Rahul Gandhi’s obsession with making cities of India the global manufacturing hub of mobile phones was listed out by one Twitter user. One also wonders if Rahul Gandhi is just laying the groundwork so he can later claim credit for increased manufacturing of cell phones if he comes to power. After all, the Prince will have to say something to substantiate his ‘achievements’. Not just mobile phones, as readers will very well remember, Rahul Gandhi wanted Mrs Obama  to use pans made in Jaunpur. He wanted Aligarh to be the global leader in making locks too, all of these will be possible when the Congress comes to power. But, wait, wasn’t Congress in power all these years? Surprisingly for a political leader who keeps hailing entrepreneurship and talks of boosting manufacturing abilities of the country, Rahul Gandhi was very much sceptical about the Make In India campaign launched by PM Modi in September 2014. He even mocked it in the parliament calling it a failure. Congress has remained in power in India for the major part of the country’s history after independence. Yet, Rahul Gandhi offers no explanation for why the cities he mentioned never became a manufacturing hub in all these years of Congress rule. On the contrary, the Make In India campaign that Rahul dismisses as a failure might be on track to taking all these political dreamings to fruition. Launched in 2014 by PM Modi, the campaign has been a major boost to the Indian manufacturing sector. When it comes to made in India mobile phones, global manufacturers  like Foxconn, ZTE, Oppo and Samsung have started their units in India. Recently, Samsung had launched in Noida what is supposed to be the world’s largest mobile phone manufacturing facility  with a capacity of shelling out 120 million mobile phones a year. Recently, it was revealed that ‘Made in India’ mobile phones have helped India save Rs 3 lakh crores  and has created 4 lakh 50 thousand jobs in the country. Rahul Gandhi conveniently ignores the fact that when his party was ruling India during the 60s and the 90s, India had registered a dismal 3% GDP growth rate,  mocked all over the world as the ‘Hindu rate of growth’, when other Asian countries like Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea dramatically increased their manufacturing capabilities and sprinted with a 7% growth. While Congress is repeating its old tirade of where are jobs, where is growth in every election rally, Make in India has brought global giants like Boeing, Saab, Alston, Lockheed Martin, Volvo and many more to India. So while Rahul Gandhi keeps making promises, Make in India is already delivering, playing a major part in taking India’s GDP growth rate  to be ranked among the world’s best.",2018-09-20,"Automobiles,China,Defense,gdp,growth rate,make in india,manufacturing sector,mobile,PM Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies","Jaunpur patilaa, Aligarh locks, Bhopal phones: While Rahul Gandhi talks, Make In India is delivering results",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/jaunpur-patilaa-aligarh-locks-bhopal-phones-while-rahul-gandhi-talks-make-in-india-is-delivering-results/

Suresh Reddy had joined  the TRS officially on 7th September this year in the presence of chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao. KT Rama Rao while addressing a meeting at Telangana Bhavan had welcomed senior Congress leader and former speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy along with his followers from Nizamabad district on joining TRS. Reddy’s decision to leave the Congress and join TRS had come as a shocker. Reddy had, however, said that he joined the party, not for any “political gains” but to be part of the “silent revolution” for the progress and development of Telangana State.

However, 3,247 of these were won by the BJP uncontested. The by-elections in most seats were necessitated due to either resignations or deaths of elected representatives. Opposition parties have alleged that they were not allowed to file nomination papers and have demanded that the poll process be deferred and rescheduled. State Secretary of CPI(M), Bijan Dhar, said , “First, our elected representatives were forced to resign. Then, when we tried to field our candidates, they (BJP) they did not allow us to submit nomination papers.” CPI(M) Central Committee member, Gautam Das, said , “The atmosphere is not conducive to holding free and fair panchayat elections in Tripura. Out of 35 blocks, non-BJP parties were not allowed to file nomination papers by ruling party supporters in 28 blocks.” State Election Commissioner, G Kameshwara Rao, rubbished the claims of violence made by opposition parties. He asserted that no violence was reported in offices where nomination papers were filed, thus, their demands for postponement cannot be considered. He said , “There is not a single complaint against the Block Development Officers, who act as returning officers for gram panchayat polls or against district magistrates who function as returning officers for the Zilla Parishad polls.” He also added that there was no complaint against the Police either. The BJP says that it won the seats uncontested because the opposition has no candidate to field. A spokesperson for the party, Mrinalkanti Deb, said , “Our people have won uncontested as the Opposition has no candidate to field. Their organisational base has shattered and the people have rejected them.” The allegations made by the opposition parties appear to be based on half-truths as there have been reports of mass defections to the BJP. In March, it was reported  that elected members of the Left Front in various local bodies had joined the BJP, which was a huge blow to the CPI(M) and its allies. In Kakrachera ADC village of Mungiakami block under Khowai subdivision, the Left Front had even turned minority as 4 of its members in the 7 member village committee defected to the BJP. There has been a series of defections  to the BJP since 2017 even before the party was elected to power in the state.

552,OpIndia Staff,"The ‘scam’ allegation over Rafale deal has now come full circle and is starting to bite the party that first claimed it. While Congress, especially its President Rahul Gandhi, has been claiming that a scam is involved in the deal between India and France to buy Rafale jets, the twin-engine Multi-Role Combat Aircraft from Dassault, now it is being rumoured that there was an ‘attempted scam’ over Rafale deal during the Congress era itself. This aspect came to light when columnist and scientist Anand Ranganathan asked a couple of questions to Defense Minister Nirmala Sitaraman over the Rafale deal. He asked: “There are some people who say that the Rafale deal did not go through during the UPA because there were some demands of kickbacks that were denied by Dassault. Do you think there is any strength to this rumour?” To this, Defence Minister N Sitharaman said: “You said it’s a rumour and I would like to see how far this rumour goes. One thing is there, during UPA, middlemen were the important actors for any procurement related matters, now there are no middlemen. So, with that said, we will wait and see”. In the short video that Anand posted, he also asked the Defense Minister if the government will probe these allegations of ‘kickback demands derailing Rafale deal’ during UPA era, to which Ms Sitraraman replied that first, she will have to see if the ‘rumours gain strength’. Ms Sitaraman though categorically rejected that there was an element of any scam in the Rafale deal executed by the Narendra Modi government. OpIndia asked Anand about these allegations of demands of kickbacks during the UPA era and if he thinks there could be an element of truth in it. “I want to know the truth myself, and this is why I asked the question,” Anand told OpIndia, “Yes, there have been rumours that the Rafale deal didn’t go through during the UPA era because there were some expectations of kickbacks that Dassault was not willing to pay. These could be plain malicious rumours, and that’s why I put the question to the defence minister.” Anand said that such rumours can’t be outrightly rejected because kickbacks in defence deals are not a new phenomenon. “Forget defence deals, in UPA era, you had kickbacks in almost everything. Walmart officially budgeted for lobbying , which can be argued to be as good kickbacks since lobbying is illegal in India, for their operations in this part of the region. We can also take the example of the Agusta Westland chopper scam where Christian Michel is accused of organising bribes in exchange for a 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters to be used by leaders including the President, Prime Minister and former prime ministers”. Interestingly, after UAE agreed to extradite Christian Michel  of Agusta Westland scam to India, veteran journalist J Gopikrishnan made another startling revelation. He claimed that Christian Michel who is alleged to have organised bribes in exchange for a 2007 purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters during the UPA era, was once the agent of Rafale’s firm Dassault in India. He asserted that if India gets Michel, it might turn into a “nightmare for many”. After the news of Dubai agreeing to extradite Michel to India, the Congress had hurriedly decided to approach  the Central Vigilance Committee (CVC) to raise the Rafale issue. As of now, it appears that the allegations of a scam by either side are merely political rhetoric as neither side has been able to cite any proof in support.",2018-09-19,"Agusta Westland,BJP,bofors,bribery,Congress,Congress scams,Corruption,corruption charges,Dassault,Dassault Aviation,defence deals,defence minister,Defence Ministry,kickbacks,lobbyist,manmohan singh,N Sitharaman,Rafale,rafale deal,Rafale Scam,rahul gandhi,rajiv gandhi,sonia gandhi,UPA,vvip,Walmart",Rafale deal didn’t go through in the UPA era as ‘kickback’ demands were not met?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/rafale-deal-didnt-go-through-in-the-upa-era-as-kickback-demands-were-not-met/
553,K Bhattacharjee,"In an article  in The Print titled, “As if hounding Muslims wasn’t enough, BJP is now giving the same treatment to Sikhs”, Shekhar Gupta gives vent to his heart’s desire as he claims that the saffron party is now alienating Sikhs after Muslims. At best, the article is merely an elongated articulation of a misinformed opinion and t its worst, it could very well be an attempt to sow seeds of division within the country to serve the political interests of certain parties. Gupta writes in the article, “If the borders were opened here, literally millions of Sikhs and Sindhis would go (to Gurudwara Shri Kartarpur Sahib) for just a few hours’ pilgrimages. This is what Pakistani army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa promised Sidhu, who duly wrote to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to move it forward.” Funnily enough, both Pakistani and Indian authorities have refuted Sidhu’s claims and yet Shekhar Gupta perceives Sidhu’s words as gospel truth. Pakistan had denied  Sidhu’s claims and said that there was a wide gulf between the two countries and the Kartarpur Sahib issue cannot be considered in isolation. The Ministry of External Affairs has also clarified  that Pakistan has neither initiated any formal correspondence on the issue of Kartarpur Sahib nor agreed to include Kartarpur Sahib Gurudwara for Indian pilgrims under the bilateral protocol. Now, Pakistan has also come forward and stated that there has not been any formal communication on the matter. Quite clearly, Sidhu was either conned by his dear friends in Pakistan or he has concocted fiction out of thin air on the Kartarpur Sahib issue. However, his claims have been contradicted by authorities in India as well as in Pakistan. Under such circumstances, only a journalist who is more interested in peddling a certain narrative would take Sidhu’s words as gospel truth ignoring all the facts that point to the contrary. The article states, “Now, calling the Indian Muslims names, raising questions on their patriotism is bad enough. But you think you can get away with giving the Sikhs the same treatment? And really, do you want to teach the Punjabis in general and Sikhs, in particular, the virtues of patriotism? You need to go see a shrink. A really good one.” These are blatant biases of the author that twist his perception of reality far beyond what can be construed as efficient. The BJP has been attacking Navjot Singh Sidhu and the Congress party for making discredited claims about a Gurudwara as sacred to the Sikhs as the Kartarpur Sahib. It is unclear how exactly Gupta reaches the conclusion that the BJP is alienating Sikhs. At no point did the party denigrate the entire community or insult them or hurt their sentiments in any manner. Unless the author is suggesting that criticism of Sidhu is akin to criticizing the entire Sikh community, the article just does not make any sense. The author warns BJP towards the end, “You are playing with fire that could burn you, and much else.” I wonder if Gupta is watching the same spectacle as everyone else. By all accounts, Sidhu’s trip to Pakistan, his hugging the Pakistani Army Chief and then making dubious claims about Kartarpur Sahib, all of it has been a complete disaster for the Congress party. It is no secret that Pakistan uses fault lines within India to fan extremism. It is also no secret that Pakistan is spending a substantial lot in fanning not only Kashmiri separatism but also the Khalistan movement, both extremely detrimental to India’s interests. Given Pakistan’s ‘war by a 1000 cuts’ strategy, one truly wonders why Sidhu would fan controversy by evidently, lying blatantly. One also wonders why Shekhar Gupta would parrot the exact same lines that Pakistan wants to use to deepen the Indian faultlines. “India is terrible to minorities” is a line that Pakistan would use to radicalise Kashmiri youth. “India is terrible to Sikhs” is an argument that Pakistan would use in its quest to fan the violent Khalistan movement. By peddling these two lines even after Sidhu’s assertions have been proven false not only by India but also Pakistan, serves nobody’s purpose. Not India’s, for sure. Why would Shekhar Gupta peddle this line of argument is anybody’s guess. The article is really a word salad and the author ends up talking a lot and saying very little. It appears that the author was desperate to portray the BJP as anti-Sikhs. Bereft of any real opportunity to insinuate such a thing, he decided to interpret Sidhu’s political blunders as BJP’s antipathy towards the Sikh community.",2018-09-19,"BJP,Congress,Indo-Pakistan,Kashmir,Khalistan,media bias,Ministry of External Affairs,Minoritarianism,navjot singh sidhu,shekhar gupta,sikh community,Sikhism,Sikhs,The Print,UPA","India and Pakistan deny, but for Shekhar Gupta, Sidhu is a ‘BJP bashing’ stick that must be maliciously used",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/india-and-pakistan-deny-but-for-shekhar-gupta-sidhu-is-a-bjp-bashing-stick-that-must-be-maliciously-used/

Recently, after the Ministry of External Affairs punctured holes  in Sidhu’s excuse of hugging the Pakistan Army chief, saying that Pakistan has not sent any official communication regarding opening the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, Shiromani Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal had called Sidhu a ‘puppet’  who was ‘dancing to the tunes’ of Pakistan. Former Punjab chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal also had hit out on Sidhu and called him ‘mental’. Badal had also asked his call details to be probed, accusing him of having relations with the ISI and Pakistan. However, that seems to have triggered Sidhu to a meltdown. Sidhu, today, said that if Sukhbir Badal has got verbal diarrhoea, it is not his fault. “If he has a constipation of thoughts, it is not my fault,” Sidhu added. Now, even Pakistan government has officially denied  having sent any formal communication on the Kartarpur corridor.

556,Sambit Nayak,"In an unusual and unprecedented event, Puri police yesterday seized the Hangar and Helicopter  of Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys (IMFA) group, which is owned by Jay Panda’s family. While Jay has gone all gun blazing on Social media  saying it’s a vindictive move by Naveen Patnaik to stop his movements in Odisha, the administration is firm on its stance that there may be a procedural lapse by Panda while flying his chopper over Chilika lake and matter is under investigation. On 15th of September, Jay Panda did fly over Rajhans island. He took off from Bhubaneswar at 08:46 hours. Flew over Chilika-Puri-Konark en route to Garadpur in Kendrapada and reached Bhubaneswar at 13:26 hours. This is corroborated by the ATC at Biju Patnaik International (BPI) airport attested by the airport director Mr S.C. Hota himself. The flight plan was duly submitted and clearance was taken for the flight path. It was flying at the designated height of FL 500 (500 feet) as authorised by ATC. Both the airport director and co-passengers of The administration version, however, is a little different. To begin with, there were initial media reports about a seaplane landing in Chilika. It’s worthwhile to mention that, there were plans of a sea aerodrome in Chilika, to which CDA (Chilika Development Authority) had given a written submission on why it will be a threat to the fragile ecology at Chilika. It sees the largest migratory bird population in India during winters and also is a preserved site under Ramsar wetlands convention. A seaplane landing in Chilika can be a threat to the ecological balance and threaten the wildlife. However, the seaplane landing in Chilika was just a media report. The official FIR, filed by Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF), CDA, Binod Acharya, mentions a chopper flying over Chilika at a “dangerous height” endangering wildlife and human life. The FIR also mentions that the said event took place at 13:30 hours. Remember, ATC data corroborates that Jay Panda flew over Rajhans at 08:46 hours and by 13:26, he was back in Bhubaneswar. It is not clear, whether it was a seaplane or chopper that was flying over Chilika at 13:30 or if anything was flying at all. The statement from the airport director also says that they are not aware of any other movement over Chilika except Jay Panda’s chopper. That being said, what is also baffling here is, what is the criminality for which the hangar and the chopper have been seized. ATC establishes that the flight plan along with flight level was approved and authorised. Did Jay Panda deviate from the designated FL and flew dangerously low? FDR (Flight data Recorder – Black box) data can easily corroborate that. FIR states that the object flew over Chilika at 13:30 hours. ATC data attested by BPI airport director states Jay Panda was back in Bhubaneswar by 13:26 hours. While Puri SP says that the matter is under investigation, what was the hurry in seizing IMFA’s hangar and Jay Panda’s chopper, without substantial proof? They could have taken the FDR for investigation without seizing the entire thing. Also, Chilika isn’t a no-fly zone. Most flights from Vizag and Hyderabad to Bhubaneswar fly over Chilika. With past history of Naveen’s vindictiveness and relation getting sour between Naveen Patnaik and Jay Panda, this smacks of highhandedness by the administration at the behest of the Chief Minister. Whether, it’s actually Naveen Patnaik, who instructed the turn of events as it happened or Puri police just followed procedure following a filing of FIR becomes immaterial. The unusual action taken by police does raise eyebrows. State administration targeting Jay Panda through his family run business IMFA isn’t new after all. Earlier in 2017, when the crack between him and BJD became apparent, state government shut down 2 Chromite mines  owned by IMFA over flouting environment rules. Does Naveen Patnaik actually want to restrict Jay Panda’s movement in the state? Is he actually wary of Jay Panda? Only time will tell. However, as we had reported earlier , recently expelled senior member and ex-minister Damodar Rout is trying to get all expelled members of BJD under one roof and create an anti-BJD force. It may be natural that Naveen Patnaik will try to thwart any such threat by nipping them at the bud. However, this high handedness, whether under instruction from Naveen Patnaik or not, will give cannon fodder to Jay Panda’s camp. How the event unfolds politically, remains to be seen. The events have taken some bizarre turn and BJD MLAs are protesting in front of assembly with posters demanding the arrest of Jay Panda and Abhijit Iyer Mitra who was his co-passenger. This removes any doubt, whatsoever, that these series of events are politically motivated.",2018-09-18,"Airport,BJD,Helicopter,Indian Politics,Jay Panda,Naveen Patnaik,Odisha,vendetta,Vendetta Politics",Jay Panda’s chopper seized by Odisha police – Law and order issue or vindictive politics?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/jay-pandas-chopper-seized-by-odisha-police-law-and-order-issue-or-vindictive-politics/
557,Sambit Nayak,"Dr Damodar Rout, ex-senior leader of Biju Janata Dal was dismissed  from BJD by party president Naveen Patnaik, on 12th September. This doesn’t come as a surprise, though. Dama, as he is popularly called, is known to be a motormouth and speaks out of turn which often embarrasses the party in the public sphere. Perhaps the last straw was when he accused  BJD of being run by 3 MLAs Debashish Samantray, Arun Sahoo and Bobby (Pranab Prakash) Das led by an officer. Who is the officer he was hinting at, is anybody’s guess. Dama was perhaps the last senior member of the party, who was associated with it since its inception. All other members have been systematically driven out. Naveen Patnaik is now the only person in the party carrying forward the legacy, whatever of it is left, of Biju Patnaik. Dama, though a motormouth, is not entirely wrong when he says that party is run by the younger lot. Of course, the final decision lies with the supremo but the daily affairs of the party are definitely being taken care of by the younger lot which doesn’t go well with seasoned members who feel they are being sidelined in the party. That is one of the primary reason, seniors have been revolted in the past and shown the door. Amongst the founding members, late Nalini Mohanty, Dilip Ray and Bijay Mahapatra were the first in the lot to be been dismissed  from BJD in early 2000 for their “utterances against Naveen Patnaik”. BJD has seen a series of dismissal of senior leaders over the years. The significant being Late Pyarimohan Mohapatra, Prafulla Ghadai, Jairam Pangi. Jay Panda and Dama being the latest to fall prey. Reasons are the same, barring Pyari who allegedly tried a coup  against Naveen when he was in London. Dilip Ray, Jairam Pangi and Bijay Mohapatra have joined BJP and Dilip Ray is currently an MLA. Except Dilip Ray, most leaders have faded into oblivion after being expelled. There have been other similarities as well. These leaders, after being expelled, have tried their fortune with forming new regional outfits. While Bijay Mohapatra tried with Odisha Gana Parishad(OGP) which later merged with INC, Pyari babu experimented with Odisha Jana Morcha. To say, these were failures, will be to put it politely. Jay Panda, who was thought to be close to BJP, has not taken any decision yet. On one occasion, he has hinted that he is still open to contesting as an independent or forming a new party  and implied about his bigger ambition. The reason why Jay Panda has not taken any decision on his political future may lie in the fact that, though he was seen close to BJP, he isn’t viewing BJP as the party which can fulfil his bigger ambitions or it may be the other way around. BJP leadership may be wary of what Panda can bring to the table. Dama babu has also hinted at something similar. In fact, he has made  it clear that while he won’t be joining BJP or Congress, he will definitely contest elections and one doesn’t need a party ticket to serve people. Of course, it’s the politician Dama Rout speaking and must be taken with a pinch of salt. Dama has gone as far as naming  all those who have been expelled from BJD to come together and form a new party to contest elections in 2019. It’s interesting to note that soon after news of his dismissal became public, Jay Panda paid him a courtesy visit, which of course in public is said to be non-political. It will be worthwhile to mention that both Dilip Ray and Bijay Mohapatra are unhappy in BJP as well. Bijay Mahapatra may not even get a BJP ticket to contest while Dilip Ray may opt out from contesting with a BJP ticket if the central leadership doesn’t fix things. Dama has named both of these gentlemen along with others to come together and pose a challenge to BJD. However, Naveen’s popularity has not seen a great dent. He still is the undisputed popular leader of Odisha. A new party with political heavyweights may not see any remarkable success. Ideologically, if this party is to be formed, it will be more leaning towards BJP. What it can do best is to cut vote shares of BJP and in some cases BJD, but going by past precedents it is unlikely that the party will see any significant electoral fortunes. Maybe, like OGP, which since its formation had allied with Congress before merging with it, this new party may try similar experiments with BJP. 2019 elections are still a few months away and as they say, a week is a long time in politics.

According to the reports , the central government had objected to the decision of the top court to entertain the petition filed against the arrests of five ‘Urban Naxals’ for their alleged links with left-wing terrorists. The Centre said the lower courts should have been approached first against the arrests of the five activists rather than the filing petition in the country’s top court.

562,Guest Author,"The institution which boasts of upholding highest standards of democratic values witnessed the lynching of the same democratic values at the hands of Left party and its other alliance partners. The Student Union Election in JNU this year was held on 14th September 2018. Like every year since 2014, this year’s election too, was hyped up. Mainstream Media took special cognizance of the JNUSU election. Staying true to its biased attitude, media did not cover a few important things. ABVP Presidential candidate Lalit Pandey, during his speech in Presidential debate, was continuously interrupted by the Left candidates. Their political masters in parliament and assemblies have taught them well, of course. Left, sensing the increasing support for ABVP in the campus resorted to cheap tricks and published posters in ABVP’s name with mala fide intentions. Since ABVP did not back out despite these strong-arm tactics, Left goons in the campus showed their true colour (read as red). After voting concluded in the evening of 14th September, counting process started around 10:30 pm in School of Languages (SLL). Before the counting starts, Election Commission is supposed to make minimum 3 calls to polling agents of the candidate. According to the Rule 5 (b) of Part 3 of Appendix 1 of JNUSU Constitution, no vote should be counted without the presence of counting agents of candidates. All ballot papers, while being counted, should be displayed to the candidates or a person authorized by the candidates. This rule was highly disregarded by the EC. The announcement was made only twice. ABVP representative reached the vote counting centre after the second announcement was made. In spite of this, the authorized ABVP representatives were not let inside the counting centre so that the Left gets a free hand to manipulate the polled votes in the absence of ABVP representatives. For 40 minutes, ABVP representatives kept pleading with the guards to allow them entry into the counting centre. Even after the guards conveyed this to EC, the EC remained adamant about continuing with the counting process in the absence of ABVP representatives. This resulted in ‘booth capturing’ by the left so as to manipulate the already casted votes. This may take some of the older (most of them) leftists in the campus down the memory lane when they would do the same in West Bengal, Kerala, and other parts in India. The ‘booth capture’ is not surprising at all because leftists’ fear of losing elections to ABVP could be sensed from the fact that they added another alliance partner. To add to their agony, the voter turnout in SL and SLS, which are strongholds of ABVP, was higher than expected. While everyone was aware of 4 alliance partners, the 5th one came to the fore on the day of counting — the Election Commission! Sensing the bias with which the vote counting was being dealt with, ABVP started its protest with the demand to allow their representatives in the vote counting centre. Despite their continuous protests, demands of recounting of the already counted votes fell on deaf ears of the EC. Looking at the support ABVP garnered for their protest, rattled Left parties listened to their basic instinct which would have made their late chairman Mao proud, and launched a brutal physical attack on protesting activists of ABVP. SFI and AISA goons were on the forefront of attacking ABVP activists. In this attack, many ABVP activists, including were severely injured. Some of the protesting activists, including National Secretary of ABVP Nidhi Tripathi, had to be admitted in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital Left, disregarding any gender considerations, tore clothes of a protesting girl. When Sujal Yadav, an ABVP activist tried to stop Left goons from beating ABVP girl activists, Leftist beat him and broke his hand. So much for Freedom of Expression and Right to Dissent which the Left keeps preaching about! What they preach and what they practice in reality have nothing to do with each other. The irony, which has died several deaths at the hands of leftist goons in JNU, died once more today, when the left goons, after bashing up protesting students still claimed that they stand for democracy. It is the travesty of International Democracy Day that in the capital of world’s largest democracy, utter disregard was shown to its core principles of dissent, dialogue and due process. In this manner, democracy in JNU was laid to rest. But what the Left did not realize is what they were burying was not a dead body, but the seeds of democracy which will grow again and thrive.

563,Nirwa Mehta,"With 2019 general elections less than a year away, the grand old party is all set to prop  their party president, Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate. Even as the allies are not particularly happy,  one is given to believe that the Congress party, as has been the norm, won’t be able to look beyond the dynastic protege as their leader. Rahul Gandhi is not a very astute politician. He fumbles often and loses the plot while speaking to an audience almost always. While the Congress has tried its best to convince people, time and again, that Rahul has come of age and has grown into his family thrust role of an astute politician, his natural charm betrays the campaign. As an example of Rahul’s beautiful mind betraying Congress’ campaign, one looks at a video from yesterday, when at his rally in Madhya Pradesh , the first after his Mansarovar Yatra , the Congress president was caught unawares by an audience member who asked him to share his Yatra experience. Like a true Delhi boy, Rahul Gandhi perhaps mixed up Kailash Mansarovar with Greater Kailash, the posh South Delhi neighbourhood and took time to realise the question was about the pilgrimage. After the lady master of ceremony asks him the question about his pilgrimage experience, Rahul Gandhi, with a vacant, confused look on his face nods his head and says “haan” (yes). After that, for a few seconds, Rahul drew a complete blank. Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia, standing on either side of Rahul Gandhi keep staring at him. There comes a point where one thinks that perhaps it is the video that has frozen until the angle changes and one sees Rahul Gandhi, keeping mum, from a side angle. Finally, Rahul manages to mumble the word “Kailash” and then keeps mum for a few more seconds. He then mumbles “Kailash… jo Parvat hai… jo Mansarovar hai….”. One is forced to wonder what causes this bizarre behaviour from someone who aspires to lead a country like India. The first thought, considering the controversy surrounding his Mansarovar Yatra, is wondering whether the questions surrounding his pilgrimage had any merit to them. After all, how can one draw a blank when asked about a journey he supposedly took just a few days ago. The other possibility is that perhaps Rahul’s interactions are not as impromptu as Congress would have us believe. One wonders if it possible that Rahul is given a script to follow and these long, vacant, confused pauses surface when the interaction, briefly, steers off plan. The ‘out of syllabus’ theory gathers steam since this is not the first time that Rahul Gandhi has faltered when a surprise question is thrown at him. Recently, during his UK visit, when he was asked to explain his political ideology, Rahul Gandhi drew a similar, creepy, eerie blank. One is reminded of Tom from the popular Tom and Jerry show. Tom usually looks as confused when he hurts his head while chasing Jerry. One theory that has often been floated is that during an interaction, Rahul somehow has someone feeding him the answers, and these surprise questions take time to process. In the meantime, Rahul ends up looking rather silly. None of these theories can be proven. But when the Reluctant Prince of Indian politics draws a blank every time an out-of-syllabus question is asked, one wonders how credible, then, are his accusations if he can’t even substantiate them? For example, during his UK visit, Rahul Gandhi had mentioned how PM Modi had ‘failed’ in handling the 2017 Doklam crisis . However, when an audience member asked him about how he would have handled the crisis, Rahul Gandhi said how he does not have the details on the Doklam issue and hence he could not answer how he would have handled the same. Any political observer must ask if it is possible that Rahul Gandhi is so far from reality that he has no clue what his speech writer is writing? That if someone asks him a question which strays from the written script, Rahul Gandhi fumbles. Or if answers are not provided  to him on a mobile phone, he does not know what to say.

564,OpIndia Staff,"Participating in the NDTV Yuva conclave organised  by controversial English News Channel NDTV , former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav regretted not killing a journalist who had criticized him. Narrating the incident, he said that once an article published in a newspaper had compared him with Aurangzeb. On investigating, Yadav found that there were ‘powerful people’ behind it. Without naming these ‘powerful people’, Yadav hinted that when PM Modi wanted to find black money with Samajwadi Party leadership, they could not find any. Instead, they found Amar Singh. He added if the front page of a large newspaper like Times of India has published this, there must be very large forces behind it, but he refused to divulge if he thinks some industrial houses were behind it. Referring to the mail purportedly written by Samajwadi Party’s political advisor Steve Jarding where he had advised orchestrating the family feud, which was claimed to be fake, Akhilesh Yadav said that just yesterday he told the person responsible for the mail that it is his mistake that he didn’t file FIR against him and send him to jail. This was applauded by the audience, although moderator Ravish Kumar tried to question this threat of filing FIR. After that Yadav went on, saying “I had invited a senior journalist from Delhi to Lucknow. I told him for this much money you compared me with Aurangzeb? I am ready to give you twice the amount, had you told me that you need money. I left him also”. Then he said, “this is the mistake I made, I should have drawn a sword like Aurangzeb and I should have killed that person at that moment’” Surprisingly, this comment received an even louder applause from the audience. Ravish Kumar did try to protest this open threat to kill someone, but Akhilesh Yadav justified by saying that he was angry that he was called Aurangzeb. Ironically, Ravish Kumar had started the show by showering praises on Akhilesh Yadav’s tolerance. He introduced Akhilesh Yadav as someone who handles criticism well and as someone who had never sent his party workers to intimidate a journalist like Ravish Kumar. Following his arrogant remark on wanting to kill people as Aurangzeb did, various questions were asked by press freedom champions like Nidhi Razdan and Sunetra Chowdhury. However, none of the journalists present has raised a question on Akhilesh Yadav’s dictatorial comment. Earlier in 2016 also, Akhilesh Yadav had claimed  that Amar Singh had planted a story in a newspaper where he was called Aurangzeb and Mulayam Singh was called Shahjahan. It can be noted that in July last year, former SM leader Amar Singh had compared  Akhilesh Yadav with Aurangzeb. Referring to tussle for power that was going between Akhilesh and his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, Amar Singh had said,  “Akhilesh Yadav is Aurangzeb, power has gone into his head and Mulayam Singh Yadav is like Shahjahan”. Recalling how Aurangzeb had put his father Shahjahan in jail to gain the throne. And last week, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had also compared  the former UP CM with the infamous Mughal emperor. Adityanath was also referring to the spat between Akhilesh and his father and uncle. Addressing an event he had said, “someone who could not take his father and uncle along claims he will take you along. A character in history jailed his father. This is why no Muslim names his son Aurangzeb. Now the same is happening in SP and history is repeating itself”.",2018-09-18,"Akhilesh Yadav,Amar Singh,aurangzeb,Death threats,Journalists,Mulayam Singh Yadav,Murder,NDTV,samajwadi party,Uttar Pradesh,violence,Yogi Adityanath","In presence of NDTV’s Ravish Kumar, Akhilesh Yadav wishes to have murdered a journalist",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/ndtv-ravish-kumar-yuva-conclave-akhilesh-yadav-aurangzeb-sword-kill/
565,OpIndia Staff,"Nayamuddin Shaikh, brother of Sohrabuddin Shaikh revealed  to a special CBI court on Monday that the CBI had on its own added the names of Gujarat police officer Abhay Chudasama and BJP president Amit Shah to his statement recorded in 2010 relating to the Sohrabuddin encounter. Nayamuddin appeared as the first prosecution witness after the court had issued numerous summons and also a non-bailable warrant against him. In his deposition to the court, he said that the CBI was the reason for spoiling the case. Nayamuddin has also revealed to the court that he had given a handwritten affidavit before the special court in Ahmedabad clarifying that he had never said any things that are wrongly attributed to him in his 2010 statement. This high profile case is related to the encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, his wife Kausar Bi, and aide Tulsi Prajapati. The CBI had earlier given clean chit to Chudasma and Shah in the encounter case. He clarified that he is not facing any threat  whatsoever from the BJP. “I have never heard Azam Khan’s name. An investigating officer of the CBI, Dagar sahab, came to my village in an autorickshaw to inquire about this case. I have not said before him that Azam (Sohrabuddin’s associate and co-accused in Hamid Lala murder case) met me and said that Abhay Chudasama offered Rs 50 lakh to withdraw a petition filed in Supreme Court to inquire into the death of my brother,” Nayamuddin told the court. Appearing at the special CBI court on Monday, Nayamuddin said that he had last seen his brother and sister-in-law when he dropped them off to a bus stand at Indore when they were travelling to Hyderabad. He went on to say that he got to know about the encounter days after his brother went missing. He then denied charges that Gujarat Police officer Abhay Chudasma had threatened him for naming Amit Shah in his petition. The CBI in its charge sheet recorded Nayamuddin’s statements, which reads , “When I told him (Chudasama) that we will not withdraw the petition at any cost, he threatened me with dire consequences and said that I would also face the same fate as Sohrabuddin. You do not know Amitbhai is very angry. I will speak to Amitbhai and he can get it done in Madhya Pradesh only. It is Amitbhai’s government there and you will be killed for making him a party in the petition,” Nayamuddin’s statement cited in the CBI’s charge sheet stated. Nayamuddin, however, has said that this part of his statements was added by the CBI officer DS Dagar in 2010. He claims that he had asked the CBI officer the reason for including these fake statements attributed to his name and he said that the officer replied that he did not want innocent people to be punished.",2018-09-18,"Amit Shah,ATS,cbi,CBI probe,Encounter,fake encounters,gujarat,Narendra Modi,sohrabuddin encounter,UPA,UPA government,Vendetta Politics","Sohrabuddin’s brother hints at conspiracy: Amit Shah’s name added by CBI in 2010, had not named him",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/sohrabuddins-brother-hints-at-conspiracy-amit-shahs-name-added-by-cbi-in-2010-had-not-named-him/
566,OpIndia Staff,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union election, the counting of which is underway, turned violent as leftist goons reportedly attacked Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP)’s volunteers on campus. ABVP is the students wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). According to DU professor and JNU alumnus Abhinav Prakash, goons of Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and All India Students Association (AISA) even beat up girls and tore their clothes. According to Prakash, the SFI and AISA, student wings of Communists Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India Liberation, respectively, were attempting vote counting fraud for the voting which concluded on Friday. He said they (SFI and AISA activists) were upset that they may lose out to ABVP. He claimed that the Leftist goons had occupied the counting venue and were assaulting students who were opposing the same. He said that the violence is orchestrated to either carry out fraud in counting or getting the elections cancelled. According to Sunil Ambekar, National Organising Secretary, ABVP, some ABVP students have been admitted to hospital after being attacked by the Leftist goons. ABVP JNU President, Vijay Kumar has accused the Election Committee (EC) of not following proper election procedure. The ABVP has also accused the EC of attempting to rig the elections as despite the rules which state that either the candidate or their voting agent is present in the room and sees every paper ballot, the EC broke the seal of ballot box and started counting Central Panel votes without ABVP representative present there.

567,K Bhattacharjee,"As per a report published  by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), an independent bipartisan wing of the United States Congress, the secular nature of India is eroding due to the rise of Hindutva in the country. The report titled “India: Religious Freedom Issues”, which can be read here , states, “Religious freedom is explicitly protected under its constitution. Hindus account for a vast majority (nearly four-fifths) of the country’s populace. Hindu nationalism has been a rising political force in recent decades, by many accounts eroding India’s secular nature and leading to new assaults on the country’s religious freedoms.” The report makes use of multiple US and Indian government resources, in addition to liberal media outlets which their own President calls ‘Fake News’ and quotes various Indians including senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, to further its narrative. The report only takes into account the opinions of liberals to reach its conclusions and a contrarian point of view finds no place in its pages. At a time when the US is itself so divided as a country, perhaps their Congress will be better advised to focus on the rise of Neo-Nazis and various political leaders and vast sections of their media openly supporting  violent organizations like the Antifa. Most conspicuously, the report cites S.M. Mushrif when it states, “In 2016, Maharashtra’s former senior-most police official reportedly called for banning the RSS as “the country’s largest terror organization.” Mushrif was one of the individuals who had attended  the inauguration event of the book, ’26/11: RSS ki Saazish?’. Interestingly the book insinuates that the RSS conspired with CIA and Mossad to perpetuate the horror in Mumbai. It is interesting that the CRS accepts the assertions of a man as gospel truth who appears to have endorsed a book that blames the top US intelligence agency for the terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008. The CRS also appears to harbour a special grudge against anti-conversion laws. Its report says, “According to USCIRF, although these laws have resulted in few arrests and no convictions, they “have created a hostile atmosphere for religious minorities, particularly Christians,” and “Christian communities have long reported harassment and violent attacks in the states that have adopted anti-conversion laws,” largely as reaction to perceive proselytizing activities.” It also cites the annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) which states, “Advocate for the central Indian government to press states with anti-conversion and anti-cow slaughter laws to repeal or amend them to conform with international human rights standards.” The CRS would be well reminded that every nation has a right to protect itself from demographic invasion and drastic demographic shifts cause great damage to the social fabric of a society, which are often irreparable. And Hinduism, unlike the Abrahamic faiths, does not have proselytizing as one of its integral tenets, thus making such provisions necessary to protect itself against such aggressive faith systems. The report says of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill , 2016, which would grant citizenship rights to persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries, “If enacted, it thus could violate the Indian Constitution’s equal protection provisions.” Perhaps the CRS is not aware of Indian history and the Indian subcontinent. India was partitioned on the basis of religious faith, Pakistan and Bangladesh were formed as a consequence. We, as a country, do not owe citizenship rights to those whose ancestors participated in the partition of the Indian nation as they were granted a great chunk of land for themselves and the generations to come. And people of Indic faiths are persecuted in those countries to this day. Thus, it only makes sense that only persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are given citizenship rights should they so desire. The report also raises concerns about the crackdown  on NGOs that receive foreign funds from the current administration. It says, “Human rights watchdogs have found their activities constrained under the Modi government, and they express concerns about Modi’s commitment to minority rights, his past willingness to tolerate suppression of free expression, and the vigour with which some of his supporters have quashed dissent.” The NDA government has shutdown thousand of NGOs for non-compliance with the FCRA laws. As we have documented in our ‘Demystifying Civil Society’ series, NGOs that receive foreign contributions from abroad are often involved  in political activism in the country and other such contentious issues  of great social significance. Under such circumstances, it is of critical importance that the Indian government monitors such NGOs to ensure that foreign elements are not destabilizing Indian society. It is also crucial to mention that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also blamed  US-funded NGOs for the protests against the Koodankulam Nuclear Project. The inherent biases of the report is revealed by the fact that Muslim intolerance  is completely ignored. It is commonplace in India for Hindu festivals to be attacked  and yet not a single account of Muslim atrocity against Hindus finds mention when it rakes up the issue of mob lynching. When the report raises the issue of cow vigilantism, it fails to appreciate the menace of cattle smuggling  and how poor farmers are robbed of their livelihood by these criminals who often take up arms against law enforcement authorities. When it raises the issue of the campaign against ‘Love Jihad’, it fails to take into account the fact that there is strong evidence  which suggests that radical Islamic organizations like the PFI are involved in a concerted campaign to brainwash Hindu women and convert them to Islam. The response  of the Indian government to such biased reports thus far has been, “India does not take cognizance of internal reports of a foreign country.” And it is the correct stance to adopt in response to an internal report of a country that prides itself in moralizing without holding itself to the same standards. More importantly, the report is a relic of the establishment that still occupies most corridors of power in the US despite Donald Trump’s election to power. President Trump has been a pleasant departure from the constant patronizing  that came with Barack Obama.",2018-09-15,"anti-minority,BJP,Cattle mafia,Citizenship Amendment Bill,CRS,hindutva,Islamic Fundamentalists,mob lynching,mob violence,PFI,religious conversions,RSS,US Congress,USA","US report blaming Hindutva for ‘rising intolerance’ is disingenuous, biased and motivated",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/us-report-blaming-hindutva-for-rising-intolerance-is-disingenuous-biased-and-motivated/

Referring to media reports on the allegation by Congress President, the agency’s spokesperson said that the allegations are baseless. The statement said,  The CBI has said that the decision to change the lookout notice was taken at the appropriate level of the agency according to the standard process, and it was not done by any individual officer. It said that the decision to change the notice against Vijay Mallya was taken because at that time there was not sufficient ground for CBI to detail and arrest him. Regarding Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, the agency said that CBI had received the complaint about them from Punjab National Bank almost a month after they had left the country. Therefore, the question of any CBI officer having any hand in their fleeing the country does not arise. It adds that prompt action was taken by CBI in the case immediately after the complaint was received from the bank.

Over the past few months, Parrikar has travelled to the US for his treatment and has fulfilled his duties as Goa CM’s using technology. However, now it seems, he may have decided to let his treatment take a front seat. There are 2 distinct possibilities here at play: A. Parrikar continues as CM, albeit with no charge and all his portfolios are redistributed to ensure all ministries function. B. Parrikar resigns as CM and a new face is appointed. Whereas Option A seems easy, practically it might be a challenge to run a Government without a CM in the state, even though he has no real duties per se. Option B is going to be something very difficult to manage for the BJP. Going back to last year, when this coalition Government in Goa was formed, politically opposite parties like the Goa Forward Party (GFP) and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP, along with independents, chose to ally with BJP with just 13 seats (as compared to Congress with 17), only on the condition  that Manohar Parrikar be the CM. He was seen as the only acceptable face for a BJP led coalition, and hence he was sent to Goa from Delhi. Now, the very face which enabled BJP to conquer Goa is in jeopardy. And as a corollary, the BJP led Government is also on a sticky wicket. As things stand, Goa does not have a Deputy Chief Minister. This post was probably not filled to avoid controversy over who should be the Deputy CM: next in line BJP minister Francis D’Souza? MGP leader Sudin Dhavlikar? GFP leader Vijai Sardesai? Hence, when Parrikar was in the US for his treatment, instead of a single person, the above 3 people were drafted  into a Cabinet Advisory Committee (CAC). Now, as Parrikar is out of action. These 3 people come into focus by default. Unfortunately for BJP, D’Souza is not an option as he himself is in the US for treatment, and is not expected  back anytime soon. This has prompted MGP President Deepak Dhavlikar, to prop up  his brother Sudin’s name. “It is high time Parrikar hands over the charge to the senior-most minister for [the] smooth functioning of the government” he is reported to have said, hinting at his brother. This move but will not go down well with alliance partner GFP’s leader Sardesai who has said , “It is not necessary that the second senior most minister has to be made the CM”. Not only will it diminish Sardesai’s and GFP’s status (who have the same number of MLAs as MGP), MGP is also ideologically far away from GFP. Another alliance partner, and minister in the state Government, independent MLA Govind Gaude has also objected  to this move by MGP. The reason for this is: Gaude is a bitter rival of the Dhavlikar brothers and had won in 2017, by defeating one of them. There is also talk of getting MGP merged into the BJP, since the two are not too far on an ideological stance. This would pave the way for Sudin to become a BJP CM. This move though has been rejected by MGP leaders. Such a move would finish any sort of bargaining power MGP has in the future, by virtue of being kingmaker. The BJP’s other options within are bleak. BJP’s Minister Pandurang Madkaikar is also sick  after a brain stroke. Even a fit Madkarikar may not have been considered considering he has been a recent import into the BJP and is not seen as an efficient administrator. The other 2 ministers from BJP are Mauvin Godinho and Vishwajeet Rane. Both are Congressmen inducted into BJP recently, and they may go against them. In spite of this, Rane is said to have launched a bid for the CM’s post, which has irked other alliance partners. Out of the other MLAs BJP has, most of them are considerably “junior” with little or no experience. None of them can be said to be a pan-Goa face, like Parrikar. Sardesai for CM might be too much of a deviation for the BJP, from its core ideological stance, and as of now, he is not a contender at all. He will though have a major say in the developments, holding 3 MLAs, in a state which needs 21 MLAs to form a Government. Now, the BJP may have to explore options such as its Lok Sabha MPs from Goa. First up is North Goa MP Sripad Naik. He is probably the second senior most BJP leader in Goa, after Parrikar. He has been Union Minister in both NDA Governments and can be considered to have a Pan-Goa appeal. However, he is not seen as a shrewd politician who is able to handle the requirements of such a tricky alliance. Moreover, he was demoted in the Central ministry, from Tourism to AYUSH ministry, indicating that Modi doesn’t have much faith in him. He may have been retained as a minister, only due to seniority. Worse, he doesn’t enjoy a great relationship with Parrikar. It is believed that this strain stemmed from the repeated attempts by Naik to re-enter Goan politics, often causing embarrassment to Goa BJP and Parrikar. Most recently in August, Naik had told  the press that Goa BJP leaders planned to meet BJP leadership in Delhi, over change in Goa’s CM. Eventually, the meet never happened as the other Goa BJP leaders returned to Goa after meeting Parrikar in a Mumbai hospital. South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar could emerge as the dark horse, at least from BJP’s stable. He is a first time MP but is fairly non-controversial. If he can be worked as the compromise candidate, he could fit the bill. He has an RSS background, hence would not be an issue for BJP. Convincing allies might be a different ball game though. Finally, BJP may have the option of importing someone from Congress. Rumour mills were abuzz over past few weeks that former Congress CM Digambar Kamat may rejoin BJP, with some other Congress MLAs. Kamat was a senior BJP minister but jumped ship to Congress in 2005. Kamat’s biggest drawback is that he is synonymous with Goa’s mining scam. He continuously held the Mining portfolio across Congress and BJP Governments, when the scam was said to have peaked. One of Parrikar’s plank for 2012 elections, was to bring to book, the mining scam accused. How will that go on if Kamat becomes the CM? If no solution is workable, what happens? The Congress has 16 MLAs and needs only 5 to form a Government. But the Congress is a divided house, with intra-party tensions often simmering onto the public forum. This lack of unity, was one of the main reasons  why they failed to form the Government in 2017, although they were the single largest party with 17 MLAs. The allies refused to deal with such a divided party. Will they change now? MGP (3 MLAs) has in the past allied with Congress and thus would probably have no major issues in rejoining Congress. GFP (3 MLAs), fought the elections on an anti-BJP plank, so Congress could be considered a more natural ally. However, GFP leader Sardesai is deeply suspicious of Congress, as its leadership thwarted him often when he was part of the Congress. The others include 1 NCP MLA and 3 independents, who on paper, may not be too averse to ally with Congress. But can the Congress make it happen? A divided local unit, coupled with an uninspiring central leadership, versus the shrewd combination of Modi and Amit Shah. Sounds like a cliff-hanger.

582,Saket Suryesh,"wrote Pablo Neruda in his much popular poem ‘ When the silence rises in the current political scenario where Rahul Gandhi and his associates are too keen to rewrite and manipulate their own familial history to capitalize on a resurgent Saffron wave sweeping across the nation, to which they credit the rise of Narendra Modi; one can only pause and lament such cynical shamelessness of the Congress and their prodigal prince. Mostly men are helpless creatures of their circumstances and better remembered than judged past their times. Their lives must, however, be read, understood and analysed so as to understand whether the circumstances then created must be amended or allowed to perpetuate till eternity. Forgetting is neither a solution, not appropriate. Congress, however, has always had a narrow politics-centric view which forced them to modify, manipulate and even malign the history to suit their current political designs. We often complain that the Congress has erased from our modern history anything which is non-Congress. We are wrong there. As I had pointed out in my previous post on Lokmanya Tilak, they have been equally brutal with their own. As Sonia Gandhi took the mantle, given her own history of decade-long contemplation on taking Indian citizenship, then taking the whole constitutional structure for a ride by becoming a parallel power structure without constitutional accountability; the Congress went with a vengeance of anything in the history which wasn’t only non-Congress, rather they clinically anything which was non-Family. In the process, they graduated from erasing non-family personalities in Congress to erasing even family personalities who stood independent of Nehru-cult even from within the family. The same family which went great lengths expressing grief over the demise of DMK Patriarch at the age of 94, forget to post even one message commemorating the death anniversary of Grandfather of Rahul Gandhi (or Ghandy) and Father-in-Law of Mrs Sonia Gandhi on the 8th of September, who left with his life largely unlived at the age of 48. Today is his Birthday and if we go by the silence today on his birthday. The Congress scion, the Grandson, who in his urge to prove his Brahminical antecedents hasn’t even bothered to even retweet a solitary, customary tweet placed by the party commemorating the Birth Anniversary of his Parsi Grandfather. Congress and Congress-leaning Political Pundits, refuse to believe this rejection of Congress is due to misgovernance and corruption of the government and utter disdain towards national sensibilities and political decorum. Their favourite theory is that suddenly the Hindu majority population of India, which has always been tolerant and welcoming to conflicting faiths and ideas, has grown intolerant and has chosen, in Narendra Modi. Thus, the only way to correct this aberration is to become Hindu-er than BJP. They tend to ignore how the whole lot of Hindus pleaded with the Congress to give the second term to the most-loved President of India, who incidentally was a Muslim, and was hated by the Congress. So now that the alignment with the Churches in North-East has failed, declaration of Congress as a Muslim party has failed in bringing political benefits to the party, being Brahmin is the next bet for the party which continues to fall on the scales of political and public probity. In such an environment, where the political strategy is limited to establishing Rahul Gandhi as Janeudhari Brahmin, a Parsi Grandfather does not fit into the narrative. This could probably explain the singular and solitary  impersonal tribute to the Congressman and Grandfather of Rahul Gandhi from the Party, and an absolute and confounding silence from the Prince himself whose grandfather’s birth anniversary it was today on the 12th of September, 2018 (well, the death anniversary too passed this week only on 8th of September and was treated by the Congress with equally cold silence). The current Congress leadership has been using the surname of the same gentleman, after twisting “Ghandy” to Gandhi, giving the impression of being the inheritor of the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, by virtue of having Feroze Ghandy as the grandfather, whose surname sounded similar; but refuses to acknowledge the existence of the man whose name they continue to milk shamelessly. This is, however, not the tendency of the current breed, rather this has been the trend since long. The way his name has been buried under the Earth is an example of the vengeful forgetfulness of the first family of their own who do not fit in the narrative and their grand idea of divine right to rule over this nation. Books and books have been written about Nehru, Indira and the family, but rarely would you find any biography of Feroze Gandhi. The family has been pushing any memory of his into the oblivion with a steadfast silence that for a family which has painted the country “Nehru-Gandhi”, we do not find even a mention, forget the memorial of Feroze Gandhi. In his book “Feroze: The Forgotten Gandhi”, Swedish writer Bertil Falk laments how there is so little of material in public domain available for the man who once held such prominent place in such a prominent family. When he set about to write the biography, and in the process of research, came across Mr PD Tandon. He quotes Late Shri PD Tandon, senior Journalist who observed the Nehru Family over three generations as a loyalist, very closely, who responded to Mr Falk’s statement that he thought that Feroze is underestimated with “ He too had no answer when asked by Falk as to why would a man like Feroze not deserve even one decent biography. All that we have in the name of this extremely honest and well-written biography of Feroze Gandhi is a biographical sketch by Feroze’s associate from Rae Bareli Shri Onkar Nath Bhargava, published in 1971 and another by Shanti Bhushan’s  Feroze Gandhi could quote from Bhagwad Gita extempore, spoke pure Allahabadi dialect and was a true middle-class Parsi, unlike foreign educated Nehru who came across the realities of rural India only when he came across the peasant movement, when in his thirties. In spite of wild speculations about something as basic as the religion of Feroze Ghandhy, the Nehru Family maintained a studied silence. Feroze was born to on 12th September 1912, in Mumbai, fifth child to a simple and religious Gujarati Parsi, Jehangir Faredoon Ghandy and Rattimai Commissariat. He was adopted by his maternal aunt, Shirin Commissariat, who was the first Parsi woman to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and was in-charge of Lady Dufferin College. Bertil Falk puts to rest two rumours about Feroze Gandhi, namely that of a Muslim father named Nawab Khan and another of a rich Hindu father named Raj Bahadur Kamla Prasad Kakkar. Feroze as a boy remained aloof of the turbulent politics of the time for long. This despite the fact that when the Prince of Wales visited India in the middle of raging local hostilities against the British in the aftermath of Jalianwala Bagh massacre on 11th November 1921, he was escorted to the port in safety by Jehangir Fareedon Gandhi. The prince was accompanied by his young relative Louis Mountbatten. Feroze was in Allahabad at that time, under the guardianship of his aunt Shirin. His first brush with the freedom movement was when he was Sixteen in 1928, most likely accidental. One day, Feroze saw a frail woman fainting under the summer sun protesting against the British outside Ewing Christian college and jumped to help. This woman was later to become his Mother-in-law and was called Kamala Nehru. On 1st of April, 1930, Feroze left school and joined the freedom movement. Feroze was imprisoned in 1930 for taking part in Civil Disobedience movement. Feroze organized 1932 movement in Allahabad. Feroze was a ground-level worker and not an eloquent speaker. He was promptly arrested once again. When he came out of the prison in 1933, he proposed to Indira Nehru. Feroze was Twenty-one then and Indira, Sixteen. Indira refused believing it was too early to get married. Feroze by that time, at the age of Twenty-one, was no longer a political novice, having been to the prison thrice. Feroze accompanied Mrs Kamala Nehru to the Sanatorium in Bhowali in her last days. When Indira was sent to England for studies, Feroze was to follow her, armed with a recommendation from Nehru to study in the London School of Economics. His days there were primarily spent in activism, working with Krishna Menon for India League. Bertil quotes a confirmation of Feroze’s stint in London from Emma Caseley, Acting Alumni Relations Manager of London School of Economics Foundation. She wrote to Bertil and I quote from Bertil’s account: He never returned to LSE after May 1938, but he did not return to India either. He stayed put in London. Of the five years, Feroze spent in London, he studied for Eight Months. He did not receive his graduate degree. Indira moved to Switzerland from London at the end of 1939 and stayed there for around one year. Feroze was to return to India in 1941 only, with Indira as his fiance. They married in 1942, after initial opposition of Nehru. Feroze was not much welcomed in the family and as per Aruna Asaf Ali’s account, Nehru’s sister Vijaylakshmi Pandit resented this new addition to the Nehru family with the same intensity with which she disliked Kamala Nehru. While she called the former “Mill-operator’s daughter, this new man in the household was from “a shopkeepers’ family”. in 1942, when Police crackdown happened, Feroze with his earlier history of freedom struggle was a much bigger name than Indira. He was sent to the prison for the fourth time in his life, this time after a gap of Nine years. Next few years, before and after independence was spent by Nehru in trying to tame the young men, domesticating him and putting him in a job which would match the status of the elite Nehru family. He was initially installed in the National Herald as Director-in-Charge in early 1947. The then Manager, TN Singh resigned. It was Feroze who was to lead the organization to bankruptcy. To be fair, Feroze tried his best but lacked intellectual heft or academic background to run a Newspaper. As fate would have it, Feroze entered into the Constituent Assembly from Uttar Pradesh, at the behest of the then Chief Minister and a good friend of Nehru, Shri GB Pant and became the last person to sign on the Constitution on 24th of January, 1950, Nehru being the first to put his signature. Feroze was slipped into parliament silently and silently he stayed there, until 1952, when he decided to earn what he got as Nehru’s son-in-law. In 1952, Feroze decided to drop out of the by then, bankrupt media house and contest elections from Rae Bareli. He remained a silent backbencher in the parliament for long and then on 6th of December, 1955 decided to make a speech which attacked the Government for corruption like never before, charging Bharat Insurance Company owned by Dalmia-Jain Group with misappropriation of funds to the tune of 22 Lakh rupees. This resulted in the nationalization of about 250 Insurance companies and merged into Life Insurance Corporation of India. His another speech on 16th of December,1957 about Mundhra Scam charging a conspiracy between Haridas Mundhra and the Government, he made then Finance Minister, TT Krishnamachariresign and earned for himself the name of Giant Killer. This time LIC was on his target, having made dubious investments in Mudhra’s companies. A committee was appointed under Chief Justice of Mumbai High Court, MC Chagla. The committee confirmed wrongdoing, sentencing Haridas Mundhra for 22 years. Quite unlike Rahul Gandhi, Feroze Gandhy was quite meticulous in his research and substantive in his charges. The way a middle-class Parsi man has been erased out of not only family history, rather also out of the collective memory of the nation, does raise questions about the first family of Indian polity whose own record and built-up reports of hardships faced in the independence struggle seem to be trumped up and exaggerated, to say the least. This is not an attempt to judge the past through the eyes of the present. This is an attempt to understand the present in the light of the past.",2018-09-14,"Congress,death,Feroaz Gandhy,Feroz Gandhi,INC,Indira Gandhi,rahul gandhi",The politics and the necessity of forgetting Feroze Gandhy,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/the-politics-and-the-necessity-of-forgetting-feroze-gandhy/

Another Maoist leader Vetti Rama, who was carrying a reward of Rs. 8 lakh turned himself in before senior officials at the Sukma police headquarters. , Kamlesh Ganju is wanted in more than a hundred cases registered by the police of Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Jharkhand. He was also carrying a reward of Reportedly  25 lakh on his head, police said. Ganju, who joined the group in 1993 at the age of nine, was later part of terror outfits including the erstwhile MCC and Peoples War Group. Indrajeet Mahatha, SP of Palamau said that Kamlesh Ganju is part of the Naxal network for the past 23 years and was the leader of Maoists group in Budapahar. Kamlesh Ganju was the mastermind behind the killing of 17 security personnel in 2013 in Jharkhand’s Latehar district. Interestingly, Kamlesh Ganju claims that the reason behind his surrender is that Naxals have lost their loyalty towards Maoism. He also added that another reason for his surrender is his family responsibilities and prevailing ills in his community. Vetti Rama, another top leader, is responsible  for the Sukma blasts in March this year in which Naxals had blown up a mine protected vehicle, killing nine security personnel. Reportedly, Rama had joined the left-wing terror group in 1995 and was responsible for several major Naxal attacks. The disgruntled Naxal said that increasing pressure of security forces combined with state’s surrender policy has been the major reason for a large number of surrenders. The DIG Sundarraj P told that during his interrogation , he has revealed crucial details about the Maoist urban network and sympathisers. “Rama revealed that sustained operations by security forces in Chintagufa, Kistaram and Bhejji- considered as core areas of Maoists in Sukma, coupled with development works, resulted in the Naxals’ hold weakening in the area”, the DIG said. The Naxal cadres in the tribal areas are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the ideology and are willing to join mainstream for a better life. Recently, Pahad Singh, one of the important leaders of the Naxal terror network, has also surrendered  to the Chattisgarh police. He was carrying a bounty of Rs. 1 crore and is believed to have been involved in over 80 cases against him out of which 40 cases have been filed in Gadchiroli alone. Recently, Pahad Singh in an interview  to OpIndia has revealed a lot of sensational aspects of the Naxal terror network operating in both tribal and urban areas. Singh in the interview has revealed the ‘modus operandi’ of the Naxals and the connection of ground forces with its urban network. Interestingly, Pahad Singh went on to identify Arun Ferreira, one of the arrested Urban Naxals  and claimed that he had met him in a meeting of the banned CPI-Maoist. Pahad Singh has described how the so-called ‘intellectuals’ deceive and exploit the simple Adivasis  and use them to further their agenda. Pahad Singh, who refers ‘Urban Naxals’ as ‘Nithalla buddhijeevi’ (jobless intellectuals), blames the urban network for the sufferings of the Adivasis, as he says Urban Naxals want to keep the Adivasis deprived of development so they can use them to further their own selfish motives.",2018-09-14,"Arun Ferreira,communists,Congress ecosystem,CPI M,CPIML,Exclusive,interview,Left Wing,left wing terrorism,left-wing extremism,Maoists,Naxalism,Pahad Singh,red terror,Sudha Bharadwaj,surrender,urban maoists,urban naxals,Varavara Rao","Key Naxal leaders with heavy bounty surrenders, spill the beans on the urban network",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/key-naxal-leaders-with-heavy-bounty-surrenders-spill-the-beans-on-the-urban-network/
584,OpIndia Staff,"We had reported earlier that rifts within the BJP-IPFT alliance had been developing for sometime over various issues. Things reached  a climax when there were violent clashes between the workers of the two parties over the submission of nomination papers for the panchayat elections. And now, it has surfaced that leaders of the tribal wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party want to sever ties  with the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT). Janajati Morcha (ST frontal organisation) president Sanjoy Debbarma accused the IPFT of spreading chaos across the state. He said, “They are spreading chaos. Development works of the state government are worst hit due to this. Common people are fed up with their activities.” The demand has been placed before the president of the state unit of the BJP and Chief Minister Biplab Deb. “We have urged the CM to remove IPFT from the alliance. He told us that the coalition was agreed upon by BJP’s central leadership and assured us that the problem will be discussed with them,” he said. Rampada Jamatia, state vice-president of the BJP and Janajati Morcha leader, has claimed that his house was attacked by IPFT workers. He also mentioned that many other leaders were attacked including Golaghati MLA, Birchandra Debbarma. “MLA Birchandra Debbarma lodged an FIR with the police. IPFT supporters have held attacks on his family to force him to withdraw the FIR. They are also involved in criminal offences in different parts of the state. We have demanded that legal action be taken against them and the alliance with IPFT be severed immediately,” he said . Meanwhile, IPFT spokesperson and assistant general secretary, Mangal Debbarma accused the BJP of starting clashes and then blaming IPFT for it. According to him, certain BJP leaders were involved in a shrewd conspiracy to disrupt the alliance as they could then occupy the cabinet seats that would fall vacant as a consequence. “If we leave the alliance, two posts in the cabinet will be vacant and indigenous leaders in BJP can grab those seats. They are plotting to disturb the alliance for this reason,” Mangal said . Meanwhile, Mangal reignited the commitment of his party towards ‘Tipraland’, a proposed separate state for tribals of Tripura. “We want Tipraland and shall continue the struggle for that. We don’t care how many seats we get in the government. If BJP thinks they can run the government without us, then so be it. They have the single majority. But the indigenous people are with us,” Mangal said. Earlier, the IPFT along with a few other organisations had announced  their decision to launch a statewide movement for a separate Tipraland soon. Amidst such hostility, national general secretary of the BJP, Ram Madhav and organisational general secretary, Ajay Jamwal, are set to arrive in Tripura on the 16th of September to check the party’s preparation for the Lok Sabha Elections and end hostilities between the two allies. “A meeting is also scheduled with IPFT leaders to put an end to the ongoing hostility between BJP and IPFT, coalition government’s two partners”, said  party state general secretary Rajib Bhattacharjee on Thursday. The BJP already has a single party majority in the state assembly after winning 36 out of the 60 assembly seats in the previous state elections. Thus, they have the luxury of severing ties with the IPFT should they so desire. However, it is likely that their popularity among the indigenous people of Tripura will be affected should the alliance collapse.",2018-09-14,"BJP,BJP-IPFT coalition,IPFT,Janajati Morcha,ram madhav,Tipraland,Tripura","Rifts wide open between BJP and IPFT in Tripura, tribal leaders want to end alliance",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/rifts-wide-open-between-bjp-and-ipft-in-tripura-tribal-leaders-want-to-end-alliance/

586,OpIndia Staff,"Five-time Congress MLA Karan Singh Dalal has been suspended  from the Haryana assembly for one year after he and the Leader of Opposition and INLD chief Abhay Singh Chautala hurled abuses at each other and then went on to indulge in a ‘shoe-fight’ during a heated last day of the ongoing assembly session. The Speaker of the house Kanwar Pal Gujjar had to call the marshals to control the members present in the assembly. The speaker then suspended Dalal after a resolution for his suspension was moved by Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu, which was promptly supported by INLD. The minister had moved the resolution against the Congress MLA for allegedly using derogatory language and misconduct. It was passed by voice vote in the assembly. According to the reports, Dalal had a heated exchange with Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Chautala, which incidentally went out of control as Chautala advanced towards Dalal with a shoe in his hand, while Dalal also took out his shoe against the Leader of Opposition Chautala. The speaker had to call the marshals to prevent both members from hitting each other from shoes. The Congress members present in the assembly, including former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, held Dalal’s hand to stop him from hurling shoes at Chautala. It is reported that Karan Singh Dalal used an objectionable  word, which the ruling BJP legislators objected to and was later expunged. State ministers Anil Vij, O P Dhankhar, Manish Grover and Captain Abhimanyu criticised Dalal for using the objectionable word that would “bring disrepute for Haryana”. They claimed that Dalal had not only insulted the House but the entire 2.5 crore population of the state. Karan Singh Dalal, after getting suspended came out of the assembly and said he would approach Punjab and Haryana High Court against his ‘illegal’ suspension and questioned why there was no action against Chautala. “I was not granted an opportunity to explain things and no ruling was given by the speaker whether the world was parliamentary or unparliamentary,” Dalal said. Bhupinder Singh Hooda lashed out at the government saying that BJP was misusing its majority in the House. “If Mr. Dalal has said something, I and my party apologise on his behalf. I have also been a four-time Lok Sabha MP and am a four-time MLA, but never before have I seen such a situation where opposition MLA is suspended without being given a chance to explain his side,” Hooda said.",2018-09-12,"assembly,Congress,Congress MLA,Haryana,rahul gandhi,shoe thrown,shoes,speaker","Haryana: Congress MLA Karan Singh Dalal and INLD chief Abhay Singh Chautala hurl abuses in Assembly, indulge in shoe-fight",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/haryana-congress-mla-karan-singh-dalal-abhay-singh-chautala-shoe-hurl-abuse/
587,K Bhattacharjee,"In recent times, we have witnessed a revolutionary transformation in the Congress party. Gone are the days when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said minorities have the first right to resources in the country. Now, the Congress party has been working overtime to paint itself in saffron hues. Consistent with its current trend of peddling ‘Soft Hindutva’ in an effort to win elections, senior leader of the Congress party, Dijvijaya Singh, has stated  that the government will construct the ‘Ram Path’ (a route that is said to have been taken by Lord Ram during his 14-year exile) should his party come to power. “The ruling BJP had announced to develop the ‘Ram Path’ but never kept its promise. But, we are thinking to construct the ‘Ram Path’ up to the borders of the state. The ‘Narmada Parikrama Path’ would also be constructed,” Singh said  at a press conference in Bhopal. The Congress party has a rather complicated history with Shri Rama, to put it mildly. In 2007, the UPA government at the Center had filed  an affidavit in the Supreme Court which asserted that there was no historical evidence for the existence of Shri Rama. In the Ram Mandir dispute, appearing for the Sunni Waqf board in Court which opposes the Ram Mandir, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal made attempts  to delay judgment in the case and wanted the hearing to be adjourned till after 2019 general elections. Defending Triple Talaq in the Court, Sibal had also said , “If Hindus’ faith about Rama’s birth at Ayodhya can’t be questioned, then triple talaq, a matter of faith for Muslims shouldn’t be.” Then there was Congress MP Hussain Dalwai who had invoked  Shri Rama in the Triple Talaq debate that had ensured and said Rama had also left Sita after doubting her. The Congress mouthpiece, National Herald, had also come out in support  of the propagandist masquerading as a historian, Audrey Truschke, who had called the Hindu God a “misogynist pig”. Given its history of minority appeasement at the expense of Hindu rights, the Congress party has been working extremely hard trying to shed its anti-Hindu image. Congress President Rahul Gandhi went on an exhausting Temple Run  ahead of the Gujarat elections which did not help them too much in the end. After the controversy at Somnath Temple where Rahul Gandhi allegedly declared  himself to be a non-Hindu, the Congress party proclaimed  him to be a ‘Janeu-dhari Hindu’. While we welcome the Congress party’s recent move to embrace the Hindu cause as it would felicitate a Hindu centric polity where the rights of the Hindus are duly respected, there is a certain contradiction between their words and actions. The Congress party has been at the forefront  of stoking tensions after the NRC draft, which is absolutely crucial to remove illegal immigrants from the country. After being elected the Chief Minister of Karnataka with support from the Congress party, Kumaraswamy met  with the member of the radical Islamist outfit PFI, an outfit that has been accused of brainwashing Hindu girls to convert them to Islam. Reports  had also emerged of an arrangement between PFI and Congress for the Karnataka elections when the latter withdrew its candidates to help the Congress party. Thus, it appears that the Congress’ tilt towards Hindutva is merely a ploy to garner Hindu votes as their actions betray their true intentions.",2018-09-12,"2018 Assembly Elections,anti hindu,Congress,Digvijay Singh,hindutva,Kapil Sibal,Lord Ram,Madhya Pradesh,rahul gandhi,ramayan,Rampath,Soft Hindutva","Congress promises ‘Rampath’ in MP, as the party’s tilt towards Hindutva continues",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/congress-promises-rampath-in-mp-as-the-partys-tilt-towards-hindutva-continues/

In that course a roundabout at Baalson crossing had to be reduced a bit. This particular roundabout has 3 statues. Nehru’s statue was coming in way of proposed layout. Hence it was removed and stalled at same place after acquiring around 10 feet of space,” the government said .

595,OpIndia Staff,"Addressing a gathering of 2,500 delegates at the World Hindu Congress, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has asked  Hindus to come together and organise themselves, saying “if a lion is alone, wild dogs can invade and destroy him”. Speaking at Chicago, Mohan Bhagawat asserted that Hindus have suffered for thousands of years and they “never come together”. Bhagwat also said that the Hindu community has no aspiration to be dominant and the community will prosper only when it works together as a society. “Coming together of Hindus itself is a difficult thing. In the initial days of our work, when our karyakartas used to go and talk to Hindu eminences about organising the Hindus. They used to say sher kabhi jhund mein nahi chalta (a lion never travels in a pack). But even that lion, that Royal Bengal tiger, king of his own jungle, if he is alone, wild dogs together can invade and destroy him,” he said. Mohan Bhagwat also spoke  how Hindu community has given the most meritorious persons to the society in every aspect of life and said that they never come, stay or work together. The World Hindu Congress, with the theme of ‘Think Collectively, Act Valiantly’ was organised drawing inspiration from the Hindu epic ‘Mahabharat’. Bhagwat emphasised the implicit tolerance of the Hindu Dharma and said that in Hindu dharma, even a pest is not killed, but controlled. “Hindus don’t live to oppose anybody. We even allow the pests to live. There are people who may oppose us. You have to tackle them without harming them”, Bhagwat said. “Hinduness does not mean any mode of worship or subscribing to any God. Think about the absolute truth.” Mohan Bhagwat said a sense of idealism is good and described himself as ‘pro-future’ rejecting the opponents claim of being ‘anti-modern’. He said that Hindu society is both ancient and postmodern. According to Bhagawat, Hindu Society is ahead of twenty years in its thoughts and ideas. Further, he said that Hindus have been suffering for thousands of years because they forgot to practice its basic principles and spiritualism. The RSS Chief in his speech spoke  about the need for coming together to strengthen the Hindu society. He added that Hindus should learn to work together and take an initiative to enlist all good meaning people and unite the people which he believes is “need of the hour, need of the time, the duty of Hindu society and the Hinduness of every one of us”. Bhagwat said that there will be so many Hindu organisation and many individuals taking along everyone with us and said it is important to adjust our opinions. His comments, however, drew severe criticism from the Opposition. Attacking Bhagwat for his comments, All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said  the RSS was demeaning others by calling others dogs and assuming themselves as tigers.

596,Monica Verma,"Nepal and China have finalized  the protocol text of the Nepal-China Transit and Transport Agreement. This agreement is set to allow Nepal access to Chinese ports, including Tianjin, Shenzhen, Lianyungang and Zhanjiang open seaports and Lanzhou, Lhasa and Xigatse dry ports in China for third country trade. This agreement is being touted within the Indian media as an end of India’s monopoly over transit rights to Nepal. While such agreements definitely make good headlines provided the popular frame of looking at China’s increasing involvement in South Asia as an act of undercutting India’s influence but ground realities are very different. Being a landlocked country, Nepal relies on access from neighbouring countries to participate in international trade. With India, mainly two agreements govern the transit: the India-Nepal Treaty of Trade and Transit and the India-Nepal Rail Services Agreement. Nepal uses Kolkata and Haldia ports for its international trade where Kolkata port handles mostly containers and Haldia port handles heavy cargo such as coal and cement. Around 6,000 of Nepalese containers are moved through the West Bengal ports compared to just 150 for Bhutan. According to some estimates, 90% of Nepal’s international trade is routed through these ports. Off late there has also been a trend to route Nepal’s imports through the Vishakhapatnam Port due to importers concern with rising costs at the ports located in West Bengal. Due to its landlocked status, Nepal is dependent on Indian ports for its trade. There are always minor issues involved with the use of these ports such as cost factors and delays etc. However, a blockade at the India-Nepal border in 2015 where Nepal’s essential supplies were cut-off for a period of two months triggered anti-Indian sentiments at another level altogether. The blockade was caused due to protests by Madhesis demanding a greater representation in the country’s new constitution. But the government in Nepal started viewing it as an “unofficial blockade” by the Indian government in solidarity with the Madhesis who ethnically, in terms of language and culturally have a resemblance to people in the Indian state of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This understanding of the Nepalese government led it to look for alternative options for transit trade. Even during the blockade, China came to the aid of Nepal by supplying essential commodities and fuel providing relief to some extent. While Nepal under KP Oli’s Prime Ministership has taken a number of steps to increase economic linkages with China. There has been a sharp departure in China’s policy as well towards Nepal. While earlier it was content with the Himalayan Kingdom paying lip-service to the ‘One China’ policy and keeping Tibetan activists under a hard watch, now China has started to actively cultivate its influence in every manner possible- investments, outreach initiatives, cultural diplomacy, academic exchanges et al. While this can worry India at many levels but as far as the transit rights are concerned, Himalayas continue to remain the most important challenge to the Nepal-China transit story. Any talk of China allowing access to its ports or a rail-link substituting the existing transit trade must be carefully weighed in on the basis of the facts at hand. The ports that China has promised to provide access to are roughly more than 3,000 Km away from Nepal. The nearest port is Zhanjiang which is 2,755 km away from Nepal while the rest of the ports are more than 3,000 km away. In trade, every kilometre of transit increases the cost of the final product. Traversing this distance in comparison to Kolkata which is 774 kilometres away and Vishakhapatnam which is 1194 kilometres away would entail exorbitant cost and time. In fact, the road infrastructure, especially from the Nepalese side, would require a high level of investments, something that Nepal might not be able to commit to owing to the size of its economy. China had earlier expressed its desire to supply petroleum products to Nepal. Nepal also showed interest in importing at least 1/3poses  of its requirements from China but difficult Himalayan terrain absence  a significant challenge to any meaningful fuel-trade between the two countries. The officials in the Nepal government are also aware of the challenge especially due to the awareness  of infrastructure on the Nepalese side. There already is an shown  amongst the policymakers that China will not be interested in commercially supplying fuel to Nepal if it is not economically viable for the country. Nepal Oil Corporation even signed an MoU with PetroChina to import fuel for Nepal from China however that agreement has not been implemented commercially. Plus, the Nepalese government has started granting petroleum import license to private firms who have  There is also a tendency to place hopes on the China-Nepal rail link through Tibet. China cannot fulfil Nepal’s fuel requirements even if the Tibet railways reach right up to the Nepal-Tibet border. First of all, providing access to Tibet is China’s own security pressure point. One of the reasons why China is interested in a healthy relationship with Nepal is because of the large Tibetan community whose activism if goes unchecked can become a nuisance. Opening Tibet to Nepal on a scale that trade relations normally require would be a security headache for China and it will surely prefer to avoid it. Secondly, the Kolkata-Raxaul railway line is a much cheaper and less costly alternative to the China-Nepal rail link. Because a rail link in the difficult Himalayan terrain requires heavy investments with mostly bridges and tunnels lining up the entire route. Is it logistically wise to depend on rail links in such difficult terrains for your key supplies? The railway project is clearly fraught with dangers. The contractors needed to work on the project have been tough to find because of health and environmental hazards. More than a 100 died during the construction of a small section only. The cost is again very prohibitive with even a conservative estimate putting  it at $16.1 Million per 0.6 miles. Long story, cut short, the fears of Nepal’s transit dependence on India being replaced by China are not new. The Araniko Highway, connecting Kathmandu to Tibet constructed in the 1960s has been used in the past also to play the China card against India. However, to imagine that it can handle volumes of cargo traffic that can fulfil Nepal’s essential requirement is impossible. In fact, this oldest infrastructural link between modern-day Nepal and China can’t handle Nepal and China trade alone. A huge quantity of goods continues  to come from China to Nepal through the Kolkata seaports. This highway has often fuelled many fantasies of China-Nepal trade but it is environmentally vulnerable to the extent that the friendship bridge that links the highway on both sides is reduced to just minor foot traffic after the 2015 earthquake. Thus, this link continues to remain one of the most dangerous roads in the world with frequent instances of landslides blocking access. In the current scheme of things, it looks very difficult that any transit rights provided by China to Nepal can end the historic relationship of transit and trade that exists between India and Nepal. In fact, Nepal’s own media believes that such agreements provide “psychological boost” at best and might reduce the “excessive dependence” of the landlocked country by India. Even they understand that China cannot replace India or end its monopoly. Nepal’s own foreign policy experts call  the transit agreement as posturing by Nepalese elites to please the public back home and send a message to India.",2018-09-09,"China,foreign policy,india nepal,International Relations,kolkata,Nepal,tibet,trade,West Bengal","China opens trade doors for Nepal, allows access to ports.

597,OpIndia Staff,"The Congress party, which has been going against the Modi government with all guns blazing over the Rafale deal, has curiously distanced itself from its own most vocal supporter and former media cell leader Tehseen Poonawalla, who is a close relative  of Robert Vadra. In a press release by Anoop George Chaudhary from the AICC legal cell, the Supreme Court unit of the AICC has clarified that they have nothing to do with the PIL filed by Poonawalla over the Rafale issue. The press release states that Poonawalla’s PIL seeks for the disclosure of the renegotiated price of the Rafale deal and the party explicitly denied any involvement in the PIL as it has been filed on Poonawalla’s individual capacity. The press release goes further to insist that the Congress party does not have even the ‘remotest’ connection with the PIL or Poonawalla and the party thinks that the apex court is not the forum for raising such issues. The letter concludes by reasserting that the party in no way can be linked to Poonawalla or his PIL. It is notable here that Tehseen Poonawalla , who is a vocal supporter of the Congress party and the brother-in-law of Robert Vadra, had filed a PIL in the SC seeking the disclosure of the renegotiated Rafale deal in March 2018 . While the Congress party has been incessantly attacking  the government over the deal alleging  that corruption has taken place and the deal was done to benefit Anil Ambani’s firm, the abrupt announcement of distancing itself from Poonawalla’s PIL is being questioned by many on social media.

598,Kushal Mehra,"Diversity and pluralism are beautiful. For Indians, diversity and pluralism are in their DNA. We are born and raised in a country where we have had multiple languages, multiple cuisines and a variety of philosophies/religions. The level of comfort an average Indian has with diversity at multiple levels including intellectual diversity is something the world could learn a lot from. But, this celebration of our diversity is based on some assumptions. It can only work when there are some basic shared values between all these diverse groups. So as these groups go about living their lives with their relative differences they agree on a certain set of common values. I would like to call those values “India’s Non-Negotiables”. But some of these Non-Negotiables have been under a constant assault in India. Elections come and go, but over the years the narrative in India has gone from being seriously annoying  to the theatre of the absurd . Especially, since the election of 2014 where Indians voted the Narendra Modi led NDA to power the assault on India’s Non-Negotiables has been amped up to a very high decibel. So what are these Non-Negotiables? What are these values/rules that should not be breached if we want to maintain the integrity of our nation? So here are some of the points that I believe should qualify as Non-Negotiables in India. There can be no compromise on the Nations integrity and National security. When it comes to issues like Kashmir, Naxalism, some areas in the North-East or some separatist elements in Tamil Nadu and Punjab, everyone irrespective of their political leaning should speak in a united voice. But does that happen in India? Let us examine a few examples. According to this India TV News Desk report  on August 30, 2018, Congress leaders are “Talking about inspiring and funding members of several students unions across the country over ‘BHU-like incidents’, one of the letters allegedly written by Comrade Prakash says that Congress leaders are willing to assist them.” The letters accessed by India TV allegedly state “We must intensify protests using students, state forces will be soft against students which will gradually put the state at a disadvantage while acting against us. Congress leaders are very much willing to assist us in the process and have also agreed to fund their further agitations whenever such opportunities arrive,” A few months ago on June 22nd Senior Congress leader Saifuddin Soz was quoted  by ANI saying “Musharraf said Kashmiris don’t want to merge with Pakistan… their first choice is independence. The statement was true then and remains true now also. I say the same but I know that it is not possible.” As if this was not enough former Cabinet Minister from the Congress Mr Kapil Sibal was speaking  to ANI where he was quoted saying that the current Indian Government should listen to the point of view of a separatist outfit like the Hurriyat. In the bid to score political brownie points over the current political dispensation the Congress party and the larger left ecosystem is willing to compromise India’s integrity and national security. This is a path which is fraught with danger. One would hope that the Congress party would learn from their mistakes in the past where it was their flirtation  with extremists that led to the Khalistan movement which culminated in the loss of many lives in Punjab and eventually cost us the life of India’s then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The monopoly of violence in any sane and civilised society has to be with the state. This is Non-Negotiable. But is that the case in India? Does India’s left ecosystem really believe in that? When students in JNU chant  “‘bandook ki nok pe lenge azadi’ (we will take freedom with guns)” what should be the response of India’s intelligentsia? How should the Congress party that is India’s premier opposition party behave? In any normal society, you would see all mainstream political outfits completely distancing themselves from such elements. But as we see time and again not only is the Congress party President meeting  the leaders of these separatist urban movements to encourage them, they take their assistance  when it comes to election campaigning. We have come to point in India where violence by Naxals has been defended and re-contextualised by “intellectuals” and “experts” on Twitter like @suchitrav where they say “Naxal movements have used violence – this is undeniable. But what is often lost in the analysis is this — the violence of the powerful  cannot be equated to the violence of the powerless.” A “secular” and “socialist” state should treat all its citizens equally. That is an absolute Non-Negotiable. There can be no discrimination on the basis of identity. But India is a unique nation where our former Honourable Prime Minister Shri Manmohan Singh during the 52nd address to the National Development Council was quoted saying  “We will have to devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share equitably the fruits of development. These must have the first claim on resources.” Yes, you have read that right, the former Prime Minister of India believes “Muslims must have the first claim on India’s resources”. A specific set of people in India should be given a preference in a basic claim on its resources. Leave the majority aside for once, I wonder what the other minorities in India think about this? I would like to end this article with one last example. For me, this is the supreme value in any secular democratic republic. That is the right to speak freely without any fear or intimidation. Freedom of Speech is a very important Non-Negotiable. But in India, we have seen a consistent assault on our right to speak from every single political outfit from time immemorial. It does not matter which state you live in India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari we have one common thread. These Twitter Threads on assaults on our Freedom of Expression by Congress  and BJP  by Anand Ranganathan expose the hypocrisy of our two premier political outfits and how they have muzzled our basic rights from time to time. Every political outfit will try to curb our right to speak freely by giving ridiculous arguments like “hurt sentiments”. What we have in the name of free speech in India is a farce. On any given day, any fringe group can basically get up and give threats, come on the streets, damage public property and even kill people sometimes because their sentiments are hurt by something written or spoken by someone. And they are able to get away with this with impunity because there is no law and order in India and in many cases, the government in power is tacitly involved in the harakiri. No society can survive and sustain itself without these Non-Negotiables. If we remove them, India’s diversity and pluralism will collapse. If they cease to exist, the very edifice of The Republic of India will cease to exist. There is a fine line, and that line needs to be defined. It does get updated from time to time as the moral arch of our society expands, but, it still exists and a dispassionate analysis of India’s socio-political climate today should give us a cause for concern. We have to stop looking at everything through the prism of victimhood and oppression. India is far more than a nation of tyrannical majorities and victim minorities. Unless this prism is challenged we will go on having these assaults on our Non-Negotiables. There is more to life than the game of Oppression Olympics and Victimology Poker. So I would end this article by asking all of you a few questions. Can everyone irrespective of their political affiliation agree that the values of free speech, equal treatment of every citizen and the integrity and security of our nation Non-Negotiable? Can we at least attempt to have this conversation in India? (I’ve already discarded the Marxists, but what about the rest of us?) If you think you have nothing in common with other socio-political groups why is it so? Share your reasons. Also, how can we build a healthy society in such a scenario?",2018-09-09,"BJP,Congress,Dissent,Freedom of Expression,Freedom of Speech,INC,JNU,Kapil Sibal,rahul gandhi,Saifuddin Soz,sonia gandhi",It is time that our politicians stop defiling and trampling over India’s Non-Negotiables,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/it-is-time-that-our-politicians-stop-defiling-and-trampling-over-indias-non-negotiables/

When Republic TV reporter, Piyush Mishra attempted to confront him, supporters of the party leader could be seen making efforts to intimidate the journalist. The Congress leader could be heard saying “Sorry” repeatedly, although it is unclear exactly what he was apologizing for. The apology could have been for his alleged role in the anti-Sikh pogrom that he is accused of, or to his party for embroiling it in a controversy by participating in the protest, or to the reporter conveying his reluctance to entertain his questions. Sajjan Kumar’s participating in the protests comes at an interesting moment. Only a few days, Congress party President Rahul Gandhi had denied  the involvement of his party in the anti-Sikh pogrom that was initiated by the assassination of the late Indira Gandhi during his foreign tour. Many had interpreted Rajiv Gandhi’s remarks as an approval of the pogrom by the top echelons of the Congress party. It is also pertinent to note that Captain Amarinder Singh had mentioned  Sajjan Kumar in the Punjab Assembly as a Congress leader who was involved in the pogrom. Sajjan Kumar’s participating in the Bandh also not received well on social media.

600,OpIndia Staff,"The debilitated left-wing terror groups after facing a heavy onslaught from the security forces seem to be struggling to recruit new members. According to the reports , the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is looking for new urban members and intellectual youth to assist the armed wing and educate tribals and Dalits. Reportedly, Naxal groups are facing a severe shortage of cadres, after the successful crackdown under the present NDA government. The CPI-Maoist party mouthpiece ‘Lal Chingari Prakashan’ has called for urban youth and intellectuals to join them, as the party is in a shortage of educated masses, said politburo member Prashanta Bose, alias Kishanda. The report  says that the CPI-Maoist has recently launched a retirement scheme for the aged and physically unfit leaders, who cannot operate from the underground and carry out its activities. Bose claimed that the biggest challenge for the party has been building a second line of leadership. He further admitted that the CPI-Maoist had failed to groom effective future leaders. This comes as the present government has been successful in cracking down on the Naxals-both in tribal and urban areas. “Except West Bengal, in areas of Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand we have created base among Dalits, tribals and the poor. So, in such a situation where the level of education is low, making them understand the real meaning of principles of Marxism is a tough job,” the 72-year-old leader said. He further added that party is in search of revolutionary, educated and intellectual comrades to train and educate the tribals, Dalits and the poor. It needs a lot of determination to train and educate the Dalit and the poor cadre of our party. The number of educated cadre in war zones is very less,” Bose said. According to Prashanta Bose, the banned outfit has asked  all its committees to send “educated students and its intellectual comrades, who are true to the principles of the revolution, to Left-wing conflict zones” as early as possible. He added that they are confident of finding such educated, young and dynamic comrades very soon and he said the party will start building a good third and second generation leadership. Last year, reportedly, the CPI (Maoist) central committee had adopted a resolution to relieve the leaders who are unable to fulfil their responsibilities and to provide work according to their capacity. This resulted in creating a vacuum in the mid and senior level leadership. The banned outfit has also prepared an organisational and political document along with a training manual to train next level leaders, but the plan is supposed to have failed. Coming down hard on Naxals, especially in Urban areas  has been one of the major achievements of the present government.

There were reports of hooliganism and vandalism that also trickled in from various parts of the country. However, amidst the news about the bandh from across the country, came some videos that gave us some amusement. Here are some: In Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh, few Congress workers were doing a procession while chanting slogans. Suddenly, they got confused and chanted “Rahul Gandhi Murdabaad”. In Belagavi, Karnataka, few AAP workers were doing a protest, but perhaps some workers were not aware of what they were protesting against. One of them demanded an increase in petrol prices! The result? The party leader present there immediately went to him and slapped him. Congress workers in Neemuch were not the only ones who were confused between zindabaad and murdabaad. Somewhere else, Congress workers were caught chanting Narendra Modi zindabaad slogan during today’s bandh. And this Pune man wins the internet today. The India Today reporter was expecting some usual comment against price rise and difficulty due to the bandh, but for this man, Congress is a bigger problem than anything else. He says Congress is the main problem. He also says even if petrol price becomes ₹200 it will be alright, but he doesn’t want Congress back in power. In Karnataka, Congress workers were enforcing the bandh by forcing shop owners to shut their shops, when suddenly a woman appeared on the scene and started chanting counter-slogans “Narendra Modi ki jay, Bharat Mata ki jay”, which resulted in Congress workers to chant slogans louder and one of them physically mishandled the lady also. In Udupi, Rikshaw drivers confronted Congress party workers with “Modi, Modi” slogan, forcing the bandh enforcers to retreat.

According to the Times of India report , the ED had prepared a list of companies last month, relating to the irregularities in the project. The ED while summoning these six companies said, “irregularities were observed during the course of the investigation which ranges from ‘excess payment’ to awarding contracts to blacklisted companies” as well as a mismatch in the contracted amount and released amount. The companies summoned by ED are Gammon India Pvt Ltd, KK Spun Pipe Pvt Ltd, Rishu Construction, Hightech Competent Builders Pvt Ltd and Tarai Construction. The ED report says that the state government made excess payment to these six companies while some of the other companies did not even receive the original amount sanctioned in the contract. It further says that one company named Tarai Construction was awarded 13 contracts and also excess payments were done to this company. Another company, Gammon India, despite being blacklisted  in many states was awarded two contracts involving the highest contract value of Rs.665 crore to a single company, which according to the ED was higher than the actual cost. KK Spun, another company alleged to have committed irregularities is said to have failed to even fulfil the basic requirement conditions for filing the tender. Interestingly, this company went on to register with the irrigation department after the tender was awarded to it, resulting in irregularities while awarding the contract. The ED officials said that some of the ministers and officials who worked under the previous Akhilesh Yadav government will be summoned in relation with the probe. Gomti riverfront development is a Rs.1,990 crore project commissioned in the year 2015 by the then UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to develop the riverfront along the Gomti river, which flows through the city of Lucknow.

605,OpIndia Staff,"Union minister Smriti Irani today launched a renewed assault on Congress, particularly on Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi while addressing media. Referring to Delhi High Court’s rejection  of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi’s plea challenging the Income Tax notice seeking tax reassessment for the financial year 2011-2012 in connection with the National Herald Case, she said  “The court yesterday produced yet another evidence of deep-seated corruption in the hallowed of Congress party”. She said, Rahul Gandhi had set up a company in 2010 “which professed that it will not indulge in profit and loss businesses, but ironically, Mr Gandhi went on to take possession of a company called Associated Journals, whose only function was publication of newspapers”. Smriti Irani added that as per media reports at the time of the purchase, Associated Journals was a commercial enterprise. She asked why Rahul Gandhi had purchased a commercial company with commercial activities while he had earlier said in his statement that he was not interested in profit and loss, and added that Rahul Gandhi should answer this question. The minister said that as per statements  of some Congress leaders and reported in media, a loan of ₹90 crore was given to Associated Journals, which was bought  by Rahul Gandhi’s company for ₹50 lakhs. She asked when in the history of India has anyone seen a 90 crore loan bought for only 50 lakhs. She recalled Rahul Gandhi’s statement to a journalist in 2012 when he said that, he and his company have no intentions of printing a newspaper. She said, “one can then question, why would you buy a company whose sole function was printing a newspaper, when you publicly declare that you have no such interest”. “When the income tax assessed, re-assessed, that declarations made by Mr Gandhi’s company were not correct, it is my belief after reading media reports, that Mr Gandhi and his family refused to answer the Income Tax officers on the basis of notice served to them”, the minister added. She asked, can any Indian citizen defy an income tax notice when asked to come and produce answers, adding, “why is it that Mr Gandhi, who is quick to hug the prime minister, would run a mile when it comes to an income tax office”. The minister asked, why Rahul Gandhi goes to court and says nobody should report on the happenings of the National Herald  case, when he presents himself as a supporter of free speech, why he wants to curtail free speech when it comes to his faulty income tax assessments. She said that this is the saga of corruption, a national hera-pheri that Congress party leadership is indulging in.",2018-09-11,"associated journal limited,Corruption,Delhi High Court,income tax,national herald,National Herald IT papers,rahul gandhi,smriti irani,sonia gandhi,subramanian swamy,Young India",Plea of Gandhis against I-T reassessment reveal deep seated corruption in Congress: Smriti Irani,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/plea-of-gandhis-against-i-t-reassessment-reveal-deep-seated-corruption-in-congress-smriti-irani/

609,Jhankar Mohta,"Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, who triggered a huge controversy from the moment he showed a keen interest in attending Imran Khan’ s swearing-in ceremony in Pakistan and later when Pakistan contradicted  his claims regarding the Kartarpur sacred corridor, is now again in the eye of the storm after he refused to comment on Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s speech on the occasion of Pakistan’s Defence and Martyrs’ Day on Thursday. Bajwa had  “vowed to avenge the blood being shed on the border of the country”, and said the Pakistani Army had been ‘valiant’ during the wars of 1965 and 1971. The aman-ka-tamasha has gone on for as long as one can remember. But after Prime Minister Modi assumed office in 2014, Congress and its functionaries seem to have found an ally in Pakistan after the people of India abandoned them electorally. Sidhu, who had proudly proclaimed that he has “Congress blood” running in his veins and had touched Sonia Gandhi’s feet during the plenary session of Congress is the latest addition to the litany of Congress leaders who are now seen cosying up to the enemy. Sidhu had clearly displayed  his Pakistan love (a country which has always been hostile towards India and uses state-sponsored terrorism as a weapon against India), by extending the ‘controversial hug’ towards General Bajwa and by sitting beside the President of Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) at the event. He was highly criticised  by many. Undeterred by the criticism, Sidhu was brisk in glorifying  the Pakistan government, now led by ‘Taliban Khan’, by thanking them for the “noble gesture” of making the corridor available for the pilgrimage. His intentions were questioned. His party was questioned. But Sidhu remained steadfast in his love for ‘Taliban Khan’.  Many even wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Saying perhaps, it was owing to his cricketing history that he was warm towards Imran Khan. But today, the benefits fade away and only doubts remain as he coyly said “no comments” when General Bajwa indulged in shaming India while indulging in state-sponsored terrorism against the country. Just as a leopard doesn’t change his spots, Congress and its leaders fraternising with the enemy should come as no surprise. On several previous occasions, Congress has publicly pretended to disassociate with comments that toed Pakistan’s line but ironically has always chosen to maintain silence when their leaders fraternise with Pakistan’s functionaries which is often, almost always, in direct conflict with India’s interests. Sidhu’s decision to visit Pakistan was defended by Congress. It was called ‘a step in the right direction’. The Congress also dismissed criticism about Sidhu not just attending Khan’s swearing-in at a time of national mourning over the demise of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee but also hugging the Pakistan Army Chief. Sidhu’s shenanigans aren’t very different from Congress leaders Mani Shankar Aiyar and Salman Khurshid who created a squabble over their remarks in Pakistan criticizing  Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Then too, Congress supported its leaders. Mani Shankar Aiyar, the Congress leader who is supposed to be close to the Nehru-Gandhi family and has been known  for his pro-Pakistan statements, courted controversy  when he hailed Mohammad Ali Jinnah for his role in the freedom movement and even referred to him as ‘Quaid-e-Azam’. In a bid to defend his statements on Jinnah, he later praised Pakistan for its ‘tolerance’ and prevailing conditions to express his views. The Congress party’s ‘suspension’ of Mani Shankar Aiyar had then come across as a sham  in a bid to control the damage by Rahul Gandhi and was eventually proved right as nine months after this pretence the Congress party chose to revoke the suspension  of this party member who has been a frequent visitor to Pakistan and has not shied away from expressing his love for the terror state, Pakistan. In a similar incident earlier, the controversial Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam had stirred a row  by calling the surgical strikes against Pakistan, ‘fake’ and has asked the BJP government to provide proof. That time too, the Congress was quick in exhibiting its pretence . On one hand, displaying their disapproval by distancing themselves from Sanjay Nirupam’s comment saying that the “Congress doesn’t agree with the statements made by Sanjay Nirupam, we have taken a serious note of it” and “The Congress fully trusts the Indian Army,” while on the other hand, advising the Government of India to share evidence to prove that the surgical strike had indeed been carried out. Remarkably, right at the same time, Pakistan was demanding for proof as well. It will be somehow justifiable if we believe that the Congress has a special proclivity towards Pakistan. Congress has always been inspired by Pakistan at a deeper, stronger level. Their behaviour has in fact been a subtle, slow reflection of Pakistan’s ideologies. Considering this, it is not surprising that not only the out-on-bail Congressman, Shashi Tharoor stood firmly by his ‘Hindu Pakistan’ remarks , but even his party refused to openly condemn it. They just gave an excuse that the remarks were made in Tharoor’s personal capacity. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also charged  Congress withholding a secret meeting with Pakistan delegates. The charges were earlier refuted by the Congress and later after a long spell of silence, a shoddy explanation  was provided. Similarly, last year, after repeated denials  Congress had accepted  Rahul Gandhi’s meeting with the Chinese ambassador amid a border row with China. Why would India’s principal opposition party meet envoys from Pakistan and China at all? And if they do meet, why should the agenda remain hushed behind closed doors and not revealed to the public. What is the public supposed to assume when Congres leader goes all out to hail Pakistan, because of whose hostility several Indian Jawans and innocent have had to sacrifice their lives, and urges Pakistan to help them ‘remove Modi’ and in the next breath, the Congress has also been viewed holding ‘secret meetings’ with Pakistan envoy? Sidhu’s drama will hurt the Congress but no more than its own predisposition to being sympathetic towards anyone who might help them regain power, even if the very sanctity of the nation was at stake.",2018-09-08,"BJP,Congress,Controversy,India-pakistan,Indian Army,mani shankar aiyar,national security,navjot singh sidhu,PM Narendra Modi,PoK,Pro-pakistan,rahul gandhi,Sanjay Nirupam,Shashi throor",Congress’ dangerous games: Distancing itself publicly while giving tacit support to its leaders fraternising with the enemy,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/congress-dangerous-games-distancing-itself-publicly-while-giving-tacit-support-to-its-leaders-fraternising-with-the-enemy/

Akbaruddin, who is also the floor leader of the AIMIM in assembly also made an aggressive remark on Karnataka’s Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy. Akbaruddin Owaisi had in 2012 delivered a hate speech  where the gist of which was that if the police presence was removed for 15 minutes, Muslims could show Hindus who is more powerful. Akbaruddin while addressing a gathering of followers in Hyderabad stated- “Our people will be successful, KCR said that elections in November and chief minister in December. To this I want to say that let elections happen in November, in December I will ask that who is supporting us? I will also ask if Kumaraswamy can, I can be CM too?

During a debate in assembly, he had stated that AIMIM-TRS combine had swept the GHMC elections the previous year and that they would repeat the same success in the next assembly elections. His comments had received thunderous applause from the treasury benches and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, too, had cheered by thumping his desk.

According to a report by India today TV, Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was chosen  by Rahul Gandhi as the leader of the Congress poll campaign in the state, has stated in a recent public rally that the people of Madhya Pradesh have only two options when it comes to choosing a leader.

He also added that he cannot say why Scindia has made such a claim. Fractionalism between Kamal Nath and Scindia supporters over CM candidature was apparent in Madhya Pradesh earlier too. In July, a poster war  of sorts had erupted between the supporters of the two leaders where Kamal Nath’s supporters were using slogans like  Though the Congress has denied any differences between the leaders, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh had taken out the ‘Ekta Yatra’ reportedly trying to bridge the gap between Congress workers.

Taking on Chandrasekhar Rao over the Rythu Bandhu scheme, Khuntia said that the caretaker Chief Minister should declare how much money was actually given to farmers and what was the amount he spent only on advertisements for the scheme, both in national and local media. He went on to say that during the TRS rule, sand and liquor mafia have had a field day.

616,Nupur J Sharma,"Teen Murti Bhavan, a sprawling property of 30 acres where the first prime minister of independent India lived, worked and died. The luxurious and, might I add, gorgeous property has served as a memorial for Jawaharlal Nehru. This Thursday, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library society decided  to construct a new museum inside the Teen Murti Bhavan in honour of other PMs – both former, as well as future ones, a proposal that was floated  in December 2017 by the Modi, led central government. As the decision surfaced, the loyal foot soldiers of the dynasty were, expectedly, up in arms. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh wrote  a ‘scathing’ letter to PM Modi, urging him to leave the Teen Murti Bhavan untouched. He accused the government of harbouring an ‘agenda’ to ‘change the nature and character’ of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) and the Teen Murti complex. Manmohan Singh also writes that Jawaharlal Nehru doesn’t belong just to the Congress, but to the entire nation. It is said that when History is erased, people’s moral values are also erased. It is also said that it is good to be proud of one’s heritage, but that pride shouldn’t be perverted. Congress seems to have perverted their pride in the Dynasty’s heritage to erase portions of history that don’t include them, thereby, attempting to corrupt the moral values of a society. India’s history encompasses all its leaders, past, present, future. The good, bad and the ugly. If the Congress is so concerned about the Country’s heritage and history, one has got to wonder why it would have a problem, or why it would think that history is being undermined by the inclusion of all others who are inextricable parts of it. Their reverence, or the lack of it, for other leaders of India is not unknown. The shameful treatment met out to former Prime Minister and Congress President PV Narasimha Rao. How Congress treats leaders who don’t belong to the Nehru clan can be understood by just these 2 lines from the book, Half Lion. Two lines that epitomise how former PM Rao was humiliated  in death. History means nothing to Congress. Heritage means nothing to Congress. One then recalls how Congress stood up tall in court to assert that Lord Ram was a mere fictional character and that the Ram Setu must be demolished. In 2007, the government in an affidavit  to the Supreme Court in the Sethusamudram project case had not only dismissed the existence of any man-made bridge between India and Sri Lanka but even questioned the existence of the characters of Ramayana. For the Congress, PV Narasimha Rao wasn’t a part of history. For the Congress, Ram Setu isn’t a part of Heritage. For the Congress, history starts and ends with the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, and heritage starts and ends with the monuments that glorify only the dynasty. Why else would they let Rao’s body be pulled and tugged by stray dogs? Why else would they want to allow the Ram Setu to be torn apart? Why else would they not even commemorate the Kargil war, terming it the BJP’s war? Why else would they actively work towards the Ram temple at Ayodhya never being built? Why else would they think history and heritage are being undermined if the memory of prime ministers other than Jawaharlal Nehru get the place they deserve?

Heritage starts and ends with structures that glorify him, and his lineage.",2018-08-27,"Congress,Dynasty politics,Jawaharlal Nehru,manmohan singh,memorial,modi government,museum,Narendra Modi,nehru,Nehru-Gandhi dynasty,Nehru-Gandhi family,Prime Minister Modi,PV Narasimha Rao,Ram Mandir,Ram Setu,Teen Murti Bhavan","Dilute Ram, preserve Nehru: How Congress’ position on Teen Murti exposes the party’s idea of heritage",https://www.opindia.com/2018/08/dilute-ram-preserve-nehru-how-congress-position-on-teen-murti-exposes-the-partys-idea-of-heritage/
617,Shashank Bharadwaj,"The Mahagathbandhan- it is an antagonistic setup and a loose coalition of some opposition parties sharing one common feature-Contempt towards India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The ‘Grand Alliance’, a combination of opposition parties which are sliding into irrelevance and facing an existential crisis against the strong, stable governments. This time, such sort of an opportunistic alliance is led by Congress party and has other regional players like SP, BSP from Uttar Pradesh, RJD from Bihar, Communist parties and Trinamool Congress from West Bengal and many other insignificant political parties from different states. The Grand Alliance, since the inception of the idea, has been facing severe credibility issues. The past governance record with their controversial involvement in many criminal and financial irregularities have made the voters stay away from this rhetoric. The leaders of the alliance are themselves embroiled in various financial irregularities and scams, are also now being prosecuted by various agencies and tried by courts. Most of the prominent leaders of the Mahagatabandhan are either convicted for scamming people or facing charges while out on bail for time being. Let us look at some of the ‘honourable’ leaders of the Mahagathbandhan, who are out on bail for committing various crimes and frauds over the years. National Herald scam  is one of the most notable legal cases in Indian history, as the Gandhis are directly accused. The Mother-Son duo, along with their aides – unconditional bail , who are out on bail, is alleged to have involved in massive ‘cheating and breach of trust’ in the acquisition of Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) by Young Indian Pvt Ltd (YIL), as assets worth crores of rupees had been allegedly transferred for purposes other than originally intended for a paltry sum. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi got  P Chidambaram, alleged to be the ‘brain’ behind the humongous UPA scams, along with his son has been facing tough times, as the investigation agencies have been unearthing  severe irregularities attached to the both P Chidambaram and his son Karti Chidambaram. The Enforcement Directorate has been chasing the former union finance minister for his alleged involvement in the irregularities during Aircel-Maxis deal of Rs 3,500 crore and INX Media case involving Rs 305 crore during his tenure as finance minister in the UPA-1 regime. P Chidambaram has been granted an anticipatory bail by the court which protects him from CBI arrests. Karti Chidambaram, like his father, has been accused  of involving in frauds and several other money laundering cases. He is alleged to be involved in both Aircel-Maxis and the INX media cases and is currently out on bail. Shashi Tharoor, the loverboy of the Lutyens cabal has been accused of abetment of suicide  in his wife Sunanda Pushkar’s mysterious death. The former Union Minister has been granted a regular bail , who has been charged under sections 306 (Abetment of suicide) and 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the IPC. The former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Virbhadra Singh has been facing several cases related  to corruption charges and disproportionate asset cases. The former Chief Minister is out on bail currently in a case related to corruption charges, as he was charged by the CBI for being involved in dubious financial transactions. Vikramaditya Singh is also accused  of involving in money laundering and accused by the ED, along with his father for being involved in creating illegal wealth. The Delhi Patiala Court had recently given him bail after CBI had registered a disproportionate assets case against him and his father. One of the most powerful leaders of the Congress, D K Shivakumar is also out on bail, after being charged  by the Income Tax authorities for tax irregularities. The Income Tax department carried out raids on more than 67 locations across New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mysuru and Chennai. Along with this, there are several leaders in the Congress who are facing probe and are out on bail. Sajjan Kumar, one of the masterminds of the Sikh genocide of 1984 under Rajiv Gandhi, is still facing charges and is out on anticipatory bail.  In fact, Congress leader Sunil Chopra’s bail plea  has been denied. He was involved in the alleged question paper leaks in the judicial officers. M Vincent,arrested Congress MLA Kovalam constituency is out on bail who was  Lalu Prasad Yadav has been found guilty  for indulging in series of fodder scams when he was the Chief Minister of Bihar and currently serving a total of 14 years in jail. He and his family, including daughter Misa Bharati and son Tejashwi Yadav, are facing several cases related to disproportionate assets and also for conducting benami transactions. The Son of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav-9th class failure, who was also the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar seems to be more interested in carrying his corrupt father’s legacy. Tejashwi Yadav, along with his mother Rabri Devi, who are out on bail now, has been accused  in the IRCTC scam for allegedly granting operational contract of two IRCTC hotels in Ranchi and Puri to a private firm, owned by Vinay and Vijay Kochhar, in return for a prime land plot in Patna in 2006. Gayathri Prajapathi, the former minister of Uttar Pradesh was arrested , along with six others for alleged gang rape of a woman and attempting to rape her minor daughter. The rape accused Samajwadi leader has been granted bail in April this year. The NCP leader was arrested in Chhagan Bhujbal by the Enforcement Directorate on chargers under Prevention of Money laundering act. The Enforcement Directorate on Monday attached  properties 290 acres worth Rs.55 crore in Nashik in connection with a money-laundering case against the former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, Chhagan Bhujbal. After two years of imprisonment, is now out on bail The Indian National Lok Dal, another prominent wannabe member of the Grand Alliance is also led by another scamster Om Prakash Chautala. He, along with his son Ajay Singh Chautala, one of the opposition leaders in Haryana is sentenced  to ten years imprisonment under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act for involving in the Haryana teachers’ recruitment scam case. H D Kumaraswamy and his wife Anitha are facing charges  in the Janthakal mining scam. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) is probing this scam on the direction of Supreme Court of India. He is accused of pressuring a senior bureaucrat to renew Janthakal Enterprise’s lease of iron ore mining for 40 years on the basis of forged documents and violating several rules. Earlier, he had moved anticipatory bails to avoid arrests from the SIT. Jignesh Mevani, the controversial MLA from Gujarat, along with Umar Khalid -one who was rusticated  from JNU for organizing anti-India events to honour terrorists, are charged by the Pune police for instigating violence during the Bhima-Koregaon protest. The police have registered a case under sections 153(A), 505 and 117 of the Indian Penal Code for creating enmity between groups. Hardik Patel, who was once the face of Patidar agitation in Gujarat, is now convicted  for causing riots in Mehasana. Hardik Patel has been found guilty of charges related to arson and creating a ruckus at the office of a BJP MLA Rushikesh Patel. Apart from these leaders, there are many other fellow friends and allies of the Grand Alliance, who are being probed for their questionable involvement in various cases including disproportionate assets, financial irregularities and even in heinous crimes like murders etc. The Mahagathbandhan is yet another sense of political falsehood offered by the opposition ranks to replace the existing government in the upcoming elections. The Opposition Parties devoid of any positive agenda, are mainly banking on Modi bashing aided its sycophancy intellectuals in the media. There are severe inherent contradictions within the coalition and it will be interesting to see how this rhetoric of so-called ‘Grand Alliance’ will play out next year.",2018-09-03,"Fodder scam,grand alliance,INX Media Scam,irctc,Karti Chidambaram,Lalu Prasad Yadav,mahagathbandhan,national herald,P Chidambaram,rahul gandhi,RJD,Shashi Tharoor,sonia gandhi,Tejashwi Yadav,Unholy alliance,UPA Scam",Here are some prominent members of the out-on-bail Mahagathbandhan,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/here-are-some-prominent-members-of-the-out-on-bail-mahagathbandhan/

ANI tweeted a copy of the decision issued by the state party unit. It says that party has decided to evaluate how active the aspiring candidates are on social media. And the social media activity will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: This is mandatory not only for ticket aspirants but also for all party office bearers and current MLAs of the party also. The order says that the Congress office-bearers, current MLAs and ticket aspirants must submit the detail of their Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp activities to the Social Media and IT Cell of Madhya Pradesh Congress by 15th September 2018. Interesting to note here is that, before Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017, BJP also had determined similar criteria for aspiring candidates for the election. Although the party did not issue an official order like MP Congress has done, according to reports  party president Amit Shah told the ticket hopefuls that social media presence of the candidates will be a factor in deciding ticket allocation. Given that BJP won a spectacular victory in the assembly election, virtually eliminating all of the opposition in the state, the Madhya Pradesh unit of Congress party seems to be following the similar strategy in picking to most winnable candidates.",2018-09-03,"assembly elections,BJP,Congress,Election,Election campaign,INC,Madhya Pradesh,rahul gandhi,Social Media","Congress criteria for selecting candidates for election: 15,000 likes on FB, 5,000 followers on Twitter",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/congress-criteria-for-selecting-candidates-for-election-15000-likes-on-fb-5000-followers-on-twitter/
619,Abhishek Tandon,"It’s that time of the year again when student leaders across the university try to woo the students to elect them as their leaders. The dynamics of students’ politics has changed a lot over the last a couple of decades in DUSU elections as narrated by students and people who have seen this election over the years. A group of students feel that DUSU elections are all about people who want to get into mainstream politics, money, muscle power and is infected by caste combinations. There’s another group of students who feel that DUSU elections is a great platform to understand the value of their vote and get a glimpse of how the world’s biggest democracy operates. When I finally made up my mind to pen down my thoughts on DUSU elections, having witnessed them myself over last 14 years, I was surrounded by a dilemma, whether to be unbiased towards both the ideologies but having interacted with some students myself changed my opinion to focus on the former than on the latter. As a member of the prestigious Delhi University, for almost fifteen years, in different responsibilities, it is important for me to help students and other stakeholders understand how we ourselves are responsible for whatever we observed in the DUSU polls year on year. My goal to write today is to be able to answer all the apprehensions which surround the students and teachers about DUSU. One can assume that people who contest in DUSU elections or college elections are future leaders and or at least aspire to be leaders in their lives. One should, however, not have a myopic vision to envisage these students getting into mainstream politics, only. DUSU leaders, as I like to call them, have been and will continue to be successful journalists, academicians, for everyone has a different understanding of leadership. Having said that, it stays a harsh reality that our country really has a dearth of effective leaders. However, there is no shortage of leaders in the country. DUSU and other University elections have given great leaders to the country, thus making it of great significance. Mr Arun Jaitley, Mr Ajay Makkan, Mr Vijay Goel, Mr Vijender Gupta are a few to mention. Recently nominated to Rajya Sabha by President of India, Mr Rakesh Sinha also contested for DUSU president in 1986. The list of successful entrepreneurs, journos and academicians is very long. Mr Rajat Sharma, Mr Ashok Tandon and Mr Shriram Khanna are to name few. DUSU, as a platform is a great opportunity not only for students who are contesting the elections but also for other students to show and develop their leadership skills by following the elections closely and motivating their peers to come out and vote in larger number. A large section of students do not participate or take a keen interest in DUSU elections because they feel that the entire election is polluted by money, muscle power and caste. Students who have good leadership skills tend to get pessimistic because of the aforementioned reasons and mostly don’t get support from their parents and teachers. Political Stalwarts, University representatives and think tanks are now focusing more on a leadership vacuum in India than at leadership at a global level. Any vacuum needs to be filled up sooner or later. The only question is who fills it and how soon? It is a harsh reality that DUSU elections are now dominated by various caste factors and majorly these combinations are proving palmy for almost all the students’ organizations. But for this dominance of caste politics in university, students are equally responsible as much as the student organizations.  In Vivekananda’s point of view, leadership is a work of responsibility, it is a duty. Unfortunately, most often, we have failed to be a leader and don’t fulfil our responsibility of choosing the right leaders. We have not shown enough interest to vote and elect our leader, a leader who can represent us. The poll percentage of DUSU elections is abysmally low and it’s falling every year. Student’s organizations such as ABVP and NSUI which dominate DUSU elections have fielded candidates from all the castes and economic background over the last five decades. But their choice majorly depends on what the student community demands. All these political parties want to win the elections and therefore they tend to support candidates whom the students want to elect. Tomorrow, if students community decide that they want a to elect a leader who has good oration, carries a pleasing personality and is strong in his/her academics, the student organizations will be pushed to support the candidate with required skills. But unfortunately, students at large choose an easy way of turning a blind eye to DUSU elections and hence result is clear in front of us. The youth of this country is making a tremendous contribution towards the development. We have seen almost everyone coming out with their perspective, ideology and thought process on social media. There’s a great sense of satisfaction to see students coming forward to participate in debates, crucial dialogues and decision making. We have improved percentage of voting at State and General elections but we are lacking behind in University elections. DUSU is recording around 40-50 % voting over the past few years. Another aspect which leaves many in a conundrum over DUSU elections is the role of national-level political parties. I feel the presence of the student organizations affiliated with these political parties is important to both strengthen the role of students in building democracy and identification of future leaders. DUSU is a sizable election where candidates have to cover around 50 colleges spread throughout the city. The time of the campaign has also been reduced from ten days earlier to now almost 3-5 days only. Because of the paucity of time, it is almost impossible for candidates to reach out to each and every college and hence it becomes easy for the student’s community to relate their own ideologies with those of the organization which is backing the candidates. DUSU has been led by RSS backed ABVP and Congress backed NSUI. Almost all the students studying in university colleges and departments are aware of the policies and ideology of both the groups at local and national level. Thus, it gets easy for them to elect the candidates on the basis of ideologies and the narrative these national parties are set at centre stage. NOTA has also been introduced in DUSU and votes in NOTA are also increasing. However, to speak from political aspirations the objective with which NOTA was introduced has not been achieved. Students who come unaware about the candidates opt for NOTA. In my view, election officers must think of some innovative steps like a brief introduction of all the candidates on their website or maybe launch a mobile application on DUSU elections, having information on all the candidates. This will help students choose and make a wise decision. I put forward my views today, with a hope that students across different DUSU affiliated colleges will come out in large number and vote in DUSU elections 2018. Participating in elections is very important for our democracy and the future of our country. University, with the help of NSS and other students, should also come out with ideas similar to that of Election Commission to motivate students to participate in the festival of Democracy called DUSU elections. Before I conclude, I would like to quote Nobel laureate, Mr Kailash Satyarthi, “The power of youth is the commonwealth for the entire world. The faces of young people are the faces of our past, our present and our future. No segment in the society can match with the power, idealism, enthusiasm and courage of the young people.” For, the youth needs direction; they can change the world and what better way to begin than to understand the power of their vote, the power to change who leads them, the power to empower!",2018-09-04,"abvp,BJP,campus,College Politics,Congress,Delhi University,DUSU,Election,Election campaign,NSUI,Politics",Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) Elections: A Festival of Democracy,https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/delhi-university-students-union-dusu-elections-a-festival-of-democracy/
620,Raju Das,"As Madhya Pradesh assembly elections come closer, Congress party is increasing its soft-Hindutva approach. After Madhya Pradesh Congress President promised  that they will they will build Gaushalas in every panchayat of the state, another comment from a party leader to appease the ‘majority community’ has come forward. According to a video accesses by Republic  TV, Congress party media in-charge and key Rahul Gandhi-aide Randeep Singh Surjewala played the ‘Brahmin’ card at an event of the ‘Brahmin Samaj’ at Haryana’s Kurukshetra on Monday. At the event, he claimed that Congress party has ‘Brahmin DNA’. He then adds that there is Brahmin Samaj’s DNA within the Congress. He is quoted as saying, He also says that Rahul Gandhi embarked on the Yatra of Bhole Nath alone (referring to the Congress president undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra). Surjewala went on to compare Rahul Gandhi with Gods and BJP leaders with Demons, referring the Gandhi family scion as a ‘Shiv-bhakt’ (devotee of Lord Shiva). ‘The fight between Gods and Demons has been happening since time immemorial. In Mythology, whenever Vishwamitra sat for prayers, demons would try to foil it. Whenever anyone prayed for Bhole Shankar (Lord Shiva) demons would gather to foil it. Even today, Shiv-bhakt, your son, Congress chief and our leader Rahul Gandhi is on his way to Bhole Shankar’s Yatra to Kailash Mansarovar. And who’s trying to foil his trip? Leaders of the BJP’. The statements of Surjewala is interesting in the context of the fluid position that Congress has taken on religion. Most times it tries to project itself as messiah of minorities, with its then PM Manmohan Singh declaring  that minorities have the first right over resources and allegations of Rahul Gandhi asserting that Congress is a party of Muslims, but during election times it turns to the other side of the spectrum, from Temple Run  by Rahul Gandhi before Gujarat elections to he being declared  a ‘Janeu dhari Brahim’ by his party leaders to he undertaking the Man Sarobar Yatra. It is also intriguing that Congress’ claims of being a Brahmin party come weeks after BJP had questioned Rahul about Congress reportedly being called a “Muslim party”  at a meeting between Muslim intellectuals and Rahul Gandhi. They had also questioned whether Congress coined the term Hindu Terror just to position themselves as a Muslim party.",2018-09-04,"2018 Assembly Elections,brahmin,Congress,INC,Janeu Dhari,Janeudhari Shiv Bhakt,Madhya Pradesh,rahul gandhi,Randeep Surjewala,Soft Hindutva,sonia gandhi","‘Congress has Brahmin DNA’ says Randeep Surjewala, likens Rahul Gandhi to ‘God’ and BJP to ‘devil’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/congress-has-brahmin-dna-says-randeep-surjewala-likens-rahul-gandhi-to-god-and-bjp-to-devil/

Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief even said  that they will announce the list of 105 candidates for the elections that may soon be announced for the formation of new government. Daring the Congress to come and fight elections on the ground, KC Rao said  that Telangana is now free of issues like bomb blasts, electricity shortage and communal violence which plagued the newly formed state. But it is now free of all this. Referring to Rahul Gandhi as ‘buffoon’, he mocked Rahul Gandhi’s ‘hug-and-wink ‘ drama from the floor test held in July.

622,Abhishek Banerjee,"Fuel prices are hurting. Petrol prices have broken Rs 85/ litre in several cities. Is this supposed to be  Of course not. Well, how could it be? We all like to splurge and then we hate it when the bill comes due. Except, in this case, it is not us who splurged, it was our overlords in the UPA government who did and left us stuck with the bill. Well, why won’t the government just cut the fuel prices? If you are asking this, you probably do not know the kind of deep well that UPA dug for us before they left office. When global oil prices rose in 2012, 2013 and 2014, the UPA’s reputation, along with India’s economy, was already collapsing. If public anger had been stoked any further by surging oil prices, the Congress might have been reduced to single digits in 2014. The ruling dispensation had already scammed pretty much everything available on land, air, sea and even in space. There was only one thing left to do. They could scam us out of our future earnings. So how did the UPA lower oil prices? Instead of paying Oil Manufacturing Companies (OMCs) in cash, the government started ‘paying’ them in ‘oil bonds’. An ‘oil bond’ is not money, it’s just a promise that the government will pay them in the future, preferably under a different ruling party that will be left to bear the brunt. Think of it as the UPA paying for oil with a post-dated check. Only worse, because when you issue a bond, you also have to pay interest on it. So it is more like a credit card. By the time Modi Sarkar came to power, the UPA had already swiped its credit card to borrow a whopping Rs 1.3 lakh crore worth of oil. In the last four years, the Modi government has had to pay back UPA’s debt in full along with Rs 70,000 crore in interest. While Modi has been paying UPA’s credit card bill, the Congress Party has been on the streets asking: why won’t PM Modi cut oil prices? Is this Achche Din? Think of it as a father who mortgages the ancestral home to pay for his gambling habit and then runs away one day, leaving his sons and daughters to pay back the loan. Only worse, because once those sons and daughters have worked hard and repaid the loan, the father comes back and asserts his right to ownership of that ancestral home.

623,Abhishek Banerjee,"She had been fasting for days. She was a 52-year-old woman. It was midnight. She was asleep, stretched out on the ground. The Delhi police arrived at the Ramlila Maidan where Baba Ramdev and his followers were holding a protest. The same Delhi police that answers to the Ministry of Home Affairs, then under UPA in 2011. And possibly to the extra-constitutional National Advisory Council, headed by Madam Sonia Gandhi. They rained blows on her. With thick lathis, they hit her again and again, breaking and dislocating her spinal column in multiple places. She did not die immediately. Instead, she was put on constant ventilator support. She suffered nearly four full months before finally succumbing  to her injuries in late September of 2011. The government’s excuse? The permit was for a Yoga camp, not a Satyagraha. For this, Rajbala Devi paid with her life. Truth be told, I don’t know much more about Rajbala Devi. The media never cared to tell us anything about her. That night when they came for her, there were actually hundreds of television crews watching. But nobody was interested in telling us her story. Who was she? What were her hopes and dreams in life that were squelched that night under the jackboots of the UPA government as she was beaten to a pulp? Nobody knows. The prima facie evidence suggests that she was not a leftist and so it hardly matters what happened to her. These days, we hear a lot about “dissent” and the price that leftists are allegedly paying for it. Some have had to spend a few hours in police custody. Some are facing “arrest” within the confines and comforts of their lavish properties in Delhi and Mumbai. Everything they do qualifies as “dissent”. And it is not just ordinary dissent, it is all brave and heroic; paeans are sung to their greatness and nobility. Apparently, one of them was born in America but decided to move to India. How dare we arrest her? A convicted terrorist who has served time in jail after getting arrested in connection to the recovery of nine detonators and twenty gelatin sticks? Legitimate dissenter. Raising provocative slogans in an airplane is the obvious equivalent of shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theatre? Legitimate dissent as well. Meanwhile, the left-liberal elite laughs off the death of Rajbala Devi. They say we shouldn’t do “whataboutism.” They say we should focus instead on the left-liberal “dissenter” who wakes up in the morning to find her timeline crowded with angry tweets. Rajbala Devi woke up to find lathis raining down on her spine. And then she never woke up again. But so what? Who cares? There are so many like her that I could tell you about. Their bodies are strewn all across time. There is Trilochan Mahato, the BJP worker who was found hanging from a tree in West Bengal. He was just a boy. They even wrote on his shirt: “Killed for doing BJP politics.” Who cares? Trilochan was just a BJP worker, that too a tribal. His death is not as big news as the arrest of some “tribal rights activist” who may have come from the big city, maybe even from America. Trilochan was from a modest family in a tribal district. That too he was doing the politics of BJP, probably not realizing how thankful tribal people should be to have “tribal rights activists” visiting them. Let him die. It’s his fate, right? Some bodies of BJP workers are found hanging from electric poles. Some bodies of BJP workers with their hands tied together are fished out of ponds. These people don’t matter one bit. I remember a case from Tripura where a woman who dared to quit the CPI(M) was tortured, gang-raped and blinded in one eye. The incident is fresh in my memory because it was reported in a major newspaper only recently, almost two years after it happened. Because her dissent was not cool and hip of the Press Club of India variety and so it took two years before it was reported. Her dissent did not trend on Twitter. They say that talking about her might invite the sin of “whataboutism.” Do you know the name of a single person who perished in S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express near Godhra junction on Feb 27, 2002? Don’t answer that. Last night, I happened to catch snippets of the primetime show of a celebrity journalist. He seemed quite incensed about the “fascism” of people getting arrested for raising slogans in planes. Because airport security and DGCA rules don’t matter any more in a post 9/11 world. Only “dissent” does. It reminded me of an earlier time when the same journalist lunged at somebody on the open street because they were heckling him. It reminded me of a few months ago when people were reportedly interrogated by police for screaming at him while he was in a restaurant. It was reported that the accused in question were let off with a warning. I wonder what was in that police warning. Do not exercise your free speech rights within 20 feet radius of a celebrity journalist, which increases to 50 feet if the journalist in question is also a Goud Saraswat Brahmin? I watched bits of his primetime show. I felt his views on dissent have evolved between then and now. Call me crazy, but it appears to me that we have two classes of people in this country now. The slightest inconvenience to people of one ideological bent is considered a national tragedy. As for people of the other ideology, they can be deprived of life and liberty at will. An apartheid-like mentality has taken hold in our national discourse. And a civil right like the movement is needed for the emancipation of the underclass.

624,Sanghamitra,"Rahul Gandhi is on a multi-nation tour to Europe. In London, he spoke at the International Institute of Strategic Studies over a number of issues. The Doklam standoff of 2017  has been one of the constant issues over which Rahul Gandhi and his party have been attacking the central government, especially PM Modi and EAM Sushma Swaraj. Over the months, there have been many debates and noise in the parliament and many speeches and statements. At IISS too, Rahul mentioned the Doklam standoff between India and China and stated how PM Modi had ‘failed’. At a crucial point, when asked how he could have handled the Doklam issue differently, Rahul, surprisingly, stated that he does not have any details on the Doklam issues and he cannot answer how he could have handled the issue differently. Clearly, for the President of the main opposition party who has been attacking the government over that specific issue relentlessly on national and now international platforms, this was a major embarrassment. At that point, for any careful observers, Rahul Gandhi ought to have had lost all the credibility to question the government ever again on the Doklam issue. Sadly, a major chunk of Indian media chose to ignore and even omit it. NDTV, on its report of the event, Titled  Its headline too aims to obfuscate the basic fact that the Doklam is a large plateau and the Chinese are constantly present ‘on their own territory’ . As explained here, China’s presence in that area was never an issue as long as they remained in their territory. The Doklam standoff was about the change in status quo  which has since been established again after India’s tough stand. Somehow, Rahul Gandhi and some news outlets never bother to mention the fact. The NDTV report has carefully chosen to totally omit the part where Rahul Gandhi said he had ‘no details’ on Doklam and he cannot say how he could have handled the issue differently. Sadly, NDTV was not alone in such ‘selective’ reporting. The Deccan Chronicle report of the event dated August 24, also has no mention of the fact that Rahul had ‘no details’ of Doklam. In fact, the report started detailing his statements ‘after’ that portion where Rahul diverted the question and started speaking about Doklam not being an ‘episode’ but a part in the sequence of events. As if omitting the pivotal part of Rahul’s talk was not enough, leftist propaganda website The Quint went a step ahead and made a fancy video  of Rahul’s statements at the London event. In that video, they even carefully edited the part where Rahul says he has no details of Doklam and made their report about Rahul’s statements where he criticises PM Modi’s ‘handling’ of the issue and where he equates RSS with Muslim Brotherhood. The irony of a PM hopeful expressing his utter ignorance over the very issue over which he has been attacking the government and then going ahead to criticise PM Modi over the same issue is not lost on anyone, but unfortunately for certain media outlets, the glaring irony holds no importance over propaganda peddling. The report  on Outlook was no different. It stated that Rahul Gandhi has ‘come down heavily’ on PM Modi over the Doklam issue but had no mention of the ‘no details’ part. The fact is, going by Rahul Gandhi’s incessant attempts to corner the central government over the Doklam issues and his activities during and after the standoff period, he had projected a picture of himself as a person who has a great insight over the issue. As mentioned by the report  in The Times Of India, Rahul Gandhi is a member of the Parliamentary Committee on external affairs which had examined the situation of the military standoff between India and China last year. In fact, as per reports, Rahul Gandhi had been the member with the maximum number of queries when the parliamentary standing committee was briefed  by the then foreign secretary S, Jaishankar. It was a meeting over India China relations with a focus on the Doklam standoff. In February this year, the parliamentary panel was again briefed by the external affairs ministry and the panel had even called former Army Chief Deepak Kapoor , former ambassador to China Nalin Surie and other defence experts. If after all these meetings and briefings Rahul still claims he has ‘no details’ of Doklam, it is either a lie or a really big question mark on his credibility as a critique of the central government’s handling of the situation. Over the months Rahul had criticised  PM Modi, the EAM, MoS VK Singh and even the foreign secretary repeatedly over the Doklam issue. He had met the Chinese ambassador during the ongoing standoff. He has even defended his meeting the Chinese ambassador when it was criticised. Earlier this month, the standing committee refrained from adopting the draft report on the Doklam issue because many members, including Rahul Gandhi himself , was not present in the meeting. On August 1, EAM Sushma Swaraj had clarified once more that there has been no change in status quo at Doklam. The fact that Rahul Gandhi is contradicting himself and his admission of the fact that he cannot state how he could have handled the issue differently may not surprise many, for the Congress Prince is known for his goof-ups. But Rahul Gandhi has developed a habit of taking his goof-ups to a global level  and it is unfortunate for the nation that a major portion of India’s media chooses not only to ignore his blunders but goes the extra mile to cover it up with a carefully crafted garnishing of spinning and fake-narrative building.",2018-08-25,"China,Doklam Standoff,EAM Sushma Swaraj,general vk singh,london,media bias,PM Modi,rahul gandhi",Did media outlets deliberately omit the part where Rahul Gandhi displayed his ignorance on Doklam?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/08/did-media-outlets-deliberately-omit-the-part-where-rahul-gandhi-displayed-ignorance-on-doklam/
625,K Bhattacharjee,"Social media was abuzz after Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s latest gaffe in Britain where he compared the Rashtriya Swayamswevak Sangh with the Muslim Brotherhood. Those unaware, the Muslim Brotherhood is a global Islamist Sunni organization that was founded in Egypt. The group which has been labelled a terrorist organization in various countries managed to capture power in Egypt before it was removed from power through a coup and was subjected to a severe crackdown. The history of the Muslim Brotherhood’s close proximity to Jihad and use of violence to achieve its political objectives since its inception in 1928 is well documented. The interesting part, however, is that the group abandoned the use of violence in the 1970s and decided to embrace electoral politics to achieve its objective. When the group did manage to capture political power in 2012 after Mohamed Morsi became Egypt’s first elected President, massive demonstrations broke out following which the military carried out a coup within a year and put him under house arrest. Given this context, it is rather troubling that the leader of India’s largest opposition party is making a comparison between the Muslim Brotherhood and the RSS. It is quite well known that after a long struggle, the RSS finally managed to capture power through its political wing, the BJP when Narendra Modi exceeded all expectations by securing a majority for the party on its own. The Muslim Brotherhood is considered a terrorist organization by countries such as Egypt, Syria, UAE, Saudi Arabia. By comparing a cultural organisation like the RSS with a terrorist organization like the Muslim Brotherhood, is Rahul Gandhi hinting towards a possible crackdown on the organization should the UPA return to power in 2019? The significant efforts of the Congress party to conjure a narrative of Hindu terror is quite well known. It is also known that a senior leader of the Congress party attended the release of a book that blamed the RSS for the 26/11 attacks. Whistle-blowers have revealed  since then that there was pressure from within the ranks of the Congress party to frame Hindus in order to prove their narrative  of Hindu terror. Thus, keeping in mind the track record of the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi’s comparison of the RSS with the Muslim Brotherhood cannot be dismissed as the ramblings of a confused mind. Comparing RSS to ISIS and other terror organizations is nothing new. It is fashionable among people from a certain political background to wax eloquent on how RSS is similar to ISIS. But coming from the President of the Congress party, it’s certainly much more troubling. By demonizing the RSS and comparing it with the Muslim Brotherhood on foreign soil, the Congress President appears to be laying the groundwork for a severe crackdown on the RSS should they ever return to power. Muslim Brotherhood suffered a severe crackdown following the coup for its Islamist activities, the comparison with them appears to suggest that RSS might be subjected to a similar crackdown should the Congress ever return to power. The Congress party has propaganda outlets under its wing which it can use to further the narrative that a crackdown on the RSS is necessary, the same outlets which currently whitewash the murders of RSS and BJP cadres in Bengal and Kerala. Furthermore, by suggesting that the RSS looks to capture power and institutions like the Muslim Brotherhood, it appears that even political leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party might not escape the possible persecution either. Keeping in mind the events that unfolded during the ten years of UPA, the very real possibility of the Hindu terror narrative being resurrected cannot be ignored.",2018-08-26,"anti hindu,Anti Hindu bias,Anti Hindu propaganda,BJP,Congress,Divisive politics,Egypt,INC,India,Islamic Terrorism,Muslim Brotherhood,Politics,rahul gandhi,RSS,saffron terror",Is Rahul Gandhi hinting at a possible crackdown on RSS should the UPA return to power in 2019?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/08/is-rahul-gandhi-hinting-at-a-possible-crackdown-on-rss-should-the-upa-return-to-power-in-2019/
626,Nirwa Mehta,"The other day I was at Khan Market in Delhi where one is bound to spot a celebrity journalist or a celebrity lawyer at any given time. While I couldn’t spot anyone, perhaps they were chilling in a boutique brewery somewhere in New Friends Colony, I spotted my Leftist friend who has blocked me on Facebook after I pointed out in her status update that despite being a communist, it is kind of hypocritic she was still working in a private bank, thereby contributing to ‘crony capitalism’ and chose to commute in her Hyundai Creta instead of taking the metro. It is amusing how people who ‘like to speak the truth’ don’t really like to hear it. My conversation with this friend, let us call her JC, went something like this: JC: Hey, long time! Where have you been? Haven’t heard from you since a while. Me: Yeah, just work. Plus with 2019 coming up, days are getting busier, busting propaganda of the Leftists. JC: What Leftist propaganda, everywhere else there is saffronisation, from schools to universities to government. Even the latest Pondy Lit Fest  is saffronized. I cancelled my bookings at last minute. Me: Why are you opposing the lit fest? JC: It reads more like a shakha than a literary festival. Me: How? Many people present there, like scientist Anand Ranganathan, have been vocal critics  of the RSS  and the BJP  from time to time. And there’s also the feminist icon Kalki Koechlin, who clearly isn’t an RSS supporter. JC: C’mon, you know these people are RSS supporters, and they don’t match the quality of our litfests. It is a waste of money. Me: Ah, ‘your’ litfests, eh? so it’s us vs them? JC: Don’t twist my words. I said it’s a waste of money. It is government funded. Me: But your friends are not raising an issue with that. Their contention and problem is because it’s ‘saffron’. Hence they want to cancel it. JC: Yes, that’s dangerous. Me: What about your commitment to free speech then? JC: Free speech can’t be given to ppl who themselves don’t believe in it. If we allow propagation of speech that believes silencing voices, one day we will have not free speech. Me: Don’t you think that sounds kind of meta, since it’s  JC: C’mon, we are fighting  Me: Okay, so you say one must not be allowed to propagate a belief if that particular belief ends up eliminating an environment that enables propagation of numerous or plural beliefs? JC: Hallelujah! Finally you get it. Me: Then communism should be banned in a democracy no? Because if communism prevails, there is no democracy? JC: Again you are twisting my words. Also, I’m not a communist, so if you think this hurts me, try better. Me: But the last time I called you one, you were hurt enough to block me on all communication platforms. Clearly it hurt you enough that time. Okay, what about banning Islam in a secular democracy. Because once Islam prevails, it doesn’t allow propagation of other religions? JC: You are such an Islamophobe. You hate Muslims just like your leader hates them. Me: But why are you hurt? Are you a ‘saffronphobe’ if you are not going to a litfest because people speaking there, according to you, have ‘saffron’ ideology? JC: You know what, I’ll catch up with you later. And before I could ask her how she plans to catch up with me, she was gone. Guess I won’t be spotting her at Khan Market for a few months.

It would be too simplistic and naive to just blame this to overall global warming as the level and scale of destruction in Kerala shows that there is more to it. Now let us analyse this a little further. Reports indicate that 2 committees which submitted reports to the Government in 2011 to protect the Western Ghats. These 2 reports are the Gadgil Report and Kasturirangan Report. Now, what are the details of this Gadgil Report  and Kasturirangan Report (GR and KR)? The Gadgil  and Kasturirangan committees were formed because of pressure from people on the UPA-II government, to save the ecological damage being caused by human activities in the Western Ghats.

This was needed to prevent indiscriminate industrialisation, mining and unregulated development. The Gadgil report wanted the entire Ghats area of 63000 Sq. Km to be declared as an ecologically sensitive area whereas the Kasturirangan committee wanted to declare about 19000 Sq. Km as ecologically sensitive. The Gadgil report was tabled to the Ministry of Environment and Forests on 11th August 2011, when the UPA– II headed by Sonia Gandhi led Congress was in power. This report suggested to make huge changes in classifying areas in Kerala as ecologically sensitive and that allowing any further building of dams, huge constructions etc specifically in  So how are the warning and recommendations from these two reports related to current flooding and disaster in Kerala?

Noted lyricist and poet seem to be in the habit of picking fights with commoners and in the process, insulting them for merely having a different point of view. Yesterday too, when Twitter user Ankit Jain reminded him that he had called for a female cop to be dismissed from her job because she had written a poem that he did not like, Javed Akhtar lost his cool and lashed out at Jain. Ankit Jain was attempting to make a point about how hooligans desecrating memorials of martyrs and creating havoc were absolved of any guilt while lakhs of Kanwariyas are being branded hooligans due to some stray incidents. Akhtar, attempting to justify his call for her dismissal, claimed he did so because one line of her poem was taken from his song. Akhtar then went ahead to justify his stand against the female cop further, stating that she was inciting violence through her poetry. Jain reminded  him that she was not and she was only calling out those who put Islam over India and indulge in anti-India activities. On Jain’s reply that calling out Islamists and hate India brigade is not communalism, Akhtar went on to state that Jain deserves his contempt because he is ‘petty and devoid of introspection’. What transpired next was nothing short of bizarre. Javen Akhtar went on to talk about Ankit Jain’s “type”. Called “his type” hypocrites and cowards. Jain’s “type” however, was not clarified by Akhtar. Akhtar then accused Jain and ‘his gang’ did of not raising the slogan of Bharat Mata Ki Jai before the British and they were ‘collaborators like Muslim League’. Javed Akhtar’s hypocrisy and attempt to attack Ankit was called out by other Twitter users. Javed Akhtar has had Twitter meltdowns before too. Ironically he tried to justify his rage against a female cop or using one line from his song, but had gone on a Twitter rampage when earlier some Twitter users had tried to point out to him that his movie Sholay  was almost entirely lifted out of Hollywood movie plots. Javed Akhtar has in the past been called out for being a radicalism apologist , Rohingya terrorist sympathiser  and he had even defended Triple Talaq . He had also abused people  and has mocked legendary sportspersons as ‘hardly literate’ , just because they had a different opinion than him. Javed Akhtar or his fans can justify his petulant behaviour saying that he was provoked and angered and thus gave it back in the same coin. If that be the case, then why should he find fault with a cop for merely expressing in words after being angered by what happened at Azad Maidan.

629,Ashish Shukla,"Mani Shankar Aiyar’s re-induction in Congress is a disturbing news from multi-perspectives. The act was bad, the timing was bad and the case against Congress as speaking for our hostile neighbours is now an iron-clad one. Aiyar was suspended last December for calling Narendra Modi a “neech aadmi ” during the Gujarat elections. The language was abusive and the Congress feared a backlash from the backward community in an election it wanted to win at all costs. Now the man has been brought back into the fold by Rahul Gandhi and no explanation has been forthcoming from the Congress. The least the party could’ve done is to spell out why Aiyar’s misdemeanour no longer embarrasses them. The timing of Aiyar’s re-induction was bad too for Congress is facing great flak on account of one of its ministers in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu, acting a buffoon  on his visit to Islamabad during Prime Minister Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony recently. Aiyar, in the past, has professed his love for Pakistan  in no uncertain terms and his re-induction, while Sidhu is facing the nation’s ire, is quite insensitive on Congress’ part. It was Aiyar who had arranged a dinner between former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, vice-president Hamid Ansari, a retired chief of army staff and a Pakistani delegation during the Gujarat elections. That Congress first chose to deny  the meeting and then wilt under the incontrovertible evidence carries a tale of its own.  The WikiLeaks informs us that Rahul Gandhi had told the US ambassador he was more worried about “saffron terror ” than Pakistani terrorists! At once, it’s a reflection on visceral hatred for rightwingers; and a soft spot for rogue Pakistan. It does put Congress commitment to nationalism under the lens, forget the hurt it causes to our soldiers who identify Pakistan as the source of violence and terrorism in Kashmir Valley which has cost thousands of their own brethren and India its’ brave men. From Rahul Gandhi visiting the Chinese ambassador during the Doklam stand-off; Manmohan Singh releasing a former Pakistan General’s book; Digvijay Singh going public with his “India-occupied-Kashmir ” remark; Farooq Abdullah claiming  India cannot take back Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir” and now with this cover of protection to Sidhu and Aiyar, Congress looks happy in the company of our enemies and that’s a cause for distress. And to think how Congress had moved heavens when former President Pranab Mukherjee had decided to visit RSS headquarters earlier this year. A legally-administered mass-based social institution was vilified worse than a Congress would ever do to Hafiz Saeed and his dreaded terrorist outfit, Lashkar-e-Taiba. Indeed, whether Congress likes Pakistan or not is no longer even a question. The real query is why a set of politicians are willing to go against the national sentiment and show bonhomie towards Pakistan? Why Lutyens Media appear an accomplice to this “aman brigade” in complete disregard to facts and nation’s security?

630,Vijaya Dar,"I begin this piece with a quote from the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset, who wrote in “The Revolt of the Masses” that was published in 1929, that  When the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the other so-called spokespersons of the Congress keep repeating the mantra that Rahul Gandhi has “outstanding credentials to be nominated” as the Prime Minister of India, it validates Ortega’s observation about the commonplace mind trying to impose a mediocre soul on the country. What are these outstanding credentials that are being touted by the Congress leaders? Apart from him being born in the Family with its appurtenances of abundant wealth and privilege; as also the fortuitous circumstance of a respected surname, Rahul Gandhi “partially” typifies Ortega’s mass man who “is the self-satisfied specialist in a post-industrial society who knows expertly his own corner of the universe but is ignorant of the rest: a ‘learned ignoramus.’ The mass man is interested in automobiles, anaesthetics, and all manner of sundries. And these things confirm his profound lack of interest in civilization itself. For all these things are merely products of civilization and the passion he displays for them makes more crudely obvious his insensibility to the principles which made them possible. Why “partially?” – because he does not qualify to be called an expert knower of the corner of his own universe. The Congress has only two power centres – and he happens to be one of them. Yet, he comes up, at metronomic regularity, with absurdities that confirm his profound lack of knowledge about anything. Be it the latest allegation against the Modi government on the Rafale deal with Dassault in France, or the ridiculous question as to why BHEL was not commissioned to manufacture mobile phones and wanting to see Barack Obama’s bed-sheet marked Made in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi displays complete insensibility to that corner of the universe to which he apparently belongs. He fails even by Ortega’s definition of “a learned ignoramus.” The BHEL absurdity is so beautifully captured in the accompanying tweets . Rahul Gandhi does not know what he is expected to do. It seems he is much more comfortable in the role of a vigilante, one of those comic-book side-kicks, who suddenly appear on a scene, perform their acts, and vanish into thin air. Whenever some responsibility, like leading the election campaign in a state, has been assigned to him, he has inevitably come a cropper. His academic credentials remain shrouded in mystery and controversy. When Manmohan Singh was appointed as the Prime Minister, a series of e-mails was doing the round of the web highlighting his academic qualifications, calling him the highest qualified Prime Minister in the world. It is a different matter that this highly educated and vastly experienced bureaucrat presided over the most brazenly corrupt and inefficient government in the history of independent India. But, at least, he had a resume that could impress leaders of the international community who would find it hard to deny him an audience. On matters relating to the economy, he would be familiar with all the terminology and jargon that passes for high thinking. Rahul Gandhi, I am afraid, would find it hard to explain the difference between fiscal and revenue deficits. The shrill Indian media continuously barrages and harangues Narendra Modi and the BJP to explain their visions for the future, deriding them on Gau-Rakhsha or Swachh Bharat, Digital India, Make in India, and every other scheme that the Government announces for bringing some equity in the lives of the common people. Modi has not given them the free rides that they had become accustomed to with Manmohan Singh. English language TV channels and newspapers are especially virulent in their unveiled hatred for Modi. Some discredited celebrities have found channels for venting their spleen abroad in such papers as Washington Post and New York Times, in a post-Obama era. These newspapers are equally opposed to both Donald Trump and Modi. Every two-bit anchor feels supremely entitled to roar his or her questions at Modi and the BJP, but when it comes to asking a question of Rahul Gandhi they behave like mice in a biologist’s laboratory. And when it comes to having an audience with the Divine Mother herself, like what happened to Aroon Purie at the India Today conclave, they just curl up and die. This tribe of obnoxious and supremely opinionated news anchors has questions of all and sundry, in pompously named programs like “left, right, and centre but has no questions for Rahul Gandhi. The electronic media today is increasingly adopting the aspirations of the mob. The mob-like the TV camera has no historical memory – it considers only what is within its immediate field of vision, not the complicating facts beyond it. The Economist, in a leading article  in its 14th December 2013 publication headlined “Would Modi save India or wreck it?” wanted “an unambiguous public demonstration that he abhors violence and discrimination against Muslims” as “a bare minimum.” “Otherwise,” the author had the audacity to add, “This newspaper will not back him.” Nowhere have I read that Narendra Modi had requested The Economist to endorse him for the Prime Minister’s post at any time. One does not have to look too far to see how Rahul Gandhi would perform if he were to become the PM of the country. Just look at the state of Uttar Pradesh, where another scion of a political dynasty had been the Chief Minister for full five years before the people sent him packing rather unceremoniously. Both Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav come from almost similarly privileged backgrounds, appear to have similar intellectual capabilities, and have lived lives that require no effort. The British novelist John Fowles, in his book of essays titled “Wormholes” wrote, “A life of entertainment and convenience produces ever-shallower leaders. Nor are such leaders well advised. Such shallow and childlike leaders and advisors would, by the very virtue of their lack of wisdom and experience, eventually commit the kind of ghastly miscalculation that would lead to a general catastrophe of some kind.” Countries with young populations are subject to political violence. Third World populations growing dramatically and becoming increasingly urbanized, leaders have to become increasingly ingenious in resolving crises that are inevitable due to an ever-increasing demand for basic necessities, jobs and services. They have to have the ability to negotiate with an increasingly complex web of international corporations and markets that are becoming the real arbiters of power in the current world. Jeffrey Sachs, the well-known professor of international trade writes “good government means relative safety from corruption, from breach of contract, from property expropriation, and from bureaucratic inefficiency.” The UPA government, led by the “highest qualified Prime Minister in the World” failed in all the above criteria. What are those “outstanding credentials” that people like Manmohan Singh, Shashi Tharoor, and the rest of the rump that passes for leadership in the Congress party, see in Rahul Gandhi that are, until now, completely hidden from our view? Arthur Koestler writes, “To create innocence, one must have awareness of guilt.” But when the Congress continues to behave without any awareness of guilt, how does it expect to create innocence for its assumed leader? A captive print and electronic media, a compromised academia, and a plethora of foreign-funded NGO’s that have the mandate to “Break India” along the various fault lines that they think are vulnerable, have taken it upon themselves to prop up this shadow warrior, better expressed as “Kagemusha” by the Japanese, to face the challenge of Narendra Modi and the so-called right wing. I am reminded of Erasmus who had accused the academic mediocracy of “looking in utter darkness for that, which has no existence whatsoever.” Arthur Koestler, in a paper titled “The Poverty of Psychology” published in 1961, wrote, “The rearguard is still firmly entrenched in university chairs, the editorial offices of technical papers, and other positions of power. In the period of scholastic decline, the orthodox Aristotelians had occupied similar key positions…. ‘They are Folly’s servants,’ declared Erasmus, denouncing the sterile pedantry and grotesque academic jargon of his time.” One wonders how he would react today to the definition of the mediocracy that has taken over most of the “free” academic world. Robert D. Kaplan”s succinct statement that “avoiding tragedy requires a sense of it, which in turn requires a sense of history” encapsulates the tragedy of the Congress party that has got itself trapped in a time warp where the beginning and the end of everything is contained in the Gandhi surname.

What is he doing so miraculous in the nation that people are in an awe of him? Only to realise later that he was no less than a superhero for India when I took my first metro ride in Delhi. Yes, metro train in our very own country which all of sudden changed the outlook of the country from a poor nation which I used to read in social science textbooks to a prospering nation. As I grew up and happened to pursue economics as my majors in graduation in 2012, I started reading about the economic trajectory that India achieved in the past two decades. That became a moment of political awakening for me and I could connect the dots of all the past discussions that I used to scoff at as a kid. The biggest deprivation that we millennials suffer is of not witnessing the strategic developments revved up by Atal Bihari Vajpayee that transformed the very face of India that we boast of now. This enlightening brouhaha moment made me delve deeper into the recent history of Indian politics. Attempting to read scores of books and articles on the political regime of 1998-2004, I realised that India heralded a new era under the aegis of Shri Atal Bihari. What made me adore his leadership is his well-articulated economic policies that sustained the growth of 6%-8% amidst the chaos of Gulf war, Asian financial crisis, Indo-Pak terror attacks and Dot Com Bubble. He took the nation out from the shackles of dampening and a sluggish economy and provided a sturdy backbone for India’s future endeavours by investing robustly in human development and most notably, “Education for All”.  The Golden Quadrilateral and other National Highways that we are travelling on seamlessly today are all his legacy. Despite these breathtaking developments, the puzzle that why he assumes massive respect of people got solved the day I learnt that he was the first ever India leader to render UN speech in the Hindi language. His words “Quiet diplomacy is more effective than public posturing” still echoes in my head. His pioneering foreign diplomacy with the United States and attempts at resolving the troubles with the West post-cold war era deserve head bows. History is a testimony to the fact by imbibing the slogan of “Insaniyat, Jhamuriyat and Kashmiriyat” for the disturbed valley of Kashmir, he laid the foundation of a new Kashmir. I still doubt if any other leader before and after him could take on the challenge of this stature. He was a leader who was much ahead of his time and dared to lay grounds for nuclear capacity and space technology for future India which would lead India towards the league of the leaders of the world. His dedication towards the service of nation is evident from the fact that despite massive backlash for his nuclear and space program at home and abroad, he shunned his short-sighted political gains for the larger interest of the country, and steadfastly carried on the development whose benefits we are reaping today. All during my teenage I senselessly cribbed for being politically unaware during those times, and obviously, how could a child be! The years that followed 2004 had lost all the enthusiasm and passion that India had built during preceding years. The lull that followed made me more uncomfortable as the robustness in progress of the nation was nowhere to be seen and soul of the country was having a slow demise. There were no more family discussions in praise of India and soon my inquisitiveness dissipated too. The spirit of nation-building and nationalism which was invoked by Atal Ji was all of sudden missing until Narendra Modi took over the reign of the country. The present government proved as a respite and seems like compensating on those good old days. Fortunately, the present government is treading on the footsteps of Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government and we once again got an opportunity to re-live the past days. Atal Ji’s vision of New and Transformed India is meticulously carried forward by Narendra Modi’s government by taking the nation on a fast-track mode as was done back in 1998. I just hope that today’s leadership does complete justice to the sacrifices and foundation laid down twenty years back. India was truly blessed to have a statesman like him, whose tenure is marked as eventful and historic. He redefined Indian secularism, diplomacy and democracy. He was a man of charisma with the deepest understanding of his nation and its pupil as he always said, “India isn’t India if it is not Secular.” In the ending note from a fangirl, I must also admit that he, as a human being and as a leader has left an indelible mark in my life and has been my inspiration to pursue public policy as a career for myself.

633,K Bhattacharjee,"In the wake of the floods in Kerala, Liberals and Communists have displayed their true intentions as they used a tragedy to further their own political agenda. Just as the Christians organizations have been known to proselytize during relief operations after natural calamities, the liberals in India used the floods in Kerala to further their agenda  of diving India along regional lines. Journalists have started sharing articles which were written earlier to sow the seeds of division within the country by peddling the narrative that Southern India is cheated of its rights by the ‘corrupt and communal bigots in North India’. Another article that is being peddled is from 2016 which talks about  ‘The United States of South India’. Some people afflicted with hyper-intellect have also suggested that Maharashtra join this band of Southern states too. People on social media have obviously not taken kindly to this vile attempt to further their hideous agenda in this moment of misery and at a time when the entire country has united to help those affected by the flood in Kerala. However, with due regards for the circumstances, there are a few things that our intellectuals need to be reminded. Firstly, the sort of grand unity between the southern states that is between by armchair intellectuals exists only in the delusions of their own imagination. In the real word, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu cannot solve the water dispute amicably, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana could not even exist together as a single state and had to be divided and a certain section of Karnataka is demanding their own separate state. Therefore, to paint the entire Southern region of the country as a united block against Northern India is wishful and sinister imagination. The ‘Breaking India Forces’, as they are called these days after the term was coined by Rajeev Malhotra, desperately wish for the balkanization of the Indian Union. To make their deepest desire come true, they fill the hearts and minds of people with resentment to the point where they are no longer able to think clearly. And the excuse these forces have come up with is that the Southern states receive disproportionately less funds from the Center for the contribution they make through taxes. The News Minute article , however, takes care to mention that the author does not advocate secession but the entirety of the article only fuels resentment between the two regions of the country. The authors appear to make the argument that it is unfair for the more prosperous South to contribute more towards the development of other regions of India that are not so prosperous. If we accept the logic at face value, then why is it not unfair to Indian citizens across the country to pay for the welfare and rehabilitation of Rohingya refugees who have entered the country illegally, considering it is the same “liberals” who advocate for the settlement of illegals? Carrying the logic forward, the rich might ask why should they pay the government more money direct taxes than the middle class; prosperous families might ask why should they pay for various welfare schemes which are directed towards benefiting the poor and the less fortunate; and so on and so forth. Our intellectuals constantly demonstrate their love for socialism and redistribution of wealth and yet on the occasion when more prosperous southern states pay for the less prosperous other regions of the country, they suddenly begin to find flaws of redistribution. In fact, the Congress was hand in gloves  furthering the North-South divide earlier. The concept of social justice mandates that those more fortunate walk the extra mile so that the less fortunate can have more opportunities to escape the clutches of poverty and illiteracy and various other maladies. It is extremely unfortunate that for liberals, social justice is merely a political gimmick which they are ever willing to abandon for their primary agenda, that is, the disintegration of the Indian union. Interestingly, such propaganda about an imaginary United Southern front against Northern India was never heard when the UPA was in power. It only goes on to show that the ecosystem is more than willing to let India burn if only they could rule over the pieces. In recent times, there also has been a concerted attempt to portray the Southern states as having a culture fundamentally distinct from Northern India which could not be further from the truth. It is well known that Shri Rama is venerated as much in the South as He is in the North and only a fool who has had his buried in the sand for too long would claim any different. More fundamentally, the crux of the culture of Southern India is the same that has spawned the vast array of different cultures in Northern India, that is, the ancient Sanatana Dharma. It has also been portrayed that the ‘anti-caste’ movements in Tamil Nadu have largely rectified the downsides of the caste system when nothing could be further from the truth. Tamil Nadu remains a state that witnesses a high rate of caste-related atrocities committed by dominant OBCs on Dalits and the virulent anti-Brahmin strain of politics that is mainstream in Tamil Nadu is not unknown to any. Southern India is often portrayed as a heaven of some sort and Northern India as hell while the truth is that both regions have their distinct set of problems which they could help each other solve effectively. It is indeed amusing that liberals and intellectuals who claim that they want Hindus and Muslims to coexist peacefully use every device under the power to foment divisions within the Hindu society. While they urge Hindus to coexist peacefully with Muslims and Christians, as they should and we wish as well, they constantly fuel resentment within Hindus along caste, linguistic and ethnic and regional lines to try to ensure that various sections of the Hindu population never coexist peacefully with each other. Irony is indeed embarrassed when the same people who want peace to prevail between India and Pakistan do everything in their power to ensure that various regions of India are not able to coexist in harmony. It is quite obvious at this point that the goal of liberals and intellectuals is neither peace nor coexistence nor social justice, their sole agenda is to continue to hold the country hostage for their personal benefits. They wish to perpetuate the British legacy of ‘Divide and Rule’ so that they continue to rule the roost in the corridors of power. And if the seeds of hatred they sow threaten the disintegration of the Indian Union, they would hardly care as they would continue to prosper financially and otherwise.",2018-08-20,"Divide and Rule,Divisive politics,Kerala Floods,media bias,south india,South Indian states,The News Minute,The Print",Social Justice willingly sacrificed as ‘Divide and Rule’ gains traction among the Intellectual elite,https://www.opindia.com/2018/08/social-justice-willingly-sacrificed-as-divide-and-rule-gains-traction-among-the-intellectual-elite/
634,OpIndia Staff,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s social media presence has been in the news for various reasons. From links with infamous Cambridge Analytica  to using bots for Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter resurgence  to multiple goof-ups , the mainstream media has stood by the Congress  like a rock. Earlier, Congress social media head Divya Spandana, who has been credited for the turnaround, had claimed that Congress President Rahul Gandhi himself manages his Twitter handle. At 19:42, India Today’s Rahul Kanwal had asked Divya who tweets for Rahul Gandhi. Divya had asserted that “Mr Rahul Gandhi tweets for himself,” which, not surprisingly, made the audience erupt into laughter. To reconfirm what Kanwal heard, he again asked Divya whether each of the tweets that are made from the account are the ones Rahul Gandhi puts out himself. To that, Divya again answered in the affirmative. Last evening, journalist and self-proclaimed Nehru fangirl  Sagarika Ghose complimented ‘whoever was handling Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account’ (which of course was Divya Spandana, in Sagarika’s own words). She tweeted that Divya was doing a cracking job. Not surprisingly, Divya hasn’t yet corrected or countered Ghose, who probably knows better owing to her closeness to The Family. Divya’s silence on the subject is surprising considering how vocal she is when it comes to protecting and defending Rahul Gandhi. One wonders then, whether it is really Rahul Gandhi who handles his own Twitter account, or as many suspected, it is indeed Divya and the tales about Rahul’s Twitter resurgence is but a farce.",2018-06-21,"Congress,congress IT cell,divya spandana,rahul gandhi,Sagarika Ghose,Social Media,Twitter",So who really tweets from Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/06/rahul-gandhi-twitter-divya-spandana-sagarika-ghose/

637,K Bhattacharjee,"One of the greatest men of independent India breathed his last on the 16th of August, 2018. Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a giant among mere mortals, was a politician who led India through one of the most critical times in its history to usher in a new era of prosperity. As politicians across the spectrum gathered to mourn the memory of the Hindutva stalwart, it was inevitable that there would be some elements who would try their best to tarnish the solemn moment with their words worthy of much disgust. There was a certain section of the media which was under the impression that it was a good idea to use  the death of Vajpayee to shower more adulation on the Gandhis, the same Vajpayee whose contribution was enormous towards the undermining of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. Then there were those who were rejoicing  at the prospect of Vajpayee’s imminent death and could not hide their hatred for the man even at such an inappropriate moment. Then there were outlets such as The Wire which immediately took it upon itself to pass moral judgments on Vajpayee and brand him a communal bigot. There were much more repulsive posts on the death of Vajpayee which I chose not to quote here but it’s clear that the visceral hatred that those on the Left bear for him is quite out of order. Vajpayee is hated because he is one of the great success stories of Hindutva and is evidence of the fact that a Hindutva Sarkar could provide better governance and lead the country to greater heights than corrupt ‘secular’ parties which indulged in blatant minority appeasement. Vajpayee was the great Hindutvawadi under whose leadership India became a nuclear power and sailed through a period of sanctions without suffering any misery as such. And more importantly, he was a visionary who added new chapters to the Indian growth story which began earlier under the leadership of PV Narasimha Rao. And these are hard pills for the Left to swallow who have demonstrated time and again that their only legacy when it comes to governance is running a state to the ground. The people who are too busy spewing hate against Vajpayee are unsurprisingly the same who believe Aurangzeb was a benevolent ruler and that his persecution of Hindus must be seen from a certain context. The “Liberal” Left hates him for his involvement in the Ram Janambhoomi movement but conveniently chooses to ignore the context under which the vents that transpired developed. A thing that becomes clear after a while is that the Left hates Vajpayee for pretty much the same reasons for which the Right respects and adores him. The Ram Janambhoomi movement, Pokhran, his economic policies and his avowed commitment to Hindutva are what makes Vajpayee so loved among the Right and hated among the Left. And the death of Vajpayee is illuminating once again these irreconcilable differences that have come to the forefront of Indian politics in 2018. The Left betrays its own words with its actions. They preach tolerance and coexistence and rational discussion and yet they do not hesitate to spit on the memory of a former Prime Minister who improved India’s fortunes greatly for the better. They accuse the Right of being filled with hatred and yet, it is they whose minds have been so corrupted with rage that they have forsaken all decency and chosen to spew hatred against a man who hadn’t even been cremated yet. If democratic politics is to succeed, it is essential that certain courtesies are observed by all sides on certain occasions. However, it has become clear that the Left is incapable of observing such common decencies and offer the most minimum of courtesies to a Hindu because they have been consumed by hatred. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a true son of the soil. His speech  on Savarkar is still relevant to this day. We have to remember that Vajpayee isn’t hated for things he did or things he chose not to do. He is hated because of his identity and because he is a Hindutvawadi. The Left has made it abundantly clear that they will reserve nothing but only hatred and scorn for a Hindutvawadi, even in death, ignoring all the greatness that the Hindutvawadi was endowed with. The legacy of Vajpayee is a refutation of the narrative that the Left had carefully crafted over the years that a Sanghi cannot provide effective governance to a 21st century India. The Left describes Hindus as being stuck up over past glories and incapable of charting a bright future ahead and yet it was Vajpayee, the Hindutvawadi, who established India as a nuclear power. The Left would have us believe that Hindu thought is incapable of producing visionary leaders and yet it was Vajpayee, the Hindutvawadi, who envisioned the Golden Quadrilateral and heralded an era of economic prosperity. The Hindutva of Vajpayee was a slap on the face of Nehruvian Socialism and its glories that the Left had come to glorify and that is why he is so reviled even in death. Narendra Modi is only carrying forward the legacy of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He appears to have learnt from the mistakes the late stalwart of Hindutva committed and is working towards fulfilling the dreams and ambition of the now deceased former Prime Minister. Certain sections of the media may now be showering praise on him to further their own political objective of criticizing Narendra Modi but Atal Bihari Vajpayee was hated just as much during his Prime Ministerial tenure as Modi is hated now. At least the section of the political spectrum still showering hate on Vajpayee are consistent with their approach towards the man but worse are the hypocrites who are using his death to attack Narendra Modi, a man after Vajpayee’s own heart. It should be clear to Hindus now that it hardly matters how they conduct themselves in public life. If they believe that the Mughals were tyrants whose symbols of oppression should eradicated from the face of Bharata, if they believe that Babri was a symbol of tyranny and a testament to Islamic intolerance, if they believe that a bhavya Ram Mandir is of utmost import to initiate the spiritual awakening of Bharata and most importantly, if they believe that they have the right to defend themselves from Islamic aggression should the state fail to do so, then they will be hated and reviled by the Left because there’s nothing on the face of the Earth the Left hates more than the unending resilience of the great Hindu Civilization.",2018-08-20,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee,Babri Masjid,BJP,Intolerance,Islamic invaders,Left Liberal,liberal hypocrisy,Narendra Modi,Ram Janmbhoomi,Ram mandir-Babri masjid dispute,Right Wing,security,tribute",Irreconcilable differences: The enduring message that Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s death has left us with,https://www.opindia.com/2018/08/irreconcilable-differences-the-enduring-message-that-atal-bihari-vajpayees-death-has-left-us-with/
638,Abhishek Banerjee,"Shashi Tharoor is a class apart, a member of the political aristocracy. I think that even Shashi Tharoor would agree with that, although he probably would not frame it as an insult. And that he would use a lot of big English words that have fallen by the wayside several hundred years ago. What I mean by the political aristocracy is a class of zamindars who see India as their fiefdom. These people are only nominally attached to any one political party, one ideology, one religion or even one country. Their real aim is to make hay both coming and going. They are the members of the global elite, a group that thrives on other people’s money (OPM) while passing judgement on the same ‘cattle class’ during their high-class sojourns in Geneva, Paris and New York. Earlier on, when the story of Kerala floods had not yet hit the peak of the prime time news cycle, claims of ‘neglect’ became extensive fodder for the Communist Break India trolls. There was some political gravy there and it was not long before Tharoor decided to dig in and get some. That is some serious irony from a man who had described the people of the North East as “hilarious” and “outlandish” only a week or so before that. And a man who belongs to a political party where the top post has been reserved for members of one particular family since time immemorial. And big talk for the Congress Party that packed off the mortal remains of Former PM P V Narasimha Rao to be cremated as far from Delhi as possible. But here is something more interesting. On Aug 16, Shashi tweeted this: Ok. Again, a dig at the Govt of India for (presumably) neglecting Kerala along with the words “We are coping with our own resources.” Here, the word “We” appears to have been used by Shashi for the Govt of Kerala. It is curious that Shashi would do that, considering that his Congress Party is in the opposition in Kerala. What did I tell you about an amoral global elite that will go any side their bread is buttered, a group that owes no allegiance to any party, state, region, religion or country? Anyways, I guess Shashi Tharoor could argue that he used the word “we” in the sense of “we the people.” So let us find out what happened between Aug 16 and Aug 20. What do you know! In four days, Shashi has done a full 180-degree turn and is now in Geneva for “consultations” on Kerala floods. What happened to the Govt of India is the only entity that is authorized to approach the UN? I’ll tell you what happened: So, amid 350 people or so dying in floods in his home state of Kerala, Tharoor has found an excuse to go on a trip to Geneva. This is what happens when we are ruled by an amoral global elite. This is what always happens when Communists take over a state in the name of “serving the people.” The people get left behind while the aristocrats and their cronies enjoy. We all know about Kim Jong Il splurging on fine wines while the people of North Korea were reeling under famine. This is how Communism works. In this case, the people of Kerala are literally drowning as Tharoor’s plane lands at the wonderfully scenic International Airport in Geneva. And what “consultations” is he supposed to hold with the UN and other international human rights agencies? What was the need to go to Geneva? Did these international agencies refuse to return Shashi’s emails, Facebook messages as well as calls on Skype and Whatsapp? A hint for Mr Tharoor: if they are not responding to you on Facebook, Twitter, Skype or Whatsapp, my guess is that they don’t want to talk to you. Or Shashi could just have tried the old-fashioned phone call. The country code for Switzerland is +41. Give it a try Shashi; because it totally works. I would also invite you to examine carefully the language in Shashi’s tweet, where he says he is in Geneva in ‘close consultation’ with Chief Minister’s Office in Kerala. You know what that means? It means that there is a chance that Shashi’s trip to Geneva is being funded by the people of Kerala. And I am guessing that he ain’t travelling ‘cattle class’ nor staying in some youth hostel. No way, those tickets and hotels aren’t coming cheap. Mind you that it’s still peak tourist season in Europe so prices are through the roof for last minute bookings. Shashi Tharoor should clarify who is funding this trip. Is it coming out of personal funds or from the much bankrupt Kerala state treasury? If it is coming out of the state treasury, will they at least have the decency not to take it from the Disaster Relief Fund? Don’t bet on it though, considering how the Kerala CM uses state resources. You have to admit though that Pinarayi Vijayan is a more down to earth Communist, not a man of aristocratic tastes. All he wanted to do was use the state’s Disaster Relief Money for a helicopter ride to a CPI(M) conference in Thrissur. Also, you could argue that the CPI(M) is the greatest disaster to have ever struck the state of Kerala. Meanwhile, the people of Kerala have to get used to the fact that the farther you are from Geneva, the less you matter to aristocrats like Shashi Tharoor.",2018-08-21,"Congress,geneva,Kerala,Kerala Floods,Kofi Annan,Pinarayi Vijayan,Shashi Tharoor,UN","The farther you are from Geneva, the less you matter to Shashi Tharoor",https://www.opindia.com/2018/08/the-farther-you-are-from-geneva-the-less-you-matter-to-shashi-tharoor/

Jokes apart, what exactly does having Imran Khan, the politician, not the ‘legendary cricketer’, as the Prime Minister next door mean? Founding PTI in 1996, in last few years, Imran Khan has shown his soft stand towards terrorism and terrorists in Pakistan. In June 2003, when a US drone strike killed  Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan’s deputy chief Waliur Rehman Mehsud, Khan stirred controversy by referring to him as ‘pro-peace’. Rahman carried  a bounty of USD 5 million on his head and was accused of organising attacks against the US and Nato forces in Afghanistan. He was also wanted in connection with a suicide attack on an American base in Afghanistan in 2009 that killed seven CIA agents. Later, he even suggested  that Pakistani Taliban should be allowed to ‘open an office’ in Pakistan to facilitate peace talks. That’s not all. Imran Khan was also Taliban’s pick  as peace talk mediator with Nawaz Sharif government. In 2002 he had even said  that Taliban’s ‘holy war’ in Afghanistan is justified by Islamic law while visiting the hospital where Malala Yusufzai was treated a week prior. Malala, then a schoolgirl, was shot in the head by the Taliban in Swat valley of Pakistan in October 2012 for writing against the atrocities of Taliban in Swat Valley of Pakistan. Imran Khan has proved time and again that he is a terrorist sympathiser. In the above-undated video, a Pakistani journalist Waseem Badami is asking Khan what his views on Osama Bin Laden, former Al Qaeda chief who was killed by the US in Pakistan’s Abbottabad. First Imran Khan says one who is terrorist for one is a freedom fighter for other. To justify Osama’s terror activities, he cites the example of George Washington and says, for the British, he was a terrorist while a freedom fighter for Americans. When further probed what does he think about Osama, Imran Khan said he would not like to comment on that. Khan has also embraced extreme religious views and promised to uphold  the strict blasphemy laws in Pakistan which mandates the death penalty for any “imputation, insinuation or innuendo” against the prophet Muhammad. In fact, his manifesto also states that he wants to make  Pakistan an Islamic welfare state. Khan’s views on feminism are also every “left-liberal’s” nightmare. He has said  he disagrees with the Western ‘feminist movement’ and that the movement has contributed to ‘degrading’ motherhood. Not just that, Khan has also been accused  of sexual harassment by PTI worker for ‘highly indecent’ conduct and ‘sending objectionable’ messages. His former wife Reham Khan, too, has levelled  accusations of sexual harassment against Khan in her autobiography. As per reports, there are instances of rampant sexual coercion and use of sexual favours within the ranks of PTI, including some directly related to Imran Khan. His former wife Reham Khan has called  out Imran Khan on multiple occasions and called him ‘fake’ and a ‘hypocrite who would do anything to get power’. Even as the Pakistan election are still to be declared, Imran Khan’s PTI seems to be emerging  as a major party, winning 28 out of the 40 seats where results are declared. Meanwhile, the Indian liberals are elated at the prospect of having an Islamist, anti-feminist, terror-sympathiser Prime Minister for the neighbour. Judging by the views held by Imran Khan, at best, he can be termed as ‘clean-shaved Taliban’. It is intriguing that the “liberals” in India have taken such a liking towards Taliban Khan, all the while preaching about how India could turn into  “Hindu Taliban”. It is therefore evident that the “liberals” don’t hate Taliban, they just hate Hindus.",2018-07-26,"blasphemy,feminism,imran khan,islamist,Osama Bin Laden,Pakistan,prophet,taliban,Tehrik-i-Taliban,Terror Sympathisers","Meet the real Imran Khan: The poster boy of Indian ‘liberals’ and almost certainly, Pakistan’s next PM",https://www.opindia.com/2018/07/imran-khan-pakistan-prime-minister-liberal-islamist-anti-feminist-pro-taliban/

However, Twitter users did not take Derek’s threat lying down and decided to pay back in kind. West Bengal has many serious issues plaguing its citizens but their MP apparently seems to be prioritising his time in Parliament discussing Twitter. If Liam Neeson in the movie Taken was inspired by Derek, we would not have bothered to travel to Europe to look for his daughter. Rahul Raj who was earlier defamed  by Derek in Parliament also decided to speak up. It seems every person not adhering to Derek’s views now risks finding his/her name mentioned in the parliament as an abusive troll. Incidentally Derek has been a repeat offender when it comes to misusing his parliamentary privileges. Earlier too, he had defamed private citizens  inside the parliament by alleging that they spread hatred on Twitter. Such a modus oprandi might be a preferred route for him as whatever he alleges there cannot be legally used against him.

Hindi film industry, which prides itself on its secular image, appeared to be taking sides for the first time during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with some Bollywood A-listers asking people to vote “strategically” to protect the country’s secular character. He further recalled  how B-town was split into groups, one supporting PM Modi, of which he and Anupam Kher were a part of and another against Modi, with around 60 celebrities signing an appeal urging the people to protect the country’s ‘secular foundation’ taking an overt anti-Modi stance. Madhur went on to talk about  the controversy encompassing his movie ‘Indu Sarkar’. He said he was disappointed when no one came and backed him on the controversy created over the film. He strongly condemned politicking on movies and creating pressure for banning it. He clearly dismissed the allegation that his movie was funded by BJP government saying that if at all he needed funding it would be for a higher budget movie and not for a low budgeted movie like Indu Sarkar. In 2014, an appeal  from several Bollywood actors, directors and scriptwriters to Indian voters has split the film industry down the middle. Among the sixty film personalities who have signed the letter are Imtiaz Ali, Vishal Bhardwaj, Nandita Das, Govind Nihalani, Saeed Mirza, Zoya Akhtar, Nandita Das, Kabir Khan, Mahesh Bhatt, Shubha Mudgal and Aditi Rao Hydari. Scriptwriter Anjum Rajabali, who drafted the letter had said, “Our sense of India comes from the fact that we are a secular country and if that notion is challenged…if that itself is vulnerable at this moment, that is what has compelled people to speak up. It is the right-wing fundamentalist forces within the BJP that are making young people feel very insecure.” Director Madhur Bhandarkar had then kicked off a debate on the issue on Twitter, asking why a “secular place like Bollywood” is being sought to be divided ” in the garb of stopping so-called divisive forces”. He had come out in support of PM Modi saying it’s “time India got a visionary leader” Amongst others who came forward to support Bhandarkar were Anupam Kher, Tusshar Kapoor, and producer Ashoke Pandit.

He also elucidated the treacherous conditions which Savarkar had to put up with when he was lodged at the infamous “Cellular Jail” in Andaman & Nicobar islands. The leftist establishment which is known to be very hateful towards Savarkar (so much so that they spread blatant lies  to discredit him), didn’t appreciate Sardesai’s views which supposedly resulted in him getting trolled. A few hours after he posted his tweet, Sardesai in a sombre tone claimed how slurs like “bigot”, “chadiwallah” (which are usually reserved for the Right Wing) were hurled at him for his pro-Savarkar view.

It is expected that most of the prominent members close to the party will attend the meet. Rahul Gandhi will be hosting  Iftar party for the first time since he took the charge as the Congress president. The grand Iftar party will be held at Taj Palace Hotel in Delhi, chief of Congress Minority cell chief Nadeem Javed said. Congress has celebrated Iftar party officially when they were in power. The then Prime Minister used to host the grand Iftar party during his tenure. This party is being held after the span of three years, as last time Congress had organized it in 2015, under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi. It is expected that this party will be attended by leaders of all faiths and communities. It is also said that all the leaders of opposition parties will be invited along with the top diplomats. This event organized by Congress party is keenly watched as Congress is trying to woo as many opposition parties to fight against the BJP in the next elections. This comes after the President of India has decided not to celebrate  any religious functions officially in Rastrapathi Bhavan, as it involves spending from the public exchequer. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao decision to host Iftar party has caused a controversy. Activists  have moved to court seeking to stay the celebrations as it involves public money. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also hosted  an Iftar but Congress leaders stayed away from it.

But today, an alleged video, allegedly showing Rahul Gandhi, allegedly at an airport, was seen circulating on social media. There is no way to confirm whether it is Rahul Gandhi, or whether it is a recent video. But my heart says it is Rahul Gandhi because only Rahul ji Gandhi could exhibit the following features, as he has done in the video: a. Note his attire. It is the same designer  Burberry jacket which costs around Rs 70000, which we had last seen him with during his Meghalaya campaign. Rahul ji had told us that it was a borrowed jacket. See the simplicity of the man, he is continuing to keep and use, a borrowed jacket for over 6 months now. No matter that 3-4 out of those 6 months were summer months when such jackets would be useless. He still did not return it to his friend who had lent it to him. This shows that Rahulji doesn’t abandon things, unlike Modi. b. Note his unkempt look. A shabby salt and pepper beard. Rahulji clearly believes in the maxim of “simple living, HIGH thinking”. Hence he has not shaved for many days. Another reason could be the fact that blades are not allowed as hand baggage and Rahul ji does not want to carry luggage which will unnecessarily add to the weight of the plane. c. Rahul ji is cool and calm among the people surrounding him. He has not orchestrated a fake mob (like Modiji) thronging him and asking selfies and autographs. Rahul ji respects the fact that people have their own lives hence he has not turned on his magnetic personality. He has ensured that people can live their lives normally, although he is around. d. Rahul ji told us that he is accompanying Sonia ji for her checkup. But no Sonia ji can be seen in the video. Why? Don’t you know? Don’t you remember Rahul ji’s most epic interview with Arnab? WOMAN EMPOWERMENT! Rahul ji believes that his mother is an independent free-spirited woman who does not need the crutches of a patriarchal son. Much wow, very amaze. e. Rahul ji is seen sans security cover as well. No SPG no bodyguards? Because Rahul ji is not insecure (unlike Modi). Rahul ji knows very well that nothing can harm him and his politics since politics is in his pants which he kept in a drawer yesterday morning when he woke up at night. f. Lastly, Rahul ji has shown that he has no fear. Just recently Rahul ji had faced a failed sabotage attempt when Sanghis had tried to crash his plane in Karnataka. Any ordinary person would have developed a fear of flying. But Rahul ji shows no such irrational fear, and is ready to board plane after plane.

651,OpIndia Staff,"The Election Commission after a preliminary inquiry into the Congress’s allegation of large-scale errors in Madhya Pradesh voter’s list, has clarified  that there are no discrepancies in the voters’ list. The EC said  that the field verification showed that the charges made by the Congress were not true. The Congress party had appealed  to the Election Commission on June 3 seeking its intervention. The party also had alleged that BJP had deliberately registered 60 lakh fake names. It also submitted evidence to back its allegation. The allegations levelled by Congress and its leader Jyotiraditya Scindia were widely discussed and aspersions were cast on the Election Commission and also the BJP. In a letter to AICC, the poll body said, “The allegations of large-scale entries of multiple voters in these assembly constituencies are not borne out”. It said image repetition found was “not related to multiple entries”. “We have provided evidence to the Election Commission that there are approximately 60 lakh fake voters registered in the voting list. These are not merely mistakes. The lists have been deliberately altered at the behest of the BJP government in the state,” Congress leader Kamal Nath said. The EC immediately set up four teams to visit the Assembly seats of Narela, Bhojpur, Hoshangabad and Seoni-Malwa to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegation. The four teams submitted  their report to the Commission on Thursday. In Seoni Malwa, of the 2,442 entries that Congress alleged were similar across polling stations in the same seat, 2,397 were found to be genuine voters. The remaining 45 are being deleted for reasons such as the voter having shifted or died. In Narela, out of 22,252 entries cited in Congress complaint, 17,684 were found to be unique. In Hoshangabad, 552 entries mentioned in the complaint were checked and no discrepancies were found. In Bhojpur, EC verified 36 cases and found 29 to be genuine. In seven cases the process of deletion has been already on as part of the commission’s continuous updating exercise. The EC concluded that “the allegation of large-scale entries of multiple voters in these four Assembly constituencies is not borne out”. The EC also clarified that, “In addition to the complaint of duplication in the voters’ list, it was pointed out that there has been unexplained growth in the electors in the state of Madhya Pradesh as the EP (elector-population) ratio which used to be 52.76% in 2008 increased to 61.45% in 2018. This has been seen from the perspective of the census data, nothing unusual could be noticed,” EC’s letter to Congress states. The elections to the Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly will be held in November this year.

This, to no one’s surprise, hasn’t gone down well with people with whom nothing has gone down well since May 2014 (except a few riots and protests here and there). This is the previous notice issued by Govt: The people opposing this move have raised some valid points if one stretches the definition of valid points and hence the government has revised its notice to address these concerns. Opindia has exclusive access to text of this leaked notice thanks to our direct access to PMO. Some of the important concerns of eminent intellectuals and politicians are that the notice calls for “indian nationals” (which resembles Indian nationalists instead of saying Indian passport holders) for the purpose of “nation building” (Sanghi speak for oppressing minorities and dalits and adivasis), “outstanding individuals with expertise” (making anyone from left ineligible cause who has time to gain expertise in anything when a revolution is going to overthrow the dictatorship of the bourgeois and fascists), and that they have even dared to clearly mention the sectors the applicant must have experience in – none of them being media, NGO, freelance protester, writer, lifelong JNU PhD candidate, intellectual, evangelist  – thereby ruling out pretty much everyone who can give pro-people insights about sectors they have no clue about. These are real worries and should have been addressed before this notice was released. Behen Mayawati fears Capitalists entering the government through this mechanism and Sitaram Yechury fears hardcore Sanghis – the kind who put angry hanuman graphic on the rear of their cars – entering the government, while other intellectuals fear someone who has never been to a litfest or knows how to spell palimpsest may infiltrate. “We have changed eligibility criteria so that the opposition and intellectuals would be very pleased,” a senior govt official we spoke to on the matter told us on condition of anonymity before emailing us the text of the new notice.

659,OpIndia Staff,"Pop Historian and one-time  cricket administrator Ramachandra Guha who also specialises in propaganda  decided to take on India’s Attorney General KK Venugopal, in one of his tweets on Friday: As seen above, Guha in his tweets raised objections over the Attorney General (AG) supposedly speaking for the BJP Karnataka during the state’s electoral drama and questioned the morality of the same. This “outburst” of Guha seems to pertain  to the Congress party objecting to Governor Vajubhai Vala’s decision to invite BS Yeddyurappa to form the government in Karnataka and his subsequent swearing-in  ceremony, which they wanted stopped. As reported , the Attorney General while appearing before the Supreme Court bench (which was hearing the matter), contended that the Congress should not have filed the petition, and instead should have waited for the floor test’s outcome. He also vehemently opposed the plea which wanted the swearing-in stayed by arguing that the apex court could not call into question the Governor’s discretion to call a party for forming the government. As evident, Guha, raised objection over this role of the Attorney General, and indirectly attempted to bring into question his operating procedure. His attack though was soon busted by social media users, who explained to him why the Attorney General was getting involved in the case. Following Guha’s tweet, lawyer Kartikeya Tanna produced the petition which was filed by Congress leader G Parmeshwara and others against the “Union of India”. The said petitioners in their affidavit had impleaded three respondents, out of which “union of India” was the respondent number one. Hence as contended by Tanna, owing to the “Union of India” being made a respondent by the petitioners, the Attorney General’s association was necessitated owing to him representing the Indian Union: The above point thereby also exposed Guha’s claim of, “the Attorney General speaking for the provincial unit of a political party” – as a lie.

The panchayat elections saw rampant violence  and vote loot which one does not expect to be reflected in the comment sections but it seems people have started to speak up. One comment was telling of the loss of faith. It was made by a woman and she commented about how TMC is slowly but surely turning into a party that Mamata came to power campaigning against. She referred to communist regimes atrocious election management modus operandi comprising of violence and intimidation and how TMC is following the same. She also warned if such tendencies are not countered by them, the People of Bengal will do away with TMC as they did with the communist regime. Her comment comes after rampant violence during the panchayat elections. The election saw a total loss of twenty lives, ballot boxes  being stolen, poll officials threatened and people being intimidated. People were seen speaking against the apparent casualness from the ruling party about the rampant violence and ballot loot in the panchayat elections.

However, in his haste to target the Prime Minister, Tehseen presumably quite deliberately tried to mislead the public by ignoring that the document is titled as a “Tentative Tour Programme” which is dated 6th of April while Prime Minister Modi announced the decision of observing a fast 4 days later. After spotting this attempt to spread misinformation, Twitter users started demanding that Tehseen Poonawalla be arrested for sharing a secret document containing sensitive information about the Prime Minister’s visit on a public platform: It is pertinent to mention that a certain Anupam Pandey, who is incidentally a supporter of Narendra Modi, was booked  under the Official Secrets Act for a very similar reason. He was accused of divulging confidential details of the schedule of the Varanasi trip by Prime Minister Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on social media last month.

667,Rahul Roushan,"Earlier this week, Rahul Raj, one of the co-founders of OpIndia and a popular on Facebook and Twitter as “Bhak Sala” tweeted, asking “Why does Indian Right Wing fail to create many great artists?” and triggered a mini debate on Twitter, as he usually does with his existentialist questions that usually make people attack him. I also ‘threatened ’ to attack him, but like much of the stuff I say on Twitter, it was an exaggeration. However, I did plan to pen my thoughts on it, and here it is. Actually, the answer to the question could become a PhD thesis – it needs to cover education, sociology, politics, history, commerce, narrative, and many other things – but I’d try to cover as many relevant portion and try to keep it short and simple. In attempting to find an answer, one has to first be sure what the question is. “Why does Indian Right Wing fail to create many great artists?” has two terms that should be first defined – “Indian Right Wing” and “artists”. Let’s try to address the easier part first – definition of an artist. General understanding of the term means it refers to people indulged in performing arts as vocation or as hobby i.e. actors, singers, dancers, musicians, painters, sculptors, etc. The definition can also ‘safely’ include writers (poets, lyricists, dramatist, novelists, satirist, etc.) though writing is not strictly a performing art. However, writing complements many performing artists. Associated professions like movie making, documentary making, and comedy (as performing arts e.g. a stand-up comedian) can also be included in the modern definition and was perhaps included by Rahul Raj/Bhak Sala. It has often been debated why one should exclude athletes or sportspersons from this definition? Sports can also be argued to be a performing art. One of the reasons why no sportsperson was given Bharat Ratna before Sachin Tendulkar was because the award was restricted to honoring achievements in the arts, literature, science, and public services. Why should cricket (or any other sports) be not treated as arts? Because cricketers and sportspersons wave tricolor and shout ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ after winning medals? Kidding. As an aside, the criteria of Bharat Ratna were changed to make Tendulkar eligible for it, so the assumed definition of arts still excludes sports. Nonetheless, we are more or less sorted with the easier part of defining an artist. Now let’s come to the trickier or rather the trickiest part – defining Indian Right Wing. Facebook has a term for it – It’s complicated. But for sake of dissecting the question and attempting to find an answer, let’s consider four definitions of the (Indian) Right Wing, that normally passes off in popular parlance and social media debates. First and the foremost, and the most fraud definition, but the most popular as well, is anyone supporting Narendra Modi belongs to the Right Wing in India. For this article, let’s only consider those who are vocal about their support or opposition to Narendra Modi, else we will keep guessing who Right Wing or Left Wing is. Based on this, let’s revisit the original question, which would essentially transform to  First of all, there are, including legends like Lata Mangeshkar, Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher, and many more. However, there are as many, if not more, vocal opponents of Modi too. Then there are people who are ambivalent and not vocal about either support or opposition to Narendra Modi. Yet, one has to admit, that general perception is that many are not with Modi. One aspect that adds to this perception is the fact that those who oppose or hate Narendra Modi are always shouting the loudest, and they wear their hatred on their sleeves (and on their placards), thus appearing to be in majority. Is there a silent majority? We don’t know. However, consider this. What will a professional artist gain by being vocal supporter of Modi? A lying talentless  ‘joker’ like Shirish Kunder is dressed up as some sort of intellectual and his plagiarism  is ignored just because he is a vocal hater of Narendra Modi, while even legends like Bachchan and Kher are subjected to disparaging comments for their support, sometimes not that vocal, for Modi. This is the power that lies with those who control the narrative. Those who control the narrative are not artists, but mostly engaged in non-artistic writing or endeavors i.e. journalists, historians, ‘activists’, etc. I’d go back to one of my earlier articles – hating Modi gives you that paint of respectability . So for your next door ‘artist’, there is no big incentive for being a vocal supporter of Modi in terms of earning daily livelihood or respect. A couple of established ones may benefit temporarily by showing themselves close to ruling party, but I’m talking about a person trying to make his career. The universe and market he operates in has different dynamics and it is controlled by the old Congress-left establishment. Take the example of Nitin Gupta aka Rivaldo. Not a Modi hater, and a very talented stand-up comedian whose style and content are in no way inferior to anyone else in the business. He doesn’t get any support from the fraternity or the media. Once he was at an India Today event, and this is what he said . He might not be there ever again. Contrast that with unfunny comedians getting one platform after another by selling their Modi hatred. Funny thing is they gain all this while crying victimhood. Therefore, if we define Right Wing as per support for Narendra Modi, we know why not many artists ‘appear’ to be Right Wing. They simply can’t afford to. Now let’s go to another definition often tossed around, this time based on culture and religion. Let’s define Right Wing as those who take pride and have sense of belonging to the Hindu culture. Or at bare minimum, those who don’t hate Hinduism or aim to destroy it (which the Cultural Marxists aim to do, for they seen Hinduism as the oppressive force). Now the original question can be paraphrased at  Does it sound right? I will categorize myself as a lapsed ‘Hindu Libertarian’ who is now almost a ‘Paranoid Hindu’ as per my own definition here , but I’m not that paranoid yet. Except for a few placards holding haters on steroids, I don’t really think that many artists fall in this category. Actually, many of those who are vocal opponents of Narendra Modi could also not fall in this category. Say, someone like Javed Akhtar. I might prove to be unpopular among many for saying this, but I believe he is a hater of BJP and Modi, but he doesn’t hate Hindu culture. At least that’s how he was till 2014. The fact that recently he has tweeted regular nonsense  betraying himself as a petty person  insulting anyone not agreeing with him would add make me vulnerable to mocking for supporting Akhtar, but my support is limited on a very narrow topic. Yes, there are instances like his recent tweet on acquittal of Mecca Masjid accused or earlier the bile he poured at the lady police officer for penning a poem against Azad Maidan rioters that might trigger someone to say he is a hater or even an ‘Islamist’, but I’d still say that he is not acidic as some leftist lout from JNU would be towards Hindus and Hinduism. In fact, when everyone, including many Modi supporters were busy mocking Tripura CM for saying internet existed during Mahabharat, Akhtar said  that this belief is no different from what followers of other religions would be nursing. In a way, he opposed singling out Hinduism for mockery. Essentially, you can take my argument as – ‘even’ Javed Akhtar wouldn’t exactly be non-right wing if we go by the above definition. And moving beyond Bollywood, most musicians and singers of Indian classical music are very rooted and proud of our culture. Same about most classical dancers and painters. Even now, the theme in these art forms are from Ramayana or Mahabhrata. Even if not in classical music, dance or painting, most of the Indian artists don’t lose their minds and start behaving like nuts when they have to light a ‘Hindu lamp’ or see a Natraj statue of Lord Shiva. Those often form a part of their daily lives. Yes, there is an attempt by Cultural Marxists to wage a war against these symbols and traditions, but most of the artists have not surrendered, yet. Going by the pro or anti-Hindu definition of Right or Left wing, although there is no empirical data, one can safely assume that most of the artists can actually be called Right Wing. I know some of you can point to me such articles  about how Bollywood has been seeding anti-Hindu bias and I don’t disagree with many points – in fact, I myself have made such observations  – however, you’ve to consider the fact that there are artists beyond Bollywood. Furthermore, Bollywood could have inflicted far worse damage if the ‘anti-Hindu’ forces had entirely dominated it. It was dominated by the old left, which was perhaps not exactly anti-Hindu. The Cultural Marxists, the new left – with ingrained anti-Hinduism – dominates the non-artistic writing (journalism, history writing, political pamphleteering, etc.) field and is trying to gain a stranglehold on arts too. They control the narrative and thus can force the artists into submission or silence, but at least as of now, they are not entirely successful. The cultural war is on, and unfortunately not many see it, but that’s a topic for another day. The third definition, not unique to India unlike the previous two, of Right Wing can be taken as a sociopolitical ideology of conservatism i.e. where you don’t aim for radical changes in the society or politics and want to preserve the traditional social institutions. So the question paraphrases to  Now this question is similar to the earlier one, except that here tradition is not being explicitly defined as Hindu tradition. But the arguments in response can be similar to the earlier one i.e. the radical left has still not taken over the performing arts field and thus this statement is not true, yet. Most artists, especially not from Bollywood, are rooted in tradition. However, the question can also be paraphrased to  Now there is a little truth to it especially if we take the term ‘conservative’ in sociocultural sense. A typical conservative person would stick to rules (often born out of traditions) and won’t like to experiment or innovate too much that upsets the traditional scheme of things, whereas arts is often about pushing the boundaries and creating new things. Say a person who is religious and conservative has to follow strict timeline of waking up, indulging in rituals, prayers, etc. The image of such a person is of a stickler who won’t go beyond what’s in the book. One can argue that this is not conducive to ‘artistic’ or ‘creative’ thinking. However, this discipline and sticking to rules actually is in line with some form of arts, especially music and dance. You can’t innovate too much and create an eight  However, in general sense, arts can’t be bound by too many strict rules. It has to innovate to be relevant, and that’s why a typical textbook conservative approach will not be helpful in being an artist, so the paraphrased question “Why do many conservative Indians fail to become artists?” can’t be outrightly rejected. One can also argue – and I personally subscribe to this stand – that conservativism as understood in the western sense is not applicable in India, as Indic culture and religions are not rigid and bound by some books. However, that is a different debate going into philosophy and theology. The last definition of Right vs Left can be taken as the old one based on economics. Did the original question mean Right Wing as economic ideology i.e. free markets, less government control on business, no labor unions, etc.? If it did, the question would paraphrase to  Again, there is no empirical data, but at least Bollywood definitely was dominated by many who believed in socialist ideas. There were associations and unions of theater artists, writers, etc. that were formed on ideological lines – most of these having the keyword ‘progressive’ in it – and that was one of the reasons why the old left dominated Bollywood. If you wanted work, you couldn’t have gone against the unions and associations. However, there is an interesting thought here. Did the left dominate due to presence of unions? Or is a person believing in free markets less likely to become an artist? As I had said earlier, it can be a topic of thesis and maybe some research papers are already there, but for the scope of this article, I’d say that there indeed are some reasons to believe that a person believing in free markets or capitalism is less likely to be ‘artistic’. Capitalism can appear ugly – unequal distribution of wealth and no guaranteed affirmative action – and free market principles appeal to rational senses – humans are just units in various models – while artistic works are supposed to appeal to aesthetics and emotions of people. A man losing a job can become a great plot for drama for an emotional person, while it could be ‘natural rate of unemployment’ for the rationally minded person. There appears an inherent conflict, and it’s real. A person believing in free markets is more likely to pursue interests that appeal to rational senses than emotional ones. A free market guy will also think about ‘return on investment’. An average artist doesn’t earn as much as an average person indulged in trading or in some vocation based on science or technology. So there is a ‘rational’ reason for not being an artist. Better to invest time and money in acquiring skills that can pay more handsomely. Since this article is already long, I won’t go into much details but one can wonder if it’s possible for the same person to be don both the hats – rational and emotional ones – at different times? Maybe one can. Or a more radical idea. Why not redefine arts? Why should it stick to only aesthetics and emotions? Or why should our idea of aesthetics not evolve with changing times and technology.

668,OpIndia Staff,"At a time when the nation is still coming to terms with the heinous  Kathua rape case, another horrific rape case has emerged  from Surat, Gujarat where a nine-year-old was raped and tortured for nine days before being murdered. While the case from Surat is still under investigations, unverified, fake news started making rounds of social networking sites, most of which claimed involvement of a BJP Gujarat leader. Some of these unverified news were retweeted by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as well. His desperation to malign BJP/ABVP seems so intense that he does not even bother to check whether the news is fake or not. It was not just Arvind Kejriwal, but even other AAP leaders like Dilip Pandey and Alka Lamba, who is best known for her bizarre crying selfie  on seeing the plight of Syrian kids, and delaying  rescue operations during a fire, also retweeted the fake news, who spread this fake news. Even Misa Bharti, daughter of fodder scam convict  Lalu Yadav, who is also under the scanner for alleged scam , retweeted the fake tweet.  However, Surat Police, on social media, has refuted these claims, calling this involvement of BJP/ABVP leaders a fake news, since the case is still under investigation. Following Surat Police’s tweet, Irfan Anjum deleted his tweet which had over 650 retweets, including one by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. However, the other person, Chandrashekhar Bhankrota has not yet deleted his tweet, despite being pointed out by others that this is fake. In his profile picture, Bhankrota can be seen with Congress’ IT cell head Divya Spandana.  However, after being pointed out Arvind Kejriwal has undone the retweet of the fake news he had retweeted. This is progress, considering the last time he set a lower bar of decency  for himself by showing pictures of dead robber, claiming he is an innocent citizen. Under the guise of curiosity, Arvind Kejriwal has regularly spread fake news . Hence, the fact that this time he undid his retweet speaks volumes of his fear of being called out for his lies, especially in wake of vigilant Twitter users who have taken the role of fake news buster. Meanwhile, Darshana Jardosh, Surat MP has taken note of the tweet and said she will take up the case with Surat Police authorities. Update: Surat Police has booked  three people for spreading fictitious and false messages on social media, including one Irfan Anjum, whose tweet Arvind Kejriwal had retweeted before Anjum deleted his tweet.

669,OpIndia Staff,"The Congress party announced its first list of candidates for the Karnataka assembly elections on Sunday and controversies over it just refuse to go away. Not only the party is facing internal revolt  as several party leaders are unsatisfied over being denied tickets, now a fresh issue has surfaced. Recent reports state that Congress has fielded HS Rajamauli, the lawyer of Nirav Modi’s uncle and fraud accused Mehul Choksi as a candidate for the Madikeri assembly seat in the coming elections. The Congress’s choice of HS Rajamauli is being questioned not only being questioned by outsiders, but several party leaders have also expressed displeasure over it. Especially because Rajamauli is a new face in the party and the party has snubbed veteran leader and loyalist Brijesh Kalappa  while declaring Rajamauli as a candidate. The Madikeri seat, for last two elections, is being won by BJP’s Appachu Ranjan. According to reports, Kalappa has expressed his disappointment  over facebook and stated that there was a campaign against him within the party. Kalappa is also Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s legal advisor and a party spokesperson. The BJP has attacked Congress over the choice of Rajamauli as a candidate. However, according to reports, Rajamauli has stated  that the party has winnability factor as a priority while selecting candidates and his performance has been good on the local body elections. He also added that his association with Mehul Choksi was through a legal firm and he has never met him personally. But defending Rajamauli may not work well for Congress well because Rahul Gandhi, during his Shivmoga rally  had alleged that Arun Jaitley’s daughter was a lawyer for Nirav Modi and had criticised BJP over it. The allegations  of Jaitley’s daughter being hired by Nirav Modi’s firm were busted earlier. The Mehul Choksi – Nirav Modi scam had also landed squarely at the Congress’ doorstep  and especially, on P Chidambaram .

670,OpIndia Staff,"Prominent Congress supporter Shehzad Poonawalla who has had a spectacular fall out  with the party and its leadership, has revealed what he claims is a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to the Congress party for bagging it as one of its clients. As reported  by India Today, Shehzad released a 49 page document titled, “Data Driven Campaign: The Path to the 2019 Lok Sabha” – which is supposed to be Cambridge Analytica’s pitch to the Congress party. This document is speculated to have been prepared in August 2017. Under this pitch believed to be prepared by Cambridge Analytica’s CEO Alexander Nix, an election strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the assembly elections in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh was laid out. Shehzad has alleged that the pitch was made in form of a presentation to current Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Few of the tools laid out for the strategy included data mining, national situational analysis, data driven campaign, strategic communication review, media monitoring to name a few. Under data mining, the agency proposed to source data from sources like Facebook, Twitter, party websites, mobile apps and build segments to provide insights. The pitch also proposed the creation of a National Data Infrastructure Project containing an operation centre acting as the party’s nerve centre for campaign coordination and planning. The pitch in question estimated cost of research to be about Rs 2.5 crore which has been termed as “undervalued” by Shehzad who claims the real deal ranges anything between Rs 200 to Rs 500 crore. If indeed true, this revelation might put the Congress party in further soup with regards to its relationship with the controversial data analytics agency. When the “sins” of Cambridge Analytica came into prominence a month back, Congress’ social media head promptly denied  any sort of links with the data agency. This claim was punctured by Cambridge Analytica’s whistleblower who during a hearing at the British parliament named the party as one of the agency’s clients. Further evidence  in this regard emerged when Congress party’s poster was seen hanging on Cambridge Analytica CEO’s office wall while he was interviewed by author and journalist Jamie Bartlett.",2018-04-17,"Big Data,Cambridge Analytica,Congress,Data,Data Analytics,divya spandana,rahul gandhi,Shehzad Poonawalla",Rebel Congress supporter reveals how Cambridge Analytica convinced the party to be its client,https://www.opindia.com/2018/04/rebel-congress-supporter-reveals-how-cambridge-analytica-convinced-the-party-to-be-its-client/

672,OpIndia Staff,"The Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday was cornered by BJP Karnataka over the Lingayat issue, with the latter tweeting out a video which supposedly exposes the former’s hypocrisy over the matter. Back in March, the Congress government in Karnataka had recommended  that the Lingayat community, be given a separate minority religion tag, thereby separating them from the mainstream Hindu religion. This recommendation was seen by many as being a divide and conquer  policy by the Congress party, in a desperate bid to retain power in the southern state. This “Lingayats are not Hindu” stance of the Siddaramaiah led Congress government has now suffered a blow in form of the Karnataka Chief Minister himself contradicting the narrative, in a video put out by the Karnataka BJP twitter account: In the video shared by BJP Karnataka, Siddaramaiah while talking about the minority tag given to the Lingayat community, immediately contradicts himself by commenting that the community too comes under the Hindu fold. Such an admission by Siddaramaiah raises the question as to why did the Congress government try to cast the Lingayats as some separate religious entity when by their own leader’s admission, they are part of Hinduism.

674,Abhishek Banerjee,"Sonia was the boss via the NAC, while Rahul will be a slave to this NAC, the ecosystem. Rahul Gandhi will be even weaker Prime Minister than Manmohan Singh. India, especially Hindus, can not afford this tragedy. This is Nandini Sundar, a professor at Delhi University. She is “deeply saddened” by the deaths of left wing terrorists. But only “saddened” by the deaths of Indian jawans. Not satisfied with equating the martyrdom of an Indian jawan with a terrorist being neutralized, she goes the extra mile, delivers that extra kick in the teeth to rub it in all our faces. This is not about one citizen, this is about the fact that she is a professor at Delhi University.  Presumably, she plays a role in nurturing young minds in the classroom. Beyond the classroom, in her role as an academic, she would also play a role in shaping future scholars who will record, analyze and interpret the story of the Indian nation. Nandini’s husband Siddharth Varadarajan is the mind behind The Wire, whose articles are frequently plugged by Rahul Gandhi himself. In case you have never noticed, between all those Modi bashing articles, The Wire has a separate tag  for “The Soviet Century” where writers post their tributes recounting the ‘glory’ of the fallen Soviet Union. Apparently, nobody at The Wire is saddened, let alone “deeply saddened” by 30 lakh people murdered under Stalin, nor by the 300 lakh people (at least) who perished under the Communist boot worldwide. These are just two members of a much larger class that the people of India have had to carry on their shoulders for decades. They keep pumping their poison into young minds on college campuses. Journalists who are bred in this college environment then push this poison every day into our living rooms through TV screens, through newspapers stuck under our doors early in the morning, through the computers on our desks and the smartphones in our hands. In the so-called scholarly world, Ram is now referred to as a “pig.” Aurangazeb is being resurrected as a spectacularly secular and generous ruler, while Swami Vivekananda’s “masculine posture” has been marked out as an inspiration for gang rape. For Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, who wrote Vande Mataram, the situation is even more dire. Everything that we believe in, anything that we hold dear, anything that we cherish is reviled. Our festivals are smeared with fabricated stories of “semen filled balloons.”  The slightest form of Hindu self-expression, such as a Hanuman sticker on a car, becomes a target for Hinduphobia. How much more poison can we Hindus take? At what point does the poison become so much that our civilization finally drops dead? I fear that the point could be fast approaching. There is a reason Bollywood celebrities rushed in with placards of “Devisthan” and “temple” and “Hindustan” after the Kathua incident. Why would an industry which makes a consumer product that is sold directly to the masses be willing to take such a risk? Because they sense that the poison in our system has finally risen to the level that we as Hindus are paralyzed, unable to even recognize our enemies, let alone act. For India, this form of “rule by the few” is not a new phenomenon. When Nehru opposed the reconstruction of Somnath  Temple on grounds that it would be an embarrassment for a so-called secular nation, he had nothing but contempt for ordinary Hindus and their sentiments. As the Dynasty tightened its grip on “independent India” that their colonial masters had gifted to them, they collected around themselves a class of people who ate out of their hands. This was a group that was inherently quite disparate. While some of them fancied themselves as reborn Englishmen, others occupied themselves with a fascination for the Soviet Union. On the well-tended lawns of Lutyens’ Delhi, they absorbed themselves with ideological debates on matters from Guatemala to Vietnam. There were only two things that this class of people agreed upon: hating Hindus and living off the land. In a sense that is almost medieval and pre-French revolution, these people were the “nobles” of India. The election of 2014 was a revolt by the little Hindu against the ‘nobles’ of Lutyens’ Delhi. The ecosystem suffered a setback. But with nowhere else to go, they decided to stay invested in the Dynasty, considering that the Congress Party had been giving them stable returns for nearly 70 years. In 2019, relying on various Mahagathbandhans and counting on caste-based voters to be useful idiots, they are getting ready for a recapture of power. Here is the difference between Rahul and earlier generations of Gandhis that have ruled India. For autocrats like Indira or Sonia, the ecosystem was a force multiplier, but it always came secondary to the interests of the Congress Party itself. But Rahul is different. Due to his spectacular lack of leadership skills, he will have to compensate by letting the ecosystem off the leash. We have seen a trailer for this in Gujarat, where the incompetent Congress had to take a backseat. The lead was taken by forces that were ready, quite literally, to tear the country apart. Whatever its other faults, it was always in the interest of the Dynasty to at least keep India in one piece, if only to keep its own empire intact. Once the wolves of the ecosystem are off the leash, they will quite literally rip this nation to shreds. Nobody ever rules alone. Every ruler sits on top of a power hierarchy. When the various chieftains sense that the king is weak and incompetent, that the hand of the ruler is weak, they will pounce on the opportunity. The other day I read that JNU’s celebrity “students” Shehla Rashid and Kanhaiyya Kumar are eyeing  the next Lok Sabha polls. There is no doubt that they see the opportunity and they are salivating. Rahul is weak and incompetent, dependent on making any number of compromises to merely stay in the game against Narendra Modi. This is their opportunity to grab for themselves much bigger pieces of the power pie. And what will be the fate of this nation in the hands of the Shehlas and Kanhaiyas? Speaking to Hindustan Times, Kanhaiyya beamed with pride explaining how his hometown is known as “mini-Leningrad.” There you have it, folks, this is the vision of the supposed “youth icons.” They want to take us back, one hundred years into the past, to the days of a nation that collapsed into failure decades ago. They want to uproot us from our land and transport us to “mini-Leningrad.” The Hanuman sticker is anathema to them, but they speak fondly of “mini-Moscow.” The question is whether we can take it as a nation. The wounded civilization of Hindus is still standing despite one thousand years of assault. Who’s to say there can’t be some final death blow out there that will make this much-wounded civilization meet its end? Can we afford to lose 2019 to the Congress? I think not.",2018-04-27,"BJP,Congress,Congress ecosystem,leftists,Liberals,lies,Narendra Modi,nehru,rahul gandhi,Somnath temple,sonia gandhi",Why Rahul could be worse than Sonia and why India cannot afford UPA-III,https://www.opindia.com/2018/04/why-rahul-could-be-worse-than-sonia-and-why-india-cannot-afford-upa3/

Congress party’s official Twitter handle tweeted an old video showing PM Modi sharing the stage with Asaram, in a bid to downplay Modi’s image. After her told tweets went viral, the issue was picked up by journalist Arnab Goswami and debated on his channel, Republic TV. While Divya Spandana admitted that she has known Vijay Mallya since she was a kid and Mallya had also sponsored a holiday for her, she tried to deflect attention by going after Arnab Goswami himself and even Rajeev Chandrasekhar, BJP Rajya Sabha MP. Before these revelations by Divya Spandana, Twitter users had dug up her old tweets praising Mallya. Twitterati even showed how with the change in Mallya’s fate, Divya changed her stand on him. Following Asaram’s conviction, Congress Twitter handle had posted an old video showing PM Modi share stage with Asaram, with a caption how a man is known by the company he keeps, implying Modi should also be held guilty for Asaram’s crimes, just for his association with the rapist even before he was accused of a crime, let alone being convicted. If one follows the same logic, given Divya’s tweets praising Mallya, she should also be held responsible for Mallya’s alleged crimes. The lack of logic was so blinding that Divya even had to issue a clarification that how she is not really responsible for Mallya’s dealings.

Today was one such day when Sagarika while quoting a TOI blog claimed that oppressive jail sentences were meted out to fodder scam convict Lalu Prasad Yadav and that they were a violation of his fundamental human rights. She further questioned whether Lalu was being victimised for his anti-BJP stance: The article she quoted was incidentally co-written by senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi. There he sought to drive home the point that Lalu could well have been provided with a “concurrent” jail sentence in place of the “consecutive” one which has seen him getting sentenced  to 14 years in jail by a CBI court in Ranchi. This verdict saw the judge giving two seven-year jail sentences to Lalu which will be served consecutively. Without much extrapolation, the article in its concluding lines claimed that Lalu’s human and fundamental rights were egregiously violated, which was picked up by Sagarika in her tweet. By going a step further she also floated a conspiracy theory in her tweet by subtly questioning whether the BJP was behind such a sentencing.

678,Abhishek Banerjee,"Simple words. And with these words, the entire Indian liberal campaign of lies, rumours, insinuations and propaganda should have come crashing down. One truth to beat them all. How many times over the last four years do you remember some smug liberal, some academic water carrier of Sonia Gandhi, accusing “Bhakts” of believing in “Whatsapp History?” Journalists, intellectuals, academics, all of them united in opposing the scourge of “fake news,” which they say is the mainstay of the BJP regime. If only people knew the “truth,” they say, the ruling BJP would have no place to hide. So, a string of news websites mushrooms across the internet, all of them speaking in exactly the same voice, spewing the exact same talking points. Every slimy character out there suddenly has the money and resources to start a “fact-checking website” that is heavily promoted both by traditional publications and the new left-wing digital media. One serial fraudster, who has been in and out of jail for blackmailing people with fake videos, made a fake RTI. Got arrested and went to jail…again. When he came out on bail, this career criminal sat down for an interview with one of these websites, where he was introduced as a “senior journalist.” So what about the forgery? They put a spin on it saying he might have been trying to protect a source… So what else was the new left-wing digital media engaged in? Digging out small-time BJP functionaries who may have gotten this or that photograph wrong. Ah, there … there goes the secretary of the IT cell of the XYZ morcha of some BJP district committee in Haryana. He/she has shared this pic about violence in Bengal which happens to be wrong. Let’s ignore the riot in Bengal and expose him/her. Meanwhile, their side is possibly engaged with Cambridge Analytica, using social media to steal people’s private information so that they can be targeted with carefully tailored doses of fake news. While liberals on Twitter rail about smalltime trolls doing propaganda, their side is likely using big money to manufacture big fake news. For every citizen, a personal profile to be created by stealing data from their social media presence. Then, everyone is to be matched with a customized packet of fake news to influence their voting behaviour. And all this time, they were telling us that Aadhar is way too much. When you tell them that people are already sharing every minute detail about their personal lives on social media, they have the technical excuse ready. They say Aadhar is compulsory, whereas social media participation is voluntary. When you point out that this is a distinction in principle with no difference to the outcome, they don’t care. Your privacy is dead anyway once you get on Facebook. This privately owned foreign company already has a minute by minute record of your life.  You might as well give the Government of India your name, date of birth and fingerprints. No, they insist. Never. So what do they have to say now? Turns out that this data was actually being stolen without our knowledge. Possibly to serve the electoral interests of a lazy crown prince. The writing was already on the wall the day the Cambridge Analytica story broke across the world but liberals in India were quiet as scared children. If they had even the slightest excuse to link Narendra Modi to Cambridge Analytica, they would have pounced upon him instantly. But they had a fairly clear idea of who Cambridge Analytica was working for and so they were silent. The whole “Destroy Aadhar” crowd didn’t give a damn about the loss of privacy as long as it served the anti-BJP agenda. The only reason they were against Aadhar is that Modi had made it a cornerstone of its policy. Plus, a class that had feasted for 60 years on the corruption had an instinctive problem with an anti-corruption measure. So days passed and no one in the Indian media and/or intelligentsia had anything to say about Cambridge Analytica.

679,OpIndia Staff,"According to the Open Magazine , a new document has surfaced which suggests that the Indian National Congress might have been in discussions with the disgraced Cambridge Analytica to organize its campaign in the upcoming Assembly election polls in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, apart from the 2019 General Election itself. Open Magazine claims that it is in possession of a detailed proposal by the firm that outlines its plan to turn around the fortunes of the party that appears to be in decline. The papers state that the firm’s help will be critical ‘when the INC faces its first existential challenge at the 2019 Lok Sabha and competes with the incumbent BJP’. The firm plans to use ‘a combination of data analytics, behavioural science and targeted communications’ to help the Congress party. Whistle-blower Chris Wylie in a disposition to the UK House of Commons also claimed that the Congress party was one of the clients of the firm. He said  in response to an MP’s question,   Cambridge Analytica and its parent’s firms are reported to have been involved in over 200 elections in multiple countries across the world. Recently, Quartz reported  that Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm significantly influenced South Asian politics. The SCL group claims that it came to Indonesia at the behest of “pro-democratic groups” to “assist with a national campaign of political reform and democratization.” During the assignment, the firm organized massive rallies at universities to help students “let off steam”. It sponsored “organized avenues of protests” to draw students away from violent protests. The SCL documents state, “Large rallies were organised at each university. This was achieved by establishing a rally committee and financing activities and coverage across the country.” They add, “The events were so large that there was a general feeling amongst students that their voice really had been heard.” In Thailand, its mandate was supposed to ascertain the pattern of vote-buying behaviour in constituencies and identify how open a particular constituency was to accept a change in their behaviour. It has been reported  that Cambridge Analytica was interfering in elections in Nigeria and Kenya as well. But the verdict appears to be that they were not very successful with their strategy. However, the failure in one particular scene should not be translated to mean that they weren’t able to elections elsewhere. The firm supposedly managed the successful election campaign of President Donald Trump which saw him score the most improbable election victory of the century thus far. The Congress has been in troubled waters  since the scandal broke out. After alleging the BJP of a data leak, the official apps of the Indian National Congress  and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah  disappeared from the Play Store. It became apparent that a section of the media  is trying to protect the Congress party but with the emergence of an image that showed the Congress party symbol adorning  Cambridge Analytica’s office and now the document assessed by Open Magazine, Congress’ involvement with the disgraced firm is becoming harder to deny every day.",2018-04-02,"2019 elections,assembly elections,Cambridge Analytica,Congress,Karnataka Assembly election,lok sabha,rahul gandhi",Cambridge Analytica was to help Congress ‘when it faces its first existential challenge at the 2019 Lok Sabha’?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/04/cambridge-analytica-was-to-help-congress-when-it-faces-its-first-existential-challenge-at-the-2019-lok-sabha/
680,Rahul Roushan,"Janeudhari Pandit Rahul Gandhi – an avatar of the Congress President that was discovered in the run up to the last year’s Gujarat assembly elections – these days is busy showing how he and his party support Dalits. Among massive steps he has undertaken for Dalit empowerment is tweeting furiously whenever he or his party can plug in the rhetoric of Dalit rights or empowerment. For them, though, it doesn’t matter that in the process they end up spreading fake news  about atrocities against Dalits or end up eulogizing an incoherent demagogue who didn’t exactly have favorable views  about Dalits. He did the same again earlier today , trying to attack BJP and the RSS over a controversy created after a Supreme Court ruling, which ordered that some preliminary inquiry must be done by the police before acting on any complaint filed under the (prevention of atrocities) SC/ST act. Again, it didn’t matter to him that the BJP led government had filed a review petition  against the ruling, which the court said was aimed at stopping misuse of the law. While Rahul Gandhi trying to score political points over Dalits is entirely understandable and even legitimate given the kind of politics we are attuned to seeing in India, it amuses me no end when Congress tries to project itself as the messiah of Dalits, and even gets away with it. As someone born in Bihar and having witnessed the deeply casteist politics and society, Congress being a party sympathetic to Dalits sounds as much bizarre to me as Dawood Ibrahim being a person who is paragon of patriotism. But wait, there are journalists who do try to paint Dawood as patriotic, so it’s not really surprising that Congress gets away with it. However, I decided to pen down my thoughts because sometimes what we assume to be a common knowledge becomes ‘revelations’ for many, which was witnessed yesterday after many people on Twitter shared the stories about Lalu Yadav’s jungle raj, and many of them were surprised  to find that their stories, rather experiences, ended up shocking many. And it does shock me when Congress is painted as a party that was ‘naturally’ supported by the Dalits, for I can’t imagine that scenario due to the political history of Bihar that I have witnessed and heard about. I was born in an upper-caste family in Patna, Bihar and every member supported the Congress party. Not just members of my family, the extended family members from both the father’s and the mother’s side, and members of the same caste residing the our locality too supported Congress as their ‘natural party’. We were so much emotionally attached to the party and the Nehru-Gandhi family, that when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, I, barely an eleven years old boy then, cried as if there was a personal loss. Obviously, I had no idea about politics then, but this shows the extent of support the party enjoyed from the upper castes, or at least from those from my family, locality, and the ancestral village. The fact that Congress was the preferred by and the ‘natural party’ of upper castes mostly in Bihar is not only supported by my anecdote but the fact that Congress could never get back to power in Bihar – they were reduced to being a marginal player – once Lalu Yadav rose to power on slogans that targeted the upper castes. It is a separate story that the same Lalu is now a loyal soldier of the same party, but that’s an analysis for later day. But does Congress being the preferred party of the upper castes essentially mean Dalits didn’t like the party, or that the party didn’t like the Dalits? One won’t be entirely wrong to infer it based on the fact that Congress’ demise in Bihar is synonymous with upper castes losing political clout, however, there are many other reasons to infer the same. Bihar was and possibly continues to be one of the most caste sensitive states in India. One can’t deny the power imbalance between the upper castes – four castes primarily, viz. Brahmins (also called Baabhan in local dialects), Bhumihars (who are supposed to be Brahmins as well, technically), Rajputs, and Kayasthas (also termed as Lala) – and rest of the castes. This imbalance resulted in frequent and consistent social friction. In Bihar, even Baniyas are listed in the backward castes, while almost everywhere else in the country they are supposed to be a forward caste. There was a widespread belief – and it was not entirely unfounded – that the aforementioned four castes enjoyed disproportionate power and wealth (in relative term, as Bihar hardly was a wealthy state) in the society. During the 90s, Lalu rose to power with the slogan –  Due to the sheer arithmetic in his favor, his supporters as well as detractors believed that Lalu will break all records and rule for a record duration, breaking the communists’ record in the neighboring West Bengal. He indeed in a way represented aspirations of the lower castes – OBCs as well as the Dalits. Again, Lalu’s fall from that position of might and invincibility is another topic of analysis. But what I want to highlight is the vertical division in the society between the upper castes and lower castes (including the Dalits) where they almost stood for opposite things and their interests clashed. So, if the upper castes supported the Congress, it’s ridiculous to suggest that the party was a pro-Dalit party, at least in Bihar. One can wonder how come Congress continued to rule Bihar if only a handful of castes supported it. What about the numerous elections that returned Congress to power? How come it took only Lalu in the 90s to exploit an arithmetic that was so obvious for anyone else to exploit. That’s where I’ve to fall back on anecdotes because our ‘intellectuals’ clearly have not been honest in assessing Congress’ legacy in these matters. Stories from elders would reveal how the lower castes, especially the Dalits, were not even aware of their democratic rights, especially in the villages. Either they wouldn’t even vote – while ballot papers would be stamped in their names – or they would forcibly be kept away from voting. The ‘booth capturing’ by Lalu’s goons was inspired from these acts earlier by the upper castes, who captured booths for the Congress party. Lalu’s men took it to a new level that was one of the reasons of their downfall. A village elder would tell me that earlier Yadavs would wield lathis on behalf of Bhumihars and capture booth for a few bucks, but they soon realized that if they possess the power of lathi, why should they wield it for Bhumihars and settle for a few bucks when the entire government treasury could be theirs! I’m sure very village in Bihar has such stories, which somehow our  , which doesn’t allow any mud to stick.The family has that paint Irony is that many such ‘historians’ would cite Belchi  massacre near Patna during the post-emergency days when Congress was out of power for the first time in center and was also out of power in Bihar. Indira’s visit to Belchi where at least 8 Dalits were killed (not by men belonging to the any of the aforementioned four upper castes by the way) is shown as proof of how she won back public support, especially support of Dalits. At best she might have impressed Dalits of a one particular village by making a personal visit, but to suggest that Dalits voted for Congress in Bihar en masse has to be a fiction. There was no reason why they should vote for a party that hardly gave them any share in power and which patronized those who’d chase them away from polling booths or do much worse things. Due to this history and context of caste politics in Bihar, I find it entirely farcical and ironic when Congress tries to paint itself as a party that has cared for Dalits or the lower castes. Two of their citadels – Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – were the first to be Congress mukt, much before Narendra Modi was even a force to reckon with, and the reason was rise of politics of so-called lower castes. That’s why I find the pro-dalit statements, rather noises by Rahul Gandhi mere a lip service. While he and some others in Congress have expressed regret over the 1984 anti-Sikh genocide, not one leader of Congress has expressed regret for what they did to the lower castes. Keeping people away from voting is murder of democratic rights. Patronizing goons who unleashed caste violence is literally patronizing murder. But no one asks the family such questions. The latest trend  is to hound and insult anyone who dares to put a question to Rahul Gandhi, and thus the Congress President can continue with his meaningless rhetoric. Today, he is essentially blaming BJP and RSS for a mess and imbalance created by elements emboldened and promoted by his party and family. Nonetheless, these questions have to be asked and these stories need to be told, else the ",2018-04-02,"Analysis,Bihar,caste politics,Casteism,Dalits,History,Indira Gandhi,Lalu Prasad Yadav,narrative,Nehru-Gandhi family,Opinions,Propaganda,rahul gandhi,Society",Congress’ love for Dalits is as fake as janeu of Rahul Gandhi,https://www.opindia.com/2018/04/congress-love-for-dalits-is-as-fake-as-janeu-of-rahul-gandhi/

682,Divya,"Social media is going ballistic with memes on Rahul Gandhi’s fast for communal harmony. A medium that is overrun with Right Wing trolls is enjoying its moment in the sun over the alleged failure of the fast. But before getting carried away with this negativity (which BJP thrives on and encourages), let’s stop for a moment and look at the larger picture. Why did Rahul Gandhi call for this fast? Why would someone who could savour the best of culinary delights sacrifice his food for 5 long hours? This was mainly necessitated by the need to undo the political and socially vitiated fabric of India since 2014. Oscar Wilde once said, “After a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relatives”. As we all know, Rahul Gandhi is all about love and forgiveness and it is to his credit that he is bringing Oscar Wilde’s words to life. An Irish proverb too states that “laughter is the brightest in the place where the food is”. Can we deny the now often proven relationship between Rahul Gandhi and laughter? Contrast this with the sentiment inspired by the other brand leader in the race! In fact, Virginia Woolfe went even further and said: “One cannot think well, love well and sleep well if one has not dined well”. Do we really need a leader (who prides his fasting prowess during the Navratras) when an empty stomach leads to lack of thinking and loving? The great J.R.R.Tolkein once said “If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world”. And God, do we know how much of love, cheer and song we need in this Sanghi world! Going forward, the Culinary Master Anthony Bourdain himself quotes “I’ve long believed that good food, good eating, is all about risk. Whether we are talking about unpasteurised Stilton, raw oysters or working for organised crime associates, food for me has always been an adventure”. Rahul Gandhi has indeed proved his risk-taking abilities by focussing on food here, irrespective of what the haters say. Risk taking is an important attribute for a man desirable of holding the PMs chair. Finally Julia Child succinctly wraps up the argument by saying “People who love to eat are the best people. Cannot really explain it better than that.",2018-04-09,"fast,humour,Politics,rahul gandhi,rahul gandhi defence league,Sarcasm,Satire","Rahul Gandhi won hearts today with his fast, RW trolls should read this to know how",https://www.opindia.com/2018/04/rahul-gandhi-won-hearts-today-with-his-fast-rw-trolls-should-read-this-to-know-how/
683,OpIndia Staff,"Rahul Gandhi has been on a campaigning spree after the Supreme Court ruling on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act became news and he has been accusing  PM Modi and BJP repeatedly for attempting to dilute the law. Though Rahul Gandhi’s accusations without fact-check are rather usual, this time his allegations are on a sensitive issue. The nation witnessed widespread violence on 2nd April, when Dalit groups protested across several states resulted in several deaths. In his rallies in poll-bound Karnataka, Rahul tweeted that ‘the RSS and the BJP have it in their DNA to keep Dalits at the lowest level of the society’. Before that, Rahul Gandhi had led a delegation of Congress leaders to meet the President and stated that the SC/ST Act is being diluted . In the Shivmoga election rally too, on the day of Bharat Bandh, Rahul accused the BJP of diluting the act. Rahul, however, has chosen to completely ignore the amendments brought in by the BJP government to make the act more stringent brought in by the amendment bill in December, 2015 to make it more effective and helpful to those who are the victims of atrocities. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, which brought  forward ‘The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015’, made several significant changes to the existing act of 1989. [pdf ] The amendment act included a list of activities that are derogatory and offensive in nature under the previous act. The new act also provided for the IPC offences attracting less than ten years of imprisonment to be registered under the PoA Act. The amendment Act also called for exclusive special courts and exclusive special public prosecutors for speedy trial and judgements for the benefit of SCs and STs while giving special courts the power to take cognizance of the offence and complete trials within two months from the date of filing the charge sheet. It added a chapter to the ‘Rights of Victims and Witnesses’ and called for the clear definition of ‘willful’ negligence on part of public servants at all levels under this act. After the Supreme Court order  on 20th March, the central government had filed a review petition  in the apex court. Though yesterday the apex court denied any interim stay on the order, the hearings are to continue. The Supreme Court in its yesterday’s hearing on the petition stated that the order was only meant to protect  the rights of the innocent and prevent the misuse of a stringent law. Rahul Gandhi and several other politicians who have deliberately spread misinformation that the BJP government is making deliberate attempts to dilute the law must consider this. The violent protests  took lives and destroyed valuable public properties. The Dalits who actually face problems and who are the very people this law aims to protect should be provided with the correct facts. While there are constant debates on whether the protests had political backing, the fact remains that people lost lives, law and order were disrupted and huge losses were incurred. The Supreme Court bench comprising of Justices AK Goel and UU Lalit stated that the people agitating are misinformed about the order and have been misled. A detailed reading of the order dated 20th March shows that the Supreme Court has not diluted the law in any way but has merely put some safeguards in place so that innocents are spared from frivolous complainants.",2018-04-04,"ammendment act,Bharat Bandh,BJP,PM Modi,Rahul Gandhi lies,review petition,SC/ST act,supreme court,violence",How true are Rahul Gandhi’s allegations that the BJP is diluting the SC/ST Act?,https://www.opindia.com/2018/04/how-true-are-rahul-gandhis-allegations-that-the-bjp-is-diluting-the-sc-st-act/

685,Rohan,"People have disparaged the credibility behind Veer Savarkar’s life, by constantly branding him as a “loyal colonialist”. But these are the same people who find any excuse to oversee the suffering he had undergone and the truthful motives behind all his actions. He is perhaps the only freedom fighter who has faced the ‘privilege When you see a Congress leader remove his plaque in the cellular jail that became his memorial; when you see the president of the same party getting cheered after claiming Savarkar was “begging for mercy and clemency”; when you see an unreasonable tweet (embedded below) labelling him as a traitor, you seriously wonder what led to this utter defamation and whether he deserves such decisive slander. Such questions have led me to write this article. While there are many false allegations against Veer Savarkar, in this article, I plan to specifically address the allegations of him being a “traitor” and a “British Stooge”. While it is sad to see such irresponsible remarks on a freedom fighter, we need to realise why such remarks are very disingenuous. Perhaps the most prototypical argument against Savarkar is the one that gives him the tag of a “traitor”. When Congress members tell us today that he was “anti-national” because he sent ‘mercy petitions and clemencies’ to British in jail, I simply ask: What got him  Nevertheless, the selectively quoted letters  Have a look at  Make no mistake when you look at their choice of words like “bitter complaints about other convicts from his party receiving better treatment,” they say, as though his objections were somehow juvenile, unreasonable and jealous of his compatriots. Of course, the complaints will seem “bitter” when The Wire skips the other part of his mercy petition. Perhaps it was too long to insert (the omitted part in bold, emphasis added): Note here, that the solitary confinement had him spending his life all alone for six months, while other people had a share of interaction. They additionally made him pound coir with his bare hands where his hands were often dripped with blood. He had to manually turn a massive wheel, that would squeeze coconuts for oil and had to produce about 30 pounds a day. While this punishment was only given to those who were “not behaving with the guards”, Savarkar was often made  to do it despite his good conduct. Left all alone, he scraped poems on the prison walls: “The soul that suffers get stronger. The aim is freedom of the motherland”. In order to torment him, the guards whitewashed the walls one which he scraped poems.  Having to go through life all alone, being allowed to write letters once in a year and a half, to his loved ones and going through tremendous physical and mental torture in a compressed cell. I ask all the Congressmen, how easy is that? But the most upsetting fact about the criticism Savarkar gets is the fact that he did not leave his love for the motherland, behind when tortured. The Wire, is happy with the reader believing that the letter was only about Savarkar bickering with jealousy on “other convicts from his party”, but it is that very letter that involves him expressing his feelings on Indians and asking for every prisoner to be released, with the exception of him (emphasis added): But people still accuse being a colonialist, because he encouraged Indian soldiers to join the British army. However, icons such as Bose and Ambedkar recognised  the purpose behind Indianising the British army, because it would create room for an internal rebellion, instead of losing by fighting on the Indian side and getting killed by the British. On many occasions, we have seen Indians side the British, in far less demanding situations, and still be called freedom fighters. If a man like Rahul Gandhi ignores Savarkar’s fight for independence and only wishes to look at him encouraging Indians to fight for the British (for quite justified reasons), perhaps he must also know that Mahatma Gandhi wanted Indian soldiers to fight for the British during the First World War. But that does not mean the father of our nation was anti-national, does it? If we get into specifics, Nehru wished for the same thing in World War II. When Indian soldiers actually had to fight for the British in the Second World War and give up a lot of lives, Bose and Savarkar were radically opposed to giving up Indian men for the British cause when Nehru staunchly supported it. Going by the typical Congressman’s logic, Nehru too can be labelled as a “traitor” for encouraging Indian soldiers to join the British army. But when Nehru does it, they call it “political astuteness” and when Savarkar does it in more justified situations, they call it “treachery”. Dear Congress, why this pseudo-analysis? Their school of thought cherry-picks quotations of Savarkar’s writings and strongly misrepresents his intentions, by stooping to the lows of mockery.  Their narrative is dishonest and profoundly manipulative. It not only demeans Savarkar’s actual contributions but even ridicules his unimaginable sufferings. A truthful analysis of his letters, words and works tell us, that the “siding of colonialism” just consisted of measures taken to be safe from the British who suspected him, while he continued to work and serve the cause of Indian independence. But still, this debate has more meaning than whataboutery. The purpose of this article has been to honestly illustrate the context behind Savarkar’s actions; the same actions that people unfairly hold against him.",2018-03-24,"british,Colonial,Congress,Congress lies,Freedom Fighter,Gandhi,hindutva,MK Gandhi,Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,Rahul Gandhi lies,Sanatan Dharma,Veer Savarkar,Vinayak Damodar Savarkar","Dear Rahul Gandhi, how long do you plan to mislead people about Veer Savarkar by calling him a ‘traitor’",https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/dear-rahul-gandhi-how-long-do-you-plan-to-mislead-people-about-veer-savarkar-by-calling-him-a-traitor/

This has prompted various comedians and bloggers alike to create spoofs and mocking posts of Rahul Gandhi. The Congress party though now seemingly has decided to try and forcibly erase this legacy of Rahul. As per a twitter user and TEDx contributor Vikas Pandey, the Congress party is trying hard to take down less than glorifying videos of their party President: As per the image shared by Pandey, the “I Support Narendra Modi” YouTube channel had received a copyright take down notice, which was issued by Indian Nation Congress (INC) for their video titled, “Mil Gaya Rahul Gandhi Ke Pappu Hone Ka Saboot – Singapore Video Question & Answer Session”. As a result of this notice, the video was rendered unplayable on YouTube. Owing to this act by Indian Nation Congress (INC), the channel also received “One copyright strike” and in case of such multiple notices, the channel might get pulled down by YouTube. Also in what some might call a “peculiar coincidence”, the news of the twitter account of @NKDeewan getting suspended was also reported today: Deewan a witty twitter user incidentally had achieved quite a bit of online fame in the recent past by creating hilarious spoofs of Rahul Gandhi . His suspension provoked an outcry with people using the hashtag #bringbackdeewan to demand the restoration of his account: This suspension incidentally comes after recent suspension of RW accounts for “technical” violation of terms  such as suicide. Incidentally it might also be argued that when it comes to getting videos removed from YouTube, the Congress is taking a leaf out of  Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) book, which is in line with what OpIndia has predicted .

The CPM has also claimed that regional parties like BJD, TRS and TDP won’t accept an alliance with the Congress. The CPM last month also made it clear in a draft political resolution that it won’t indulge in any alliance or understanding with the Congress for defeating the BJP. The editorial has also proceeded  to signal all round doom for the opposition by warning that a non-BJP, non-Congress “Federal front”, which was conceptualised by Telangana Chief Minister KC Rao, was also bound to fail. Such hostility of the CPM towards the Congress and possibly the larger opposition might be ironic considering, the left parties were amongst those who had attended  Sonia Gandhi’s dinner, which was meant to send a message of opposition unity. This editorial also comes in the backdrop of the CPM alleging discrepancies  in the Rajya Sabha nomination paper of Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi. Singhvi is contesting from West Bengal and has received supported for the same from the TMC. The CPM leader Rabin Deb who was contesting against Singhvi had alleged  that the Congress leader’s nomination papers were forged and had demanded that they be cancelled. The other allegations levelled include a discrepancy in Singhvi’s age, his statement being forged and the notary papers being stamped and not signed. Singhvi has then retorted  against the allegations, by calling them “petty and puerile”. While terming the allegations as malicious and false, Singhvi claimed that the CPM was convinced of its defeat and hence had stopped “fighting like gentlemen”.  The report also claimed that Singhvi hadn’t yet ruled out filing a defamation case against the communist party.",2018-03-23,"abhishek manu singhvi,Articles,communists,Congress,CPM,leftists,Rajya Sabha,Sitaram yechury,sonia gandhi,United Opposition,UPA",CPM starts causing trouble in the ‘united opposition’ days after it was conceptualised,https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/cpm-causing-trouble-united-opposition-upa/
689,OpIndia Staff,"The recent Supreme Court verdict in the case   Anticipatory bail was denied  for accused under the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) act. The verdict has also made way for an anticipatory bail to accused if there is no prima facie case. Anticipatory bail  is a provision in the law that allows a person to seek a bail if he/she anticipates an arrest on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence. In its judgement [pdf ] the apex court said : 
 This has raised concerns among the SC/ST community as the rate of conviction are already low under the act. They have also felt that the judgement would dilute the provisions of the act which protect the community from atrocities. This argument might have some validity. The need of the hours is to find a balance between protection of the SC/ST community from atrocities and prevent its misuse. Instead of working on a solution, the Congress party has decided to politicise the matter. This is a purely logical debate which must be examined from the legal point of view. A group of BJP MPs belonging to SC/ST community have met  the law minister and asked him to file a review petition on the matter. This issue could turn into a test of perception for BJP as well. The SC and ST community has supported the party in several elections and its support is crucial for any party to succeed in the key state of Uttar Pradesh. Any indication that the party is against their interests will turn the tide against the party. Thus, it would seem like a catch-22 situation for BJP. While the Court has issued its judgement based on misuse of the law, BJP would also need to balance the perception battle with the logical steps that need to be taken to not only protect the interests of the SC/ST community but also curb misuse of the law.",2018-03-23,"Atrocities Act,BJP,Congress,Narendra Modi,rahul gandhi,SC/ST act,supreme court",Supreme Court verdict on SC/ST act and the battle of perception for BJP,https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/supreme-court-verdict-on-sc-st-act-and-the-battle-of-perception-for-bjp/
690,OpIndia Staff,"The Siddaramiah led Congress government in Karnataka has taken yet another step towards dividing the society in the state. Recently, the government had sought to separate  Lingayats  from Hinduism. This time it has picked the police force. In a hurriedly conducted  survey based on a circular issued on March 17, the state’s policemen were asked to provide their caste details. The move has attracted the criticism of the BJP This move is strikingly similar to the larger insidious plan of the Congress-led government at the centre when it had tried to divide the army by asking  for the religious composition of armed forces in 2006. The home minister Ramalinga Reddy in his response  to a Kannada channel Suvarna News has said that it was a part of ‘2-year-old routine survey by backward class [commission] and the new circular was sent as previous ones were not answered’. He added that this survey was not restricted to police force but all government departments. The minister further added that the move was not related to elections when questioned by the channel. Caste/religion census may adversely affect the morale of the security/police forces.

One is reminded of the fact that Chidambaram, when he was the Union Home Minister back in 2012, had questioned  the urban middle class complaining about price rise by saying how can they complain when they can buy ice cream for Rs. 20. Interestingly, former finance minister’s family also owns  a 200-acre coffee estate in Coorg, Karnataka, which is inherited by Chidambaram from his grandfather Raja Annamalai Chettiar in 1956, for which they receive agricultural income for which they have claimed full exemption from income tax. As expected, Chidambaram got mocked for his statements which showed how he is so far from reality. Interestingly, there are even reports  of Karti, P Chidambaram’s son, having created a huge real estate empire for himself through his company Advantage Strategic Consulting, which also holds some franchisees of Café Coffee Day, the same coffee chain Chidambaram rejected the tea from, in parts of Malaysia. Some even reminded how the price of coffee has more or less been the same even when he was the finance minister and home minister. While many were just amused at the fact that perhaps the former finance minister has paid for his own tea or coffee for the first time. And some reminded him how easy it was to file his grievances for the cost of coffee instead of tweeting about it.

692,OpIndia Staff,"Journalist Saikat Datta, who is South Asia editor of Asia Times and formerly covered National Security for Hindustan Times, today posted a screenshot of a Facebook profile of a girl ‘Sanjana Singh’. He claimed that the profile was of same NCC cadet interviewed by news agency ANI after Rahul Gandhi claimed ignorance  regarding NCC training ‘and that type of stuff’. However, even a cursory look at two pictures, of the Facebook profile shared by Saikat and the picture of the NCC cadet, would reveal that the two women aren’t the same .  Another ‘journalist’, Salil Tripathi, went on to further that lie accusing the NCC cadet of wearing the uniform while trying to score political brownie points.   He also went on the to do some ‘mansplaining’ and justified hounding the NCC Cadet because she was a “woman” and not a “girl”. Saikat Datta deleted the tweet after multiple people pointed out that the profile is not the same of the girl who was interviewed by ANI. Interestingly, a so-called parody account, ‘Real History Pic’, had also shared the same screenshot of the same girl last night. Yesterday we had reported  how the so-called journalists turn bullies whenever someone asks an uncomfortable question to Congress President Rahul Gandhi. Hence, when a screenshot of a Facebook profile, posted by a propaganda account masquerading as parody and a ‘journalist’ appear very similar (just the image of the girl is cropped), doubts are raised if the image is shared by the same source. This is not the first time someone has shared a fake image to score a political brownie point and then deleted it after spreading the misinformation far and wide. Politician and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who was a part of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) before Kejriwal removed him from the party had shared  an unverified image with wrong information. Later in September last year, ‘journalists’ and politicians had shared  fake images of girls beaten up by police in BHU. It appears like a shoot and scoot pattern is an easy way to spread lies and fake news without responsibility. At a time when tweets and screenshots of tweets which contain fake news and rumours can easily be shared over social mediums like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, people in influential positions should be all the more mindful of ensuring they don’t reveal personal details and endanger lives of citizens.",2018-03-26,"bullying,Congress,Congress ecosystem,congress IT cell,fake pic,Media Lies List,NCC,Propaganda,Propaganda by media,rahul gandhi,rahul gandhi defence league,real history pic,saikat datta",Journalists spreads fake news to malign NCC cadet who exposed Rahul Gandhi,https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/saikat-datta-ncc-cadet-sanjana-singh-rahul-gandhi-journalist/
693,Nithesh S,"The Congress party is taking India on a sinister path where some people could be misled to believe that the election commission is the instrument of one party and not an independent body. This is a dangerous trend that can hurt democracy and the election commission if the practice becomes a trend among opposition parties. Congress had proposed that the election commission should return  to paper ballots in its plenary’s political resolution. The party is out to defame and diminish the election commission and its infrastructure for scoring political brownie points whenever it finds an opportunity.continued This practice of the Congress  However, the actual counting day was announced as 15th May by EC.  The same news was tweeted by the Karnataka IT Cell in charge of Congress as well. Malviya became a punching bag for all journalists and defenders of democracy, while questions were not raised on the Congress IT member. They claimed that the EC was now subservient to BJP IT cell. This is a far-fetched comment as it appears that both Congress and BJP IT cell members had fallen for a piece of false news. The main culprit, Times Now, was spared from all blame in the episode. The chief election commissioner when asked by media as to how this information had leaked, he said that the matter would be investigated  in depth. While the unqualified criticism of smaller parties and journalists can be ignored to some extent, irresponsible comments from a pan India party like Congress should raise eyebrows. The party extended its criticism to the election commission as well. The tweet by Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala is one of the best examples of this. He claimed that the ‘credibility of the EC was at test and an FIR should be registered against BJP IT cell head.’ Mr Surjewala should be aware that Srivatsa  (Karnataka IT cell in charge) would also be a part of this FIR. If a notice is sent to Amit Shah, even Rahul Gandhi should be receiving one. Ironically, another Congress spokesperson felt that the BJP IT cell head would get away with it and ‘BJP is messaging that is not bound by laws’. It appears that Rahul’s partymen have picked up the art of making baseless wild allegations without any prima facie evidence. Tehseen Poonawallah, on the other hand, claimed that the Congress didn’t have an IT Cell head at all in order to isolate his party from possible criticism. This claim is ridiculous because the man has appeared  in media reports as a ‘convenor’ of Karnataka IT cell. While he may not be the ‘head’ of Karnataka IT cell, he surely belongs to the top line of Congress social media team in Karnataka. Meanwhile, the Congress IT cell guy washed off his hands from the matter by merely saying that he tweeted the news flashed by Times Now. The same luxury is somehow not accorded to Amit Malviya of the BJP IT cell.  The leader of Congress in Lok Sabha continues to hurl baseless allegations on BJP and the Election commission even as several media reports have highlighted that both BJP and Congress IT cell guys had fallen for the Times Now news flash on election dates for Karnataka. Amit Malviya and the BJP have submitted a letter explaining the reason for the controversial tweet and allegations flying around as a result of it. The onus is now on the EC to investigate the matter in an impartial manner and ascertain as to how Times Now accessed the information. The Congress had questioned  the independence of EC even during the Gujarat polls. It seems that the declining electoral fortunes of the Congress have led to the strategy of shooting the messenger instead of fixing their party.

Many Twitter users received emails from Twitter asking them to delete their tweets which had the phrase ‘kill me’ in them because, clearly, when someone says ‘kill me’, the person means it literally and not figuratively. Interestingly, tweets which contained the word ‘kill’ were asked to be deleted by Twitter for ‘violation’ of general rules. Considering some of these tweets date back to 2014, it is surprising Twitter woke up now, in 2018, to show concern to Divya and her alleged suicidal/murderous tendencies.

697,Abhishek Banerjee,"The other day social media erupted with jokes as Arvind Kejriwal’s written apology  to ex-Punjab Minister Bikram Majithia went public. Now there is nothing wrong with a little bit of fun. The question is : was the joke really on us? Let’s take a look at the course of events. Arvind Kejriwal, backed up by an entire media choir, went around spread the “information” that Punjab is crying for help under a drug menace. The youth of Punjab had been left hopeless and unemployed, coping with the despair in their daily lives by taking drugs. And who was to blame for the supposed doom and gloom in Punjab? The Akali-BJP government of course, which was then in its second consecutive term in the state. They had been elected for a second term in 2012, breaking the long running cycle of incumbency in state. Not only was the Akali-BJP government responsible, it was also directly culpable in the drug menace, with Bikram Majithia, a relative of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, supposedly being a “drug dealer.” Now, we know we all responded to these allegations roughly according to our political inclinations. The Congress supporters probably swallowed them without asking any questions. The right-wing was more circumspect, although it probably insisted that supporting Akalis was a small price to pay to strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Modi. The wider public was probably somewhere in between. But the thing is : we all believed Kejriwal’s allegations at some level. After all, we know that the world of politics is dark and murky. Mass media was only too happy to fuel the illusion. Movies were made to cultivate, sustain and deepen the impression that Punjab is suffering a drug menace and that the ruling Akalis are feeding it. In course of time, the election in Punjab came along. Again, the media fed us fantastic stories of how Akalis had been wiped out of the contest, fanciful stories of humongous, delirious crowds at AAP rallies. The impression that was given out was that of an election being fought between Congress and AAP, with Akalis reduced to non-players, even vote cutters. The key aims had all been achieved : (1) Huge negative perception created in the public and even right wingers about the Akali-BJP government in Punjab. (2) Complete demoralization of Akali-BJP workers on the ground, who thought they were fighting for second place, rather than trying to win. (3) This attitude filtering into the electorate, who began to wonder if voting for Akali-BJP would be wasted votes. On March 11, 2017 when the results came out, I remember a liberal TV anchor asking if BJP workers were also “celebrating” the results in Punjab. Why? Because AAP didn’t win. There was probably a decent amount of truth in what the anchor said, especially if you go by the sentiment on social media. A number of right-wingers expressed relief that Congress had won Punjab instead of AAP! What a situation to be in for supporters of BJP! The duo of Modi-Shah has created in their supporters such a ruthless, such a relentless hunger for victory that they don’t give up even on Nagaland. At the same time as the BJP is winning a historic victory in Tripura, BJP supporters anxiously watch the scoreboard in Nagaland. Once it is clear that Nagaland is in the bag, they do not rest easy until it becomes known that BJP will also be part of the government in Meghalaya. This is the new culture of BJP, where winning becomes the new baseline expectation. In such a backdrop, the fraud of Punjab was pulled off superbly, like a well-oiled scam, reducing BJP supporters to celebrating a Congress victory. In hindsight (which is forever 20-20) we can now see just how well the ecosystem pulled off the Punjab scam on all of us. A myth of “drug menace” was manufactured in Punjab along with a vicious rumor about a prominent Akali minister being a drug dealer. The punches were being thrown at the Akali-BJP government not from the discredited Congress Party, but from AAP which was set up to be a decoy. The BJP supporters were then baited into attacking this decoy, which was suddenly the main enemy. The media screamed from the rooftops that the decoy was winning the battle. Even to BJP supporters, suddenly the bad old Congress party didn’t seem so bad at all. Because of the decoy. But this decoy was never in the fight and never intended to be. Worse, there was fear that this decoy was conspiring with Khalistanis. Some of the urban Hindu vote in Punjab was terrified into polarizing in favor of Congress. But the decoy wasn’t even fighting. It was just placed in the electoral battlefield, playing with hidden fears of Akali-BJP supporters, causing their minds to play tricks on them. Then, the election happened. Like a Nigerian email scamster, Kejriwal dismantled the decoy, wrapped it up and disappeared. Since that day, no one has heard a squeak, not from Kejriwal, not from a journalist nor an intellectual about the drug menace in Punjab. This is exactly what happens after you send some money to help the “prince” in Nigeria who was in danger of getting murdered by the generals who had betrayed his father the king. You never hear from them again. There was no king, there were no generals, there was no prince in exile and there was no treasure chest. Just like there was no minister in Punjab running a drug cartel. But, a true conman is someone who sees himself as an artist and takes pride in his work. This is why Kejriwal has resurfaced almost exactly a year after the results in Punjab with a letter. He is not apologizing to Majithia, he is rubbing it into our faces. He is reminding us of how we all fell for his trick. We can laugh about it, but the joke is ultimately on us.",2018-03-17,"Analysis,apology,Arvind Kejriwal,BJP,defamation,Drugs,ecosystem,Elections,Media,Punjab","Kejriwal’s apology is not funny, because the joke is on us",https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/arvind-kejriwal-apology-to-majithia-is-slap-to-common-man/
698,Sanghamitra,"Yesterday Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj announced  in Rajya Sabha that the 39 Indians missing in Iraq were confirmed to be dead. 39 of our citizens were killed by ISIS. As expected the opposition and the media soon went into a spin overdrive. The media started quoting the family members of the victims on why they were not informed before and why the government kept on giving them false hope. One media house quoted a victim’s kin saying, ‘we were made to undergo DNA tests’. Media even started quoting Harjit Masih, the lone survivor who had escaped under a Muslim name and false identity declaring that he had already told they were dead. The eloquent Shashi Tharoor  joined in too. Though the MEA explained the long and arduous process the ministry, especially MoS General VK Singh went through to trace those people and establish without a shred of doubt that they were, in fact, dead is being convincingly ignored by the media and the opposition both. ‘Dead’ is a finality. An absolution. The ministry of external affairs made sure that it has exhausted all resources, availed all means of investigations and employed every possible verification process before they arrived into that absolution and finality of announcing someone’s dear one ‘dead’. Sushma Swaraj and her team are heroes. ISIS took control  of Mosul in June 2014. Days after that, Indian officials in Iraq informed that they have lost contacts with the 40 Indian citizens employed in Mosul in a construction project. In July 2014, 46 nurses in Tikrit were set free. This further raised hope of those 40 workers being alive too. In May 2015, almost a year later, Harjit Masih claimed he was a lone survivor and the others were shot dead. Despite media repeatedly giving Masih his ‘didn’t I say so’ moment, the fact remains that he lied. Harjit Masih told the press that all Indian workers were taken to a jungle and shot. That was not true. He had escaped with the 55 Bangladeshi workers using a fake name. A fake Muslim name. Interestingly, that is one angle none of the opposition or media is willing to discuss. The uncomfortable truth: ISIS set Muslims free and killed non-Muslims in cold blood. The fact is, the other 39 Indians were not shot as Masih claimed. They were taken to a prison in Badush near Mosul. When PM Modi met the Palestinian President Mehmood Abbas in New York he was informed that the Indians might be alive. The government of India had also heard from other sources that they were still alive. As of July 2016, Ms Swaraj had information  that they were alive and being used as bonded labour for construction and farm work by ISIS. The above is a picture of how mass graves in Iraq looked like. Imagine tracing the movements and final known location of individuals when Mosul had fallen. Going to the war-torn and chaotic Iraq to convince the authorities to spare personnel and resources to trace the possible locations of Indian who might have been there. Then contacting and pursuing the concerned authorities and individuals working in those mass graves and finalise the possible locations, all the above-mentioned things is what General VK Singh went through to finally conclude that the mound at Badush may contain the bodies of the Indian workers. All this was possible only after July 10, 2017. When Mosul was liberated from ISIS. When VK Singh  went to Badush with Iraqi authorities, they were informed by locals about a mound where a mass grave was expected. With the help of Iraqi officials , the mound was exhumed and several remains were discovered. The presence of some ID cards, long hair, kadas (bracelet) and non-Iraqi made shoes suggested they might have belonged to Indians and so the bodies were sent to Baghdad. The martyr’s foundation in Iraq asked for DNA samples from relatives of the victims to confirm identity. After identity was finally established and informed to the Indian government, then only Sushma Swaraj informed in the Parliament about the death of those 39 people. Sushma Swaraj had mentioned the difficulties the MEA had to encounter for confirmation. Iraq was and is in chaos. We Indians should consider ourselves fortunate to have an MEA like Ms Swaraj who did not give up. Unlike the UPA government who gave up on Sarabjit Singh , this government is still fighting for Kulbhushan Jadhav . The people who are questioning the government’s intention should question themselves. There are numerous instances  where forgotten Indian soldiers were later found to be alive. Sepoy Jaspal Singh who fought in 71 war was later found to be languishing in Oman jail. What is most disheartening in this whole case is how conveniently the Indian media and Congress, in particular, are deliberately ignoring to condemn and point out the very reason the 39 Indians are dead, the ISIS. None of the Congress leaders who have been vocally criticising the government after the announcement yesterday has condemned the ISIS so far. None so far have discussed the brutality of Islamic terrorism. The story of the 39 Indians killed in Iraq is tragic. They went there looking for work There were reports that they had paid middlemen and agents lakhs of rupees to go and work in Iraq. Such was the necessity of employment that they even ignored the warnings by Indian and Iraqi officials to leave the country. While they worked in prison they might even have hoped that the ISIS would set them free. There are a dozen tragic tales of poverty, lack of jobs and exploitations here. But blaming the government for lack of efforts or lack of intent is absolutely wrong. General VK Singh will soon leave for Baghdad to bring the last remains of the 39 people back home. That will be a finality. Their families will never have the joy of their presence but the MEAs relentless efforts will give them closure. Sushma Swaraj and her staff have left no effort spared in establishing confirmation of their deaths. She had stated again and again that she won’t declare them dead until it has been conclusively established and she deserves our applause, for not letting go, for not giving up. Regardless of what the media portrays, the family of a person never truly believes their loved one is dead until they see conclusive evidence. Sushma Swaraj has done the same. She kept hopes and efforts alive till the last moment. The MEA deserves our salute.",2018-03-21,"Congress,EAM Sushma Swaraj,Iraq,ISIS,Mosul,Parliament,rahul gandhi,sushma swaraj,VK Singh","Dear Congress, ISIS is the villain here, not Sushma Swaraj",https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/dear-congress-isis-is-the-villain-here-not-sushma-swaraj/
699,Nithesh S,"The bureaucracy in India has been bashed for most of the ills in Indian society. However, one of the areas where they are doing pretty well is in the Election Commission. From time to time they have evolved the system and come up with a framework where free and fair elections can be held in the country. One of the key parts of the fair election system in India is its unique innovation i.e. electronic voting machine. The Congress plenary  in its political resolution  has proposed a return to the paper ballots in future elections to restore the ‘credibility  of elections’. The reason for this may have dubious motives behind it. This claim would raise questions the validity of the results in previous elections where Congress won. When the ECI called for an ‘EVM challenge’, asking all parties to demonstrate the faults of EVMs in June 2017, none were able to prove a fault in the device. The Congress has been making wild allegations on EVMs and politicising it. In December 2017, the party had linked EVM fraud with a hypothetical GSPC scam. The hit and run strategy of the party that demonstrates how irrelevant it is becoming day by day. In spite of the ridiculous and unfounded comments of the opposition, the BJP has not ruled out the proposal. The BJP general secretary has said that the party was ready to examine the proposal if there is a consensus on the matter. However, it would be a blunder if BJP were to accept the scrapping of one of the finest electoral reforms in the world. One would be curious to know the process by which this system came into being and evolved over the years. The Election Commission has recently brought out a status paper [pdf ] on EVMs. It highlights the improvements, benefits and clarifies concerns if any on the EVM. The paper includes detailed safety provisions, legal aspects, international comparisons and an assessment of some recent controversies. The paper makes a strong defence of the EVM and assures that further improvements will also be accepted. The brief history of EVM is summarised in the paper as below. A general consensus on the use of EVMs has arrived twenty years ago in 1998. The Congress party was an integral part of this process throughout. Today it is retracting its own support to EVMs. Probably this is due to its failure in successive assembly elections. 
 The benefits of using EVMs and disadvantages of using paper ballots are well known. However, it is summarised by EC in its paper succinctly. The paper says (emphasis added) : It is quite clear as to why parties like Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress and Aam Admi Party are afraid of EVM. EVMs enable the poorest of poor and most illiterate to vote in a simple manner. The device eliminates the possibility of many election frauds (like rigging and booth capture).

These parties want to take us back to an age where casteism, communalism and regressive agenda of divide and rule dominate. Therefore they will continue to oppose anything that is progressive.

700,OpIndia Staff,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi somewhat looked like making a fool of himself  in Singapore, while having a panel discussion at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on Thursday. Apart from making odd statements about connecting all MRI machines, he was also seen counter questioning the audience to possibly try and avoid answering them. Since the panel interview also involved the audience interacting with Rahul, it saw some of the attendees asking tough questions to the Congress President, which of all people, angered controversial journalist  Sagarika Ghose. The person in question Prasenjit K. Basu posed a question  to Rahul asking him why did India’s per capita income grow slower as compared to the world when “his family” was in power. He followed it up by asking why did the per capita income see a much faster growth soon after Rahul’s family relinquished the Prime Ministerial position of the country. A video of the exchange was tweeted by netizen Vivek Shetty: As seen above, rather than properly answering the question, Rahul proceeded to ask a condescending counter question. When Mr Basu later schooled Rahul on economic principles, it was met with an uneasy attempt on part of the dynast to come up with an answer. Later the official Twitter account of the Congress party decided to put out an edited video to cut short Mr Basu and Rahul’s exchange to possibly mitigate the embarrassment of their leader. This was strongly objected to by Mr. Basu, who even threatened  legal action for the same. With Rahul’s gaffes going viral on social media, a spokesperson for the party too decided to start damage control by predictably taking refuge under the garb of liberalism: Even though Sanjay Jha had merely sung Rahul Gandhi’s praises, Sagarika Ghose decided to use it as a plank to launch an abusive, elitist and anti-Hindu tirade against Mr Basu: Such an act of Sagarika which also involved deriding the Hindu epic Ramayana, predictably drew out reactions from people: Such a slave like response by Ms Ghose might shed the light on the operating procedure of the so-called neutral journalists, who are seen going to extreme extents in a bid to maintain their and their “master’s” hegemony, all under the garb of neutrality, liberalism and political correctness. But when such tactics don’t work, they are seen shedding their masks and exposing their deep contempt for the Hindu culture and the beliefs of the masses.",2018-03-09,"abuse,Congress,questions,rahul gandhi,Sagarika Ghose,Social Media,Twitter,Twitter India",Sagarika Ghose abuses an author who asked Rahul Gandhi a tough question in Singapore,https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/sagarika-ghose-abuses-author-asking-tough-questions-rahul-gandhi-singapore/
701,K Bhattacharjee,"The Congress Party has time and again displayed in the past the sheer disconnect with the ground realities of India. On the occasion of International Women’s Day, the official twitter handle of the the Congress Party decided to conduct a poll that asked women to state how they planned to celebrate the day. The options were ‘drinking what you love’ (an obvious allusion to alcohol), ‘laughing out loudly’ (an allusion the time when Renuka Chaudhary was mocked for laughing hysterically during Narendra Modi’s speech in the Parliament), ‘late night loitering’ and ‘all of the above’. One can truly appreciate the depravity of the times we live in when one realizes that equality between the sexes has been interpreted as women consuming alcohol, laughing hysterically on occasions that demand seriousness, with no consideration for proper etiquette, and loitering on the streets. When so many campaigns are run to discourage people from consuming alcohol, the largest opposition party in the country thinks it is appropriate to celebrate women consuming alcohol. Of course, women should have the liberty to consume alcohol should they choose to, however, it is highly reprehensible that a political party thinks consuming alcohol is an integral feature of women empowerment. The extent to which the priorities of modern feminists are misplaced can be truly gauged by their utter lack of concern for the poor women and the downtrodden for whom mere survival is an ordeal. The housewife, the mother, the ordinary working woman does not consider any of the priorities of the feminists as essential for them. Crores of women have received free LPG connections through the Ujwala Yojana of the NDA government, millions of free electricity connections are being provided to families, criminals are being eliminated at a rapid pace by the Uttar Pradesh government under Yogi Adityanath. So, who has done more for women empowerment? Modern feminists who constantly whine on social media because their feelings have been hurt or these ‘Patriarchal Hindu males’? The social media cell of the Congress Party insinuates that women will somehow throw the shackles set on them by Patriarchy by consuming alcohol, laughing like maniacs and loitering on the streets. Well, I am not sure about throwing off shackles but they will certainly be harming their liver, considered by everyone around them as an ill-mannered brat and waste a considerable amount of time which could have otherwise been spent in more productive pursuits. And really, women are not banned from consuming alcohol. They can still drink should they choose to. But what exactly is the Congress party trying to achieve by presenting the consumption of alcohol as a noble pursuit? Everyone who drinks alcohol would agree with me when I say that consumption of alcohol is not something to be encouraged, for men or women and that consuming alcohol to celebrate Women’s Day or ‘Fight the Patriarchy’ is stupid at best and an indication of psychological instability at worst. The official twitter handle of the Karnataka unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party strongly condemned the Congress’ tweet. Of course, people were not pleased either with the Congress party and let their opinions known on social media. The Congress Party has become immensely disconnected with the aspirations, ambitions and the concerns of our countrymen. What perhaps makes this poll worse, is that the Congress’ social media pursuits are run by a woman, Divya Spandana. The one credited with the nonexistent “revival of Rahul Gandhi” on Social Media. The one who has been hailed as a symbol of woman empowerment. For her to condone reducing woman empowerment to such caricatural proportions is shameful.",2018-03-08,"Congress,women's day",The Congress party reduces women empowerment to a caricature on International Women’s Day,https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/international-womens-day-2018-congress-twitter-reduces-empowerment-to-a-joke/
702,OpIndia Staff,"In Singapore, Rahul Gandhi came up with the idea of connecting all MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines or scanners, and since then the internet is trying to decipher what exactly he meant and how is that going to help the humanity. Rahul Gandhi had said that the entire healthcare sector on the planet would be transformed if all the MRIs were connected. A comment that initially drew nothing but laughter has now been turned into something that is in fact intellectually valid and visionary in nature. Some dynasty fans went on to say that those mocking Rahul Gandhi were morons and had no legitimacy to speak on this topic: While most of the commentators trying to rationalise what Rahul Gandhi said, had no domain knowledge themselves and were aligned to the Congress party or Congress-left ecosystem, some neutral observers too explained that some research in collating and understanding data of MRIs was underway. However, it was not clear if Rahul Gandhi is aware of these scientific developments: So did Rahul Gandhi really suggest a scientifically or technologically critical and novel idea? It depends on the benefit of doubt you are willing to give Rahul Gandhi for his intelligence and knowledge. However, an interesting information that has come out in this debate, is that a part of the wisdom — which depends upon how liberally and favourably you are willing to interpret Congress President’s statement — demonstrated by Rahul Gandhi was already executed by Narendra Modi more than ten years ago when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. The information came out when a doctor and a commentator-on-all-things got into a debate on Twitter over Rahul Gandhi’s statement, where the commentator-on-all-things was trying to mock Narendra Modi supporters. The doctor revealed that he had already participated in a pilot program on the digitisation of health records in Gujarat: The document on Hospital Management Information Services [pdf ] shows that these ideas had been pursued years before the dynastic scion came up with his brilliant idea. Such a system was pursued  as early as 2006 in Gujarat. The first paragraph of the executive summary of this report says: So Rahul Gandhi might appear to have a point, but he never made that point. The theories put forward by Gandhi’s supporters and opportunistic fence-sitters are incoherent to say the least, especially when Rahul Gandhi did not explain about what his idea of connecting MRIs was. This appears to be a classic case of drawing a target after the arrow has landed on a spot.",2018-03-10,"debate,gujarat,Healthcare,Listicle,MRI,Narendra Modi,Politics,rahul gandhi,Technology,Twitter",Congress fans scan Rahul Gandhi’s brain to interpret what he meant by ‘connecting MRI machines’,https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/congress-activists-paint-rahul-gandhi-intelligent-on-mri/
703,Sanghamitra,"Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhary, or rather, her laughter is back in the ‘news’ again. Renuka Chowdhary was shot to media attention recently when she laughed hysterically during the Prime Minister’s speech and the PM joked that he had heard such a laughter for the first time after Ramayana  serial. Renuka Chowdhary, according to reports has unleashed her laughter again. This time, however, it was in between a high-level party meeting called by Congress President Rahul Gandhi. Here is a refreshing reminder of that laugh inside Rajya Sabha: According to “reports”, recently Congress President Rahul Gandhi had held a high-level party meeting where Renuka, being a senior Congress leader, was also invited. Rahul was speaking about the grim situation the party is in currently. He of course had Pidi sitting quietly and patiently in his lap. He added that the party leaders would have to ‘give their best’ to overcome the hardships. Right then, Renuka Chowdhary laughed at full throttle, again. A Congress leader, on conditions of anonymity, has stated that Renuka’s laughter was met with by stunned silence by other attendees. Pidi too cocked his little head to the right and couldn’t believe what had just happened. The Congress President, seeing that reaction, reportedly sat down abruptly without finishing his talk. Renuka Chowdhary however, continued her famous laugh. She stopped it after some precious moments but it was too late. Renuka soon realised her ‘mistake’ and came out of the meeting. But as per the anonymous Congress leader, Rahul baba has taken offence to the laughter. The Congress leaders have been pretty displeased and Rahul Gandhi has even hinted that Renuka should not be there in party meetings after it. In fact, we are told he might soon be taking a vacation just to get away from the haunting sounds of that thunderous laugh. Congress leaders have told us in confidence how Rahul’s eyes became bloodshot while he clutched on to Pidi for moral support. In fact, Rahul has planned a visit to see his naani just to get some solace from the crackling sounds that won’t let him sleep at night. When Renuka Chowdhary laughed during the PM’s address the whole Congress supporting ecosystem  jumped to her defence. They even hailed Surpanakha as the heroine of the tragic saga of misunderstood feminism. Here are some gems:   Feminist journalists asserted that as male parliamentarians are known to create a ruckus in the house, Renuka Chowdhary has all the right to laugh however loud she wants to when the PM is making a speech. Hail women power! Congress’s own spokesperson stood up for Renuka’s right to cackle too. Even the Congress party itself has condemned the PM’s jibe and called it derogatory . There were hosts of ‘feminist’ articles calling for a woman’s right to laugh and ‘patriarchy’s’ centuries-old attempt to suppress laughing women. Will Renuka Chowdhary have the same kind of support this time around too? Many Congress leaders are blamed for being hypocritical. At least Renuka Chowdhary has shown now that her laughter does not discriminate. She has laughed on camera, press briefings, in Parliament and now even in between Rahul Gandhi’s meeting too. She sure is one fearless woman who laughs without hesitation or regard to any ‘rules’ and cultural impositions by the ‘patriarchal’ society. Woman power comes from laughing in between serious statements in important events. We could now just LLRC (laugh like Renuka Chowdhury) at the entire chain of events.

704,K Bhattacharjee,"In a shock result, Samajwadi Party is set to win  the by-poll in the traditional BJP stronghold and Yogi Adityanath’s erstwhile Parliamentary constituency, Gorakhpur. To make matters worse, BJP has lost the other seat in Uttar Pradesh, previously held by KP Maurya, as well. Thus in one shot, the CM and Deputy CM’s constituencies have delivered blows to the BJP. The alarm bells should have started ringing when the by-polls recorded a low turnout in both the seats in Uttar Pradesh that went into polls. Gorakhpur registered  a voter turnout of merely 47.45%. In 2014, Gorakhpur had seen a 54.64% turnout, and in the in the Assembly elections, Gorakhpur Urban had registered a turnout of 50.98% The story is worse off in Phulpur which saw an even lower, 37.39% turnout this time around. It had recorded a 50.20% turnout for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Phulpur though is less of a loss for BJP as the seat until 2014 had never been won by the BJP. The results will come as a huge boost to the opposition ahead of the 2019 general elections. The most obvious reasons for the defeat could be the SP-BSP alliance which was tentatively tested for the first time in these by-polls. With results emerging quite favourable towards them, a lot better than even they expected, it may provide the template for a Mahagathbandhan style alliance in Uttar Pradesh, which contributes 80 seats for the Lok Sabha elections. The biggest cause of concern for the BJP, however, will be the fact that for the first time since the ascent of Narendra Modi, the consolidation of Hindu votes across all castes, which helped the saffron party reach great heights, appears to have been broken. A Mahagathbandhan in Uttar Pradesh might prove to be difficult to counter and Amit Shah will have to use all the ingenuity at his disposal towards winning a significant number of seats in 2019. Like the last time around, Amit Shah might well end up deciding to park his bus at Uttar Pradesh months before the country goes to polls. But could the BJP have done better? Possibly. The low turnouts indicate the BJP’s failure to motivate the voters to go out on poll-day. While it has to be admitted that even the voters do not take by-polls very seriously as they hardly ever affect the grander scheme of things, it is ultimately the duty of the cadre to inspire people to vote for them. The low voter turnout indicates that the cadres either grew complacent after recent electoral triumphs and probably a bit arrogant as well. The tremendously reputed Panna Pramukhs and the micro level management by the cadres which was credited with victories must now accept its share of the blame. A loss for BJP in a seat Yogi Adityanath has held for two decades on his own cannot be glossed over and makes for some very bad optics. Coming on the back of BJP’s stunning performance in the North East, the local unit cannot blame “national mood” as well. The loss and the blame for it become highly localised. Selection of candidate must also be scrutinised since the BJP fielded Upendra Shukla, a man belonging to an upper caste, in a constituency dominated  by people from backward castes which has proven to be counter-intuitive. However, drawing out state and nation wide predictions from 2 by-polls which were numerically insignificant may prove fool-hardy. Some opposition cheerleaders are getting overexcited and threatening bureaucrats  working for the NDA government, assuming already that the BJP has lost the 2019 general elections. Such people will be well advised to exercise caution for now. The fact remains that the BJP has scored thunderous victories across the country in Assembly elections. The by-polls, if anything, could prove to be mere blip on the radar. The populace is known to vote differently when the stakes are high. These by-polls were nothing more than a show of prestige as a loss would not impact any Government anywhere. Having said that, the local BJP set-up must introspect and look into the reasons why the sitting CM and Deputy CMs could not salvage their seats in a by-poll coming just a year after their Government was formed.",2018-03-14,"Analysis,BJP,by-polls,caste politics,Elections,gorakhpur,Politics,samajwadi party,Yogi Adityanath","Unfavourable arithmetic aside, BJP must learn these lessons from UP by-polls",https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/unfavourable-arithmetic-aside-bjp-must-learn-these-lessons-from-up-by-polls/

Here are some of the tweets which caught our attention: Karnataka Congress recently put out a series of tweets called ‘Yeddyurappa for Dummies’, in an attempt to mock BJP Karnataka President. To that, the BJP Karnataka’s official Twitter  handle gave stinging rebuttals. In the first post in the series, INC Karnataka had accused Yeddyurappa of corruption stating that he was sent to prison for ‘accepting bribes’. In their own words, BJP Karnataka hit the ball out of the park. BJP Karnataka went on to explain to Congress President Rahul Gandhi the difference between judicial custody and jail upon conviction, with an example. If that wasn’t enough, they gave another example, something that might help him understand the situation better, considering he was the subject. The second point raised by Karnataka Congress was accusing Yeddyurappa of being anti-farmer. To that, BJP Karnataka quipped and reminded Congress of the number of farmers who committed suicide during Siddaramaiah regime. Then they accused Yeddyurappa with financial instability claiming how he mismanaged Karnataka’s finances and Siddaramaiah had to pay off those loans. BJP Karnataka, however, was ready with a comeback. They counter-accused Siddaramaiah of incurring more debt in the five years he has been the chief minister of Karnataka than the all previous chief ministers combined, taking debt per Kannadiga to Rs. 44,769.

708,Nirwa Mehta,"It is often said Politics is a man’s world. It is a “dirty profession” and there is no place for “honourable women” in this world of politics. Initially, perhaps public perception changed slightly with the only woman in politics then. Indira Gandhi. The ‘iron woman’ of India. Or the only ‘man’ in the Indian Government. The one who had the ‘courage’ to take on Pakistan. Barring the difference in core political ideology, Indira Gandhi certainly was a woman of steel who changed how the country viewed women’s place in modern politics. However, it is tragic that many other women, who in their own way stood toe to toe with men in politics, were sidelined by the pages of history. Growing up, I knew Anandiben Patel, former Chief Minister of Gujarat and also the Education Minister of Gujarat. She was the only woman I had heard of in politics back then. I started observing Indian politics 2004 onwards. It was the same year when ironically, as Anandiben Patel surged ahead in a man’s world, Sonia Gandhi did the “janana thing” by paying heed to her ‘ It took 70 years after independence in India for a woman fighter pilot to soar  the skies solo. Hence when we are breaking the glass ceiling for women in India every other day, it is heartening to know that in the Indian government, three of the major ministries in the cabinet are headed by women. The work they do will be judged by history. What we can admire today, is what they signify. What their position in the Government means for women in India. A personal favourite. If there is one thing I wish to do, is to work under her someday. When she is not strengthening diplomatic relations with foreign countries, she is busy rescuing distressed Indians stranded abroad. In 1973, at the age of 21, she was an advocate in the Supreme Court of India. During the Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Swaraj, along with her husband Swaraj Kaushal was part of the team defending George Fernandes. Strangely, it is still Indira Gandhi who became the “iron lady” without so much as a whisper about Sushma Swaraj or many like her. She was also the first female Chief Minister of Delhi. I, of course, enjoy her witty quips on Twitter where she shows that politicians have a sense of humour, too. Credit here must also be given to her husband, Swaraj Kaushal, who can very well match up to his wife’s wit. Being first  full-time woman Defence Minister of India says something about her grit. Prior to her, only Indira Gandhi held the portfolio, which she had allocated to herself when she was the Prime Minister of India. A Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) graduate, Sitharaman holds an MA in Economics and served as an assistant to Economist in the Agricultural Engineers Association in the UK. She also worked Price Waterhouse during her stay in the UK. As Raksha Mantri, she has led from the front, whether it is interacting  with the MiG 29k pilots and sailors or greeting  the Chinese soldiers at the India-China border at Nathu La. Makes one feel we are in safe hands. From an actor to a politician, Irani has transitioned so well that she is an inspiration. As Minister of Textiles, she heads an industry which is one of the highest providers of employment, direct and indirect. As someone who faces sexist and offensive abuses on a regular basis, she gives it back  as good as she gets. Today, as we celebrate Women’s Day, here’s raising a toast to the women on top in Indian politics. The women who stand toe to toe with the most powerful men in the world and say “I AM”. To the women who bring hope to all the little girls who would have never thought of joining, and excelling, in the “dirty field of politics”. The women who rule.

At Belonia town in Tripura, stood a statue of Russian communist leader Vladimir Lenin, who served as head of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924. Within 48 hours of the verdict in Tripura, BJP workers and supporters thronged the centre of College Square and brought  down the Lenin statue that stood there for the past 5 years, chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jai. As soon as the images of Lenin’s statue falling went viral on social media, Twitter users donned their creativity cap and brought out these hilarious memes on the fall of Lenin in Tripura. Here are some of them. One Twitter user even brought back the magical telekinesis powers of AAP leader Ashutosh. Last year in August, the elected government in Ukraine removed  1,320 statues of Lenin from every town and village, in an attempt to get rid of all Soviet-era symbols. In fact, a street named Lenin Street was renamed to Lennon Street, as a tribute to the Beatles. In 1991, two days after Ethiopia’s ruthless dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, fled in a plane, Lenin giant statue was brought  down. Meanwhile, India still has statues of Lenin in Kolkata, Vijaywada and Delhi. The statue will be removed by police and given to municipality for storage. Meanwhile, the driver of the bulldozer, Ashish Pal, has been arrested  and let off on bail.",2018-03-06,"BJP,communists,Election results,Fun,humour,lenin,Listicle,manik sarkar,Tripura,Tripura Assembly election,Twitter,twitterati","Tripura: Lenin statue brought down, check out these hilarious reactions",https://www.opindia.com/2018/03/tripura-lenin-statue-brought-down-check-out-these-hilarious-reactions/
713,Nithesh S,"Mr Kachori: Good morning comrades. I thank all of you for putting forward your views. I have noted down your suggestions. It is indeed tragic that a strong left bastion has fallen. I have somehow managed to save our image in the media by telling Bharatiya Jingoistic Party has won because of money power. But we must seriously introspect on this loss. I know that our counterparts in China are doing an awesome job. But you must be aware that there is a certain amount of meritocracy in Chinese communist party. We can’t allow such a thing here. So we will have to figure out the way forward. Manik Bekar: I take personal responsibility for this loss. R YES YES was campaigning right under my nose. But I did know that a larger number of  them were operating in the state. Prakash Carrot : No point in pondering about what you could not do Mr Bekar. You have put us in a precarious position. I need to check with the party treasurer about our financial health now. I am afraid, we need to seriously cut down on our expenditures for the next few years. Mr Kachori : That is indeed true. I will have to start using capitalist Uber company’s services for next few years for commuting in metropolises. I can’t manage my expenses with meagre Rajya Sabha pension. I am forseeing a day when I will have to downgrade my internet data plan. Pinarayi Ajayan: Mr Kachori and comrades, please don’t feel helpless. Please remember that Kerala still is under our grip. Mr Bekar, I will forward you some of the you-know-whats we managed to do in my state. Might serve as a reference. Brinda Carrot : But what went wrong with the people. How can they fall into the R YES YES propaganda trap. Who is the Sunil deodorant? Bekar saab, you should have highlighted major red flags in previous meetings. Manik Bekar : That was punny, Mrs Carrot. I was confident about the devotion our people had for communist ideology. R YES YES people were given the you-know-what treatment. But, you should also ensure that the fear factor must not cross a certain threshold. You are well aware of this policy of ours Mrs Carrot. We cannot afford to loose the entire narrative to R YES YES and Bharatiya Jingoistic Party propaganda. Sitaram Kachori : We are digressing a bit. Now we must discuss two other important points raised by our comrades. Should we embrace market economics like our Chinese counterparts have done? And secondly, I know Mr Carrot will vehemently oppose me, should we ally with Khangress party in future elections? These are two important issues. Mr Ajayan can pitch in about any other interesting suggestions as he is the only Chief minister we have right now. Pinarayi Ajayan : See Mr Kachori, Khangress is an opponent in my state. You must remember that. If this stupid idea of yours is accepted publicly, I will lose my god, nay, Lenin damn CM position in next election. Khangress can be tacitly supported outside, but we cannot afford to do that in the only left leaning state of India. Also, please ditch your capitalist dreams Mr Kachori. North Korea and Cuba are still doing fine without Capitalist nonsense. Prakash Carrot : Indeed. Look at our fellow comrades. They have nuclear weapons now. South Korea is pissing in its pants and now negotiating with Kim Jong Un. Sitaram Kachori : Ok Comrades. Xi Jingping will be disappointed when I report to him in a scheduled video conference this evening. I may have differences. Yes it is pissing off sometimes, but I have to stick with all of you. I hate to use the term that R YES YES guys often resort to. This is my Karma. Brinda Carrot : Awww. Don’t feel so bad Mr Kachori. We need to stay together in these difficult times. We can’t jeopardize the position of Mr Pinarayi Ajayan in the only leftist state that is left in India. Pinarayi Ajayan : Mr Kachori, I am aware of the financial difficulties in the party. I can form some advisory committee in my state and give all of you some job. Like Sonia Ghandy’s National Armchair Council. Prakash Carrot : That is a good idea, but I feel that is not the top priority item Mr. Ajayan. We need to strengthen the party and remain committed to ideology. Khangress is pro-capitalism and pro-America. I feel very very angry about these people. Sitaram Kachori : Ok then. Comrades. This was a good meeting. I agree with Mr Carrot. Top priority must be given to rejuvenating the party. I think we should call it a wrap now.

Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha tweeted in defence of Karti saying that the fact that he returned from London (surprising to see London being a favourite hangout place for those accused of fraud, like Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi), but others, get a ‘VIP sendoff’. By his tweet, does Jha mean that Karti is in the same league as Mallaya and Nirav Modi and others accused of swindling crores of rupees? People even pointed it out to him that this could imply an admission of guilt, in a way. Some even wondered if Karti was just thrown under the bus to save The Family?

716,OpIndia Staff,"BJP President Amit Shah today made his debut speech in the Rajya Sabha. He hailed the current NDA government’s successes in creating Jan Dhan accounts and improving the living standards of the people of India through electrification, digitisation and development of infrastructure. He stated that the Narendra Modi led BJP government has created 31 crore Jan Dhan accounts and extended electricity to 16,000 out of 18,000 villages. He also applauded  the government’s direct benefit transfer and ‘Khelo India’ initiatives. He spoke about his government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers and praised the central government for effective handling of Kashmir issue. The BJP President slammed Congress for its failure to address the people’s problems in all the years that it remained in power. He said that he accepts unemployment is a problem in a country but Congress should remember that we are facing this problem even after decades of Congress rule. He tore into the recent remarks  of ex-finance minister P. Chidambaram where he had compared pakoda sellers to beggars. Amit Shah went ahead to add that it is better to be a pakoda seller than becoming a beggar. He said that it was the shameful mentality of Congress to mock the countless young men who are working hard  to become self-employed by starting small businesses. He also praised the GST reform and said once the initial troubles are addressed it will be immensely beneficial to the country’s economy. He attacked  Rahul Gandhi’s jibe  on GST as ‘Gabbar Singh Tax’ and said how can a legal economic reform be compared to a dacoit in a Bollywood film. He went on to remark that public sentiment is expressed best by electoral mandates and it is because of the Indian people’s satisfaction with the central government that after forming the government in the centre in 2014, BJP has gone ahead to win several state assembly elections with an overwhelming majority. He added that the BJP wants to uproot 3 major problems in the democratic system of the country. Those are dynasty politics, casteism and appeasement , and PM Modi has ensured that these 3 problems are uprooted. In an attack to the Congress party’s tradition of dynasty politics, he added that for 55 years a single family had ruled over the country and still 60% of the people did not have bank accounts. He assured that the Modi government doing its best for the upliftment of the poor and downtrodden. Amit Shah also mocked the Congress for its ‘moral victory ‘ propaganda after losing Gujrat elections. He told that even after ruling for 22 years the BJP still can come to power for another 5 years and if Congress is calling it a moral victory, he can not do anything about it.

718,OpIndia Staff,"The Chief Minister of Tripura, Manik Sarkar, on Tuesday, accused the BJP of trying to wipe off Tripura from the map. He has deemed the alliance between IPFT and BJP to be “unholy” and called it a conspiracy to against the state itself. The Chief Minister also accused the BJP of inciting disturbances across the nation and failing to address issues related to the economy. According to him, “Achchhey din” isn’t here and wrongly  claimed that inflation is at an all-time high. The NDA government has been remarkably adept at controlling inflation and inflation rates are much lower now than they were under the UPA. Taking a leaf out of Rahul Gandhi’s book, Manik Sarkar accused the NDA government of trying to solely help the corporate even at the expense of the poor of the country.

719,Abhishek Banerjee,"Yesterday, at PM Modi’s special event for “exam warriors,” one Girish Singh, a Class XI student from Delhi asked the Prime Minister the following question (rough paraphrase): I really wanted to listen. And the crux of the answer brought tears to my eyes. After some general remarks regarding karma, hard work and optimism, the Prime Minister said (again, slight paraphrase) “ You may not be a BJP supporter. You may be a supporter of Congress. Or even some regional party. Perhaps you are not even interested in politics. But you know that there is a lesson to be learnt there. What is your dream in life? Perhaps you are a student preparing for Board Exams. Do you dream of going to IIT and getting a high paid job? Do you want to become a doctor? Do you dream of becoming a great scientist and winning a Nobel Prize? Do you want to become an author or a poet? It doesn’t matter. There is a lesson for you to learn from the way the BJP and the Sangh Parivar have built themselves up in India’s politics against “impossible” odds. What do I have to learn from the Congress? What do I have to learn from Rahul Gandhi? That, if my great-grandfather was rich and powerful, I don’t have to work for a day in my life? Is that supposed to be a lesson? I don’t blame Rahul Gandhi for being born into the Dynasty. Obviously, he did not choose to be born in it. But the fact remains that his life provides me with ZERO actionable lessons. He was born a privileged prince, I was born a common person. There’s literally nothing I can do with information about the life he has lived, immune to failure no matter what. If there is a lesson from Rahul baba’s life, it is roughly this:  When we were kids, every story that we heard from our elders and every story that was in our school textbooks was supposed to end in a “moral.” A common theme was something like this: the rich kid has everything in life, grows arrogant and lazy and treats everyone else poorly.  Meanwhile, poor kid works harder because he gets nothing handed to him. Finally, a day comes when the poor kid grows up and becomes much more successful than the rich kid. You could easily name lots of movies and TV serials with the same basic plot. For me, that is also the story of the BJP/RSS versus the Gandhis. No matter what the Gandhis did, every action of theirs was praised to high heaven by courtiers in media, academia and popular culture. This is not limited simply to courtiers praising Rahul Gandhi merely for taking a break from vacation to campaign somewhere, or gushing desperately to write “Rahul has come of age” every time he manages to spell his name correctly. This has been happening for decades. Let’s just ask a few simple questions: Who brought the Emergency? Congress did. But which party is repeatedly accused of being fascist? RSS/BJP! Which party runs purely on hereditary privilege? Congress. But which party do our intellectuals accuse of having a casteist and/or feudal mindset? RSS/BJP! Which party has massacred millions of people across the world? Communists. But which party is repeatedly accused of being violent? RSS/BJP. Which party made a deal with the British about dividing India? Which party presided over Partition riots that killed 30 lakh, people? Which party’s leaders were at the breakfast table of the British every day?  Who benefitted most from the deals they made with the British? All Congress! Yet, who got “credit” for the independence of India? Congress! Who got accused of riots and of conspiring with the British? Not the people who presided over Partition riots that killed 30 lakh people. Not the people who were at the breakfast table with the British Viceroy every day. But the RSS/BJP got blamed. No, seriously. Please see here Sudheendra Kulkarni’s blog  on NDTV explaining why RSS thought is the real reason for the division of India. Did you know? The Congress tried to ban the Sangh multiple times. Another example of their belief in freedom of expression. But despite all the crushing odds, the RSS/BJP survived. Just like the moral “rich kid vs poor kid” theme I was talking about. Not only did RSS/BJP survive, they thrived. And one day they stood up so high that they dwarfed the Grand Old Party of privilege. There is a lesson there. And you can learn it and apply it to your own life. Whether or not you support BJP. Right now, the Congress Party is reduced to just five Chief Ministers. There are three Assembly Elections happening right now. You would think that Rahul Gandhi would be moving mountains to capture power in those states. But, no, the rich kid doesn’t care. Rahul Gandhi made a summary appearance in Tripura yesterday, almost a formality. Who is sweating hard to win Tripura? Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. They have 14 Chief Ministers but they are fighting for more. A lesson to be learned there. Because in the Gujarat elections of December, Amit Shah, now party President, voted at the same place  where he used to be a booth worker. It is only when you know what it means to work hard and achieve the success that your life contains lessons for others. But Rahul can’t care about Tripura. It’s too small for him. It has just 2 Lok Sabha seats. But the BJP knows the value of 2 Lok Sabha seats. Back in 1984, their entire tally was just 2! One difficult day in 1958, Atalji sat down with Advaniji to his side and assured him,  You may not be a BJP supporter. But you know you can always learn something from them and strive to make your life a little better. To aim higher. To work harder. To battle the odds no matter what. And then, ask yourself: is there anything you can learn from Rahul Gandhi? Anything at all?",2018-02-18,"advani,Atal Bihari Vajpayee,BJP,Congress,Jan Sangh,Narendra Modi,Politics,rahul gandhi",Here is what I learnt from Prime Minister Modi and why I am a BJP supporter,https://www.opindia.com/2018/02/what-i-learned-from-pm-modi-and-why-i-am-a-bjp-supporter/
720,Nirwa Mehta,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has repeatedly broken protocols while receiving heads of foreign countries, did not go to receive him at the airport himself when Trudeau and his family arrived in Delhi for a seven-day trip. Instead, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Affairs received  him at the airport and his meeting with PM Modi is scheduled to take place on 23rd February. Pointing it out, Canadian columnist put out a tweet mentioning how a ‘low ranking official’ was sent to receive PM Trudeau. In her following tweets, she mentions how this could have been because of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s silence over his stand on pro-Khalistan separatists. As per Canadian media reports, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder has taken a strong  stand and refused to meet PM Trudeau, whose cabinet minister he has publicly accused of being connected to Sikh separatist movement. In April 2017, Captain Amarinder had refused  to meet Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan, a known Khalistani sympathiser, during his visit. Hence, while Modi Government has not made it explicitly clear that they are registering their reservations against the Canadian Government’s implied support to pro-separatist movement, speculations are that the BJP government is taking tough stand against Canadian government’s treatment meted out to Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder as well as their non-committal stand against pro-Khalistan separatists. Yesterday, when Trudeau visited Agra, he was received  at the airport by the district magistrate, unlike his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was received by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at the airport. While BJP government snubbed Prime Minister Trudeau for flirting with Khalistanis, Congress seems to be seeing it as an opportunity to take a dig at Prime Minister Modi. Congress social media head Divya Spandana said she would give Trudeau a hug because India loves Trudeau. She even added a hugging emoticon, probably to show how sincere her hug to Trudeau was. However, soon enough she got called out for her ‘hugplomacy’. Even journalists, who have traditionally been anti-Modi saw merit in the government’s stand, but not Congress. Not just Divya, even Congress’ national spokesperson Sanjay Jha was busy undermining India’s united stand against pro-separatists, in support of Congress leader and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder. Jha and Divya snubbed their own party Chief Minister just to bring down Prime Minister Modi, who stood up with Captain Amarinder, despite political differences. Wonder if Spandana felt the need to defend Trudeau, who is busy courting Khalistani separatists because she has fashioned  Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s social media campaign to project him as next liberal leader after Trudeau.",2018-02-19,"Captain Amarinder Singh,congress gaffes,diplomacy,divya spandana,justin trudeau,Khalistan,Narendra Modi,sanjay jha,separatists,Yogi Adityanath","While Modi takes a tough stand for Captain Amarinder, Congress wants to hug Trudeau",https://www.opindia.com/2018/02/while-modi-takes-a-tough-stand-for-captain-amarinder-congress-wants-to-hug-trudeau/

723,soulinexile,"The Indian middle class is Outraged. Outraged because Jaitley didn’t give any rebates in the Union Budget 2018 for the salaried class, the middle class. It seems to be the general opinion among many in the middle class that Modi has cheated them and fooled them. The anger is real and many sarcastic and angry meme’s and jokes about the budget being shared with gusto. They are ready to vote NOTA rather than elect a “backstabber Modi” again. Their rationale being that they won’t vote Congress, they however don’t realise that they might indirectly help Congress. Irony is – even self-declared ‘NRI intellectuals’ are complaining and shedding tears for the middle class: So what are they angry about? Appears that middle class has confused the Budget with the recurring “Discount” “Off-Season Sale”, “Bumper Sale”, “Big India Sale” banners that they have got addicted to. Amazon does a “Great Indian Sale” in January, Arun Jaitley must do a “Great Budget sale” in February. Well, the Budget is not a discount sale. The middle class should stop looking for rebates and discounts, reductions and benefits every year. Salaried class got some rebates  this year too, apart from some over last few years . It is incorrect to simply forget that, and ask for rebates every year. Just because Subramanian Swamy talks of ‘Zero Income Tax’ or media speculated about no tax up to Rs 10 lakhs, doesn’t make them automatic entitlements to get or an obligation for the government to adhere to. And while we are at it, as a bigger consumer of goods and services, middle class benefited most from the GST regime. Those struggling to make ends meet don’t care about restaurants and hotels. You pay 5% GST now, compared to a 18% Service Tax earlier on that dinner out. That rebate is entirely yours. And scores and scores of such other brackets where taxes reduced after GST. It would serve the middle class well if benefits are viewed with complete facts, rather than focusing just on tax rebates or buying Rahul Gandhi’s “Gabbar Singh Tax” idiocy. This is perhaps the biggest self-serving myth that we in middle class loves to perpetuate. Yes, the number of direct tax assessees in India is very low. That must change, and it has changed a bit. 1.8 million new tax payers added after demonetisation strike. Still only a small 2.76% Indians pay direct income tax – that is estimated to accrue 4.31 lakh crores in FY2017-18 [pdf ]. This also includes a lot of professionals/businessmen around us who earn in millions – (but since they can easily use fraud tax practices, present everything from family vacation to family dinner out as a business expense), who pay peanuts as direct taxes. Tax compliance is a different issue altogether. But, stop deluding yourself with the notion that you are the only one paying taxes. Your 4.31 lakh crores in direct taxes is just 19% of the total 22.17 lakh crore tax revenues collected by the Govt. The bulk of taxes collected come from INDIRECT Taxes collected by the govt – GST, levies, etc. – which every Indian, from the poorest of poor to the super rich pay, of course – in proportion of their consumption as per their needs and means. Firstly, go and delete those posts you shared on social media lamenting about poor farmers, because you didn’t mean them. Everyone wants poor to be helped, farmer to be saved – but it should be paid for by someone else. Well, there is no ‘someone else’ out there, it has to be ‘us’. And stop grudging the industry and corporates. There would be no middle class without industry and corporates. You would be poor class in no time, if industry died. So it already indirectly benefits YOU. India need lot more industry and corporates to help more of poor to come up into the middle class. But, wait! That is not all. Budget is all about YOU only! … and scores of such capital investments being made. Middle class has a serious Ghajini disorder! We forget the days of 10-14% inflation under UPA-2 or even when Toor daal prices being at above Rs 200/- in 2015 were a matter of middle class outrage. Where has Toor daal price been since? Did you realise the benefit of those ‘farmer friendly’ steps and meaningless E-NAM market stuff Modi’s previous budgets already accrued to YOU? If the government addresses farmers distress, YOU benefit. Lower deficit means safer future  from a resultant stable economy. If the government keeps deficit under control as Modi has –  “I am being penalised for my past investments”, “My retired fathers savings will be lost”, “Middle class is being targeted here”, and such statements were fueled by many: This lady – a senior editor in a news channel – is lying and misleading. NO! Your past gains are NOT taxed. Contrary to a lot of fluff in media – Long term gains prior to Feb 1st 2018 are completely protected and not taxed. Only future Long term Capital Gains (LTCG) will be taxed. For more clarity – read this. If you didn’t vote for socialism, I am sorry to inform you – you voted for the wrong campaign. Modi was out and out clear in his campaign. His speeches were full of references to “दरिद्र नारायण” “जन कल्याण” “माताओं बहनों की सेहत” “2022 तक हर भारतीय के सर पर छत” references. Personally – I hate socialism too. But, till the economic disparity gap is narrowed and more of poor enter middle class, you and I have to live with it. Good question! Firstly, UPA spent more on subsidy than on capital asset creation. And that huge subsidy spend was done with 60-70% leakages and bogus spends. Look at the data on ghost beneficiaries eliminated and the savings on subsidy via Aadhar and DBT in last 3 years. So, your tax money is finally being put to real use. Some people, mostly on the economic right, did object when UPA was spending more on socialist SOPS – higher on subsidy and lower on capex all through its tenure, and that too, with a whopping 70% leakage. When UPA launched NREGA that gave money for doing nothing (and kept 70% of it in the process), we didn’t hear lout outrages. We hardly outraged against FSB and RTE, (that too based on a communally discriminatory formula) where 75% must pay for free education of 25% others because Congress messed up the government education sector over past 60+ years of its rule. UPA became unpopular in the middle class because of corruption, not because of socialism. Basically, it was not socialism that shocked us, but leakages. When the right prioritised objecting to corruption more than socialism during UPA, why is the same formula not being applied here where we concentrate more on lack of corruption rather than socialism, which in most cases, is unavoidable in a country like India? There is absolutely NO party in India today which will promise to do away socialism. Not since Swatantra Party died. In fact, our constitution, amended by Indira Gandhi, now has ‘socialism’ in its preamble. Modi never ever talked of ending socialism. Go back to his election trail and recheck his speeches. If had talked so, he would have been accused of going against constitution. You outraged against the UPA corruption, leakages, scams, and Modi promised doing this with better effectiveness that it reaches the real needy by eliminating those siphoning from the system. Do you dispute that success today? No one is accusing of any leakages anymore. Ghost recipients have been eliminated and even the NREGA spends are directly going towards Capex/Infra development projects now.

724,Nithesh S,"Whenever a new car is launched in the market, the manufacturers, analysts and shareholders are usually unaware as to how the product will perform. Will people love the design? Is the comfort ok? How much is the mileage? Is the pricing right? Which models will this new car compete with? All such questions are taken into account before designing and launching a new car model. Many factors play their role in the success or failure of a new car model. Even though a model is launched with much fanfare, it may perform miserably, like Tata Nano. Other models which were launched silently may become a hit, like Maruti Swift. The right placement of a product in the market, at the right time is crucial for its success or failure. The situation of political parties is also somewhat similar. The new party in the country, Tamil Nadu to be specific, is Kamal Haasan’s ‘ Though there are some similarities between Kamal Haasan and Kejriwal, it is not right to compare him with Kejriwal. Both of them entered politics when there was a vacuum in the political space in their respective states. In the case of Kamal Haasan, the political space vacated after Jayalalitha’s demise is open for grabs. Kejriwal rode on people’s disillusionment with established parties in Delhi. However, Kamal Haasan has never been an activist like Kejriwal. He didn’t take part in any significant movement like the current Delhi CM. Kejriwal had a cadre that was associated with Lokpal movement at his disposal. They had been active social activists before taking a plunge into politics. But Kamal Haasan has to build his cadre from scratch. They may  be drawn from his fan clubs or contacts in cinema industry. Even if he does that, this cadre is not driven by a ’cause’ like Kejriwal’s AAP cadre. Secondly, Kejriwal had a fixed agenda for his newborn AAP. But Kamal Haasan is still trying to find out what his ’cause’ is. He is trying to crowdsource a cause through social media. This may or may not work for him. Usually, the electorate is able to rally behind a cause defined by a leader rather than define a cause for itself in normal times. However, we can expect Kamal to adopt a secular , left of centre ideology for his party. Thirdly, the support of Delhi based media helped Kejriwal immensely as the Delhi population is familiar with the language and is fairly urban in composition. Kamal Haasan will not be able to gain much from the hulabaloo in Delhi based media as Tamil Nadu has a significant rural electorate which does not follow Delhi centric news. Even urban population may not connect to propaganda aired from Delhi. Even though Kejriwal and Kamal shared stage during the launch of the new party, they cannot be compared with each other. The right wing’s attempt to call him a communist or a Naxal is also not going to have any effect on his electoral prospects (both positive or negative), because Naxal problem has never entered Tamil Nadu. Whether he sympathises with the ideology or not will not be a major poll issue for a majority of the electorate. Tamil Nadu is a state where issues like language, culture, anti-Brahminism and freebies are more likely to work. The last item i.e. ‘freebies’ has been a deciding factor in election results in Tamil politics. Unlike Rajnikanth, Kamal Haasan doesn’t have a ‘mad’ mass following among Tamil cinema goers. Kamal appeals to refined cinema goers and has tried to experiment with his art rather than appeal to his fan base consistently. As a result, some of his films have also flopped in the box office. If one analyses the result of 2016 assembly polls in Tamil Nadu (or for that matter any poll is last 2 decades), one will realise that Tamil Nadu is a fairly bipolar contest between DMK and AIADMK. Out 232 seats , the two parties had won 223 seats in 2016. The remaining 9 seats were won by INC (8) and IUML (1). Thus, the next Tamil Nadu assembly poll will be won by those who can fill the space left by Jayalalitha and outsmart the DMK. The performance of Kamal Haasan in politics will be defined by how he evolves or positions himself vis-a-vis existing players (DMK and AIADMK) , Rajnikanth, smaller Tamil parties , BJP and INC. Though it would unreasonable to expect Kamal to sweep polls in 2019 Lok Sabha or 2021 assembly polls, we can expect him to win some seats and if luck is on his side, he may play the role of a kingmaker. Or he may end up like Tata Nano.

725,Srikanth Ramakrishnan,"Don’t you just hate it when you pay extra for a premium service and that “premium service” doesn’t work? Mumbaikars will remember how a decade ago, the city’s transport company (Transco) – the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking – launched its purple-coloured air-conditioned Kinglong buses with much fanfare. Back in the day, A/C buses were a no-go for us middle-class high school students, but we did manage to sneak in the occasional trip. At a time when other cities getting high-end Volvo buses (manufactured in Hosakote, Karnataka) at ₹75lakh, BEST made news by saying it would spend ₹40lakh and get a bus that was made in China. However, this is where the problem began. Having moved out of Mumbai around the time these purple buses made their first appearance, my first (mis)adventure on them was two years later in 2010. I was taken aback by the huge size of the bus. … and I then asked myself the very first question: If this is a Kinglong bus, why does it not look like the Kinglong buses that I have seen on the internet and more importantly why does the logo say Cerita and not Kinglong? This was, however, only my initial reaction on seeing the bus. My main observations came while commuting. The bus I took, was headed to Andheri (Agarkar Chowk) from Mulund Check Naka. While crossing Powai, where the road is undulating and has several inclines, the airconditioning practically stopped working. Suddenly, the ₹35 ticket didn’t seem like value for money to me. A year or two later, my questions were answered when a newspaper report  surfaced. The buses were not Kinglong buses at all, but buses made by Jaycee Coaches (JCBL) under the brand of Cerita in Mohali, Punjab. Kinglong’s participation in them was a few components within the bus – a spark plug here and a spark plug there. The man behind the procurement of these buses was the then General Manager of BEST, Uttam Khobragade. Does the name ring a bell? His daughter Devyani, after all, made international headlines  for the alleged mistreatment of her domestic help. She gained  further notoriety when none other than the Supreme Court of India held that her posting as an IFS officer was made by bending rules in 1999. Now, coming back to these “Purple Faeries “, both Khobragade and then Maharashtra CM Vilasrao Deshmukh had called them Kinglong buses at the inauguration ceremony. Worse, an excuse  was made, the floral decoration during the inauguration hid the logo and thus nobody realised that it wasn’t what it was supposed to be. When asked about it several years later, Khobragade responded saying he didn’t remember the specifics because the matter was too old. The 285 buses broke down over 4,000 times in 2.5 years, caught fire  numerous times and were still in operation. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC or ST) which had around 15 of these buses in its fleet (operating on the Dadar-Pune route) quickly phased them out the minute one of them caught fire. The buses were so terrible that they perennially ran empty and were always a white elephant (or rather a purple elephant for us). They cost a lot to maintain and were heavily loss-making. On one occasion at Thane Station, when I boarded a BEST AS-700, the conductor asked me:  BEST ultimately scrapped  all AC services after playing around  with certain plans such as slashing fares, introducing short distance routes and introducing discounted fares during off-peak hours (Happy Hours), but it just didn’t work out. Today, a lot of these buses have been converted into non-AC buses and operate on short trips as Fort Pheri services after the decade-old Starbus fleet was phased out. The interesting part of all this? An IAS officer who worked with Khobragade had same very scathing views about the man. He said, “I agree that Khobragade is ‘corrupt’ and may have conspired on the King Long deal. But the question is will the Government prosecute him?” Around the same time, another scam came to light. This scam, was huge, so huge in fact that it saw the incumbent CM Ashok Chavan being shunted out and being replaced with Prithviraj Chavan. I’m sure at this point, you have understood the scam I am talking about: The Adarsh Housing scam. The scam had both Khobragade Sr and Khobragade Jr involved in it to a major extent. While the details of the scam are known to everyone – how a group of officials in the armed forces and bureaucracy bent rules, violating FSI, zoning laws, coastal guidelines, and more to build the apartment complex and then allotted houses to themselves – there is one interesting thing that stands out. The Adarsh building stands right next to BEST’s Backbay Depot in Cuffe Parade and according to several reports, the land was meant to be for expanding the depot. Now, given that Khobragade Sr was in charge at the time, it would have been quite impossible for the matter to proceed without his involvement. But how deep was his involvement? Pretty deep, according  to this Firstpost report, that says that thanks to the shady land swap, the Adarsh building went up from six floors to 31 floors! You read that right. The building was originally meant to be six floors, but due to some land being usurped from BEST, it had the required FSI to go up to 31 floors! After this, Khobragade Jr got herself a flat in the building, along with another flat allotted in a government colony in Oshiwara where she paid a minor sum to get it. During a trip on an AS-4 to Backbay Depot in 2015, I had a conversation with the driver and conductor. While they both were criticising the rattling bus, the conductor pointed to the monstrosity in front of the depot and asked me if I knew what it was. Before I could reply, he said (without batting an eyelid) –  But why is all this relevant? Around ten days ago, news  came out that Uttam Khobragade had joined the Congress. Yes, the same Congress that did nothing for highways till 2004 and then had the nerve to tell voters that they did more in 10 years of UPA than what the NDA did in five years under Vajpayee. The same Congress under whose watchful gaze (1999 to 2014), Mumbai fell victim to no less than 7 terror attacks killing over 450 people. The same Congress that pulled off astronomical scams and yet comes to us begging for votes. The same Congress whose functionaries go to Pakistan and say “get rid of them and bring us back”. Transport is a very personal issue for a lot of us and any official who messes it up needs to be reminded that they are hurting the common man.

726,OpIndia Staff,"Subramanian Swamy’s “nuclear bomb ” in the National Herald case is still causing havoc. A detailed study of the 105 page Income Tax Order received by Young Indian documents throws up some very serious irregularities. We have already seen how Young Indian, via its promoters (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) tried their best to thwart  the investigation proceedings. Now, some more perusing reveals that the Congress party too tried its very best. The crux of the case lies in the fact that the Indian National Congress/All India Congress Committee (AICC) had over the years advanced a loan of 90 crore rupees to Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which published its mouthpiece, the National Herald. These loans were later sold cheap for just 50 lakhs rupees and were used to give a 99% stake in AJL to the Gandhis, via the company Young Indian (YI), thus transferring the ownership of valuable assets owned by AJL to YI. The Income Tax department decided to verify the nature and genuineness of these loans. For this, they had to write to the parties involved in the transaction, which included the AICC. The order quotes replies from AICC, which show AICC too, like the Gandhis, was not very cooperative in the investigation. In response to a summons dated 04.05.2017, the AICC sent a letter to the tax department dated 15.06.2017. A portion of the same, which was quoted in the tax department’s order, is mentioned below: The paragraph shows how AICC tried to divert the questions by asking the ‘relevance’ of the questions to the case. While this in itself may not be a major problem, the next reply quoted in the order speaks volumes. In a reply dated 24.08.2017, the AICC wrote to the tax officer (relevant portions reproduced): In this reply, the AICC went into complete attack mode. They first alleged that the tax officer was being misused in a “politically motivated” contest. The next paragraph though was even more revealing: Here the AICC has directly threatened legal action against the tax officer because they believed that he was seeking information which was not relevant to the case. Let us step back here, this is the oldest political party in India, which has held office for the most number of years, threatening legal action against an Income Tax officer, who is investigating a matter involving a company owned by the Gandhis, not the Congress. And all this is being done in writing! The Gandhis can very well be expected to say these things since their own company was in the dock. But the AICC was being questioned only to gain information to verify the transactions of YI. Yet AICC stepped in to defend the Gandhis and used its muscle and clout to influence the officer by threatening him with legal action. Non-cooperative attitude while replying, or questioning the motives of an officer can to an extent be accepted, but this was a direct threat given in writing. Did AICC try any other extra-constitutional means off the record?",2018-01-21,"aicc,Congress,Congress scams,income tax officer,national herald,National Herald IT papers,rahul gandhi,sonia gandhi,threaten,young indian",National Herald case: Congress threatened tax officers with legal consequences for asking ‘irrelevant’ questions,https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/national-herald-case-congress-threatened-tax-officers-with-legal-consequences-for-asking-irrelevant-questions/

Soon enough support poured in from Pakistan and #IStandWithAjazKhan was also trending on Twitter (as per Ajaz’s claim on his Twitter page). It is also noteworthy how Ajaz gleefully retweeted the tweets from Pakistan supporting his stand of choosing the Quran over the Constitution, thereby undermining the sovereignty of India for religion: Aam Aadmi Party’s Ved Prakash, also came out in support of Ajaz: Congress’ recent ally Hardik Patel too supported him: Interestingly, Jignesh Mevani, an aide of Hardik Patel, had recently asked  BJP leaders to choose between Manu Smriti or Constitution, but appears that the new ‘youth leaders’ have no problem supporting someone who openly says he chooses Quran over constitution.

Swamy said that perhaps Congress is not addressing the media on National Herald because if they do, they will have to confirm whether those papers presented by Swamy are authentic or not, and whether they were served with these documents by the IT authorities.

729,Sambit Nayak,"The evident eventuality has happened in Odisha politics. Jay Panda has been suspended from BJD’s primary membership as announced in a press meet by party spokesperson and vice president Surya Narayan Patro, late in the evening on 24th January. It was only couple of weeks back that party supremo and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik hinted at disciplinary action.  Hence this suspension comes as little or no surprise. In its press release, BJD has put forward its reasoning on the suspension: It’s interesting to note that the press release starts with naming Panda as Vice Chairman of IMFA (Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys). The party then alleges that Panda was involved in anti-party activities. Panda has been quite vocal in appreciating some of the policy decision of centre and clearly party leadership has not taken it lightly. BJD also contends that during the panchayat elections  where BJD got a drubbing, Panda didn’t campaign for party candidates, he in fact supported opposition candidates. What is rather amusing to note is, BJD cites a very unusual reason for the alleged anti-party activities of Panda. Panda seems to have requested the party to make him a member of Standing Committee of Finance in Parliament and he claimed to have enough clout to lobby for becoming the Chairman. As he himself is an industrialist, BJD saw this as a conflict of interest and denied this request. As per BJD’s official press release, this is the reason which started his periodic rumblings of discontent. However, his official position in IMFA, his annual remuneration in IMFA & IMFA’s loan waiver etc. seem unnecessary and disconnected with his suspension. Hence the mention of these smacks of a personal vendetta rather than a valid motive. The suspension follows closely allegations against Panda that he did not ‘consult’ party members before deciding to spend funds allocated for his parliamentary constituency. Panda had rubbished  these allegations but the party decided to ‘investigate’. BJD had engaged its Kendrapara district observer Smt Pramila Mallick, incidentally an accused in Dal Scam  during BJD’s rule in 2011, and Cuttack district observer Smt Usha Devi to probe the allegations brought against Panda by various party cadres. Pramila Mallick had a phone conversation where Panda refuted the allegations. It is not clear if Usha Devi met Panda or not but submitted her report on 23rd Jan. BJD has not made any of these reports public though the set of events hint at an adverse report. Suspending founding and senior members is not new to BJD and in fact is a routine affair. It is believed that Naveen Patnaik doesn’t like senior members to grow in stature and has learned the art of cutting them to size in time, lest they outgrow him. Senior members who were very close to Biju Patnaik and helped Naveen Patnaik to bring BJD into being have all been suspended from BJD, Panda probably being the last one. Dilip Ray , Bijaya Mahapatra  and Late Nalini Mohanty  were expelled from BJD long back. While Late Shri Nalini Mohanty had joined Congress, Dilip Ray and Bijaya Mahapatra are currently in BJP with Ray being the incumbent MLA of Rourkela on a BJP ticket. Very recently, another founding member Dr. Damodar Rout was first suspended  from cabinet and from party’s Vice President position later on. It will be worthwhile to note that, even Dr. Rout referring to the personal secretary to Naveen Patnaik had quipped that, “3rd floor (CMO in Odisha secretariat) is definitely putting pressure on party members”. He went onto say that there should not be a second power center within the party. Last year, Panda, without naming IAS officer Pandian, had hinted on multiple occasion that the said officer had assumed unfathomable clout within party politics crossing his “Lakshman rekha “. IAS officers running the state is not a new phenomenon either. During his tenure, chief secretary Bijay Patnaik wielded immense authority. Former chief secretary and close aide of Naveen Patnaik Late Shri Pyari Mohan Mohapatra was expelled from party following his attempted coup  when Naveen was in London. Pyari was so powerful during his tenure in the party that, his residence was nicknamed  Sahid Nagar Power Centre as every file had to pass through his residence at Sahid Nagar, an upscale locality in Bhubaneswar. The industrialists had to make a beeline at his residence to get their projects approved. Essentially, this suspension could be a result of either babu-politician nexus in state politics or insecurity of Naveen Patnaik. Panda has expressed his shock and dejection at the suspension and has denied all charges against him as false and baseless. The suspension has generated widespread reaction in Odisha political quarters. While BJP leaders are heaving praises on Panda, Congress leader Ganeswar Behera who also hails from Kendrapara and has seen Panda’s work from close quarter, terms this unfortunate and a loss to BJD. BJP senior leader Biswabhusan Harichandan has described the suspension as “Cheap Mentality” of BJD. He has, on record, submitted that BJP will surely consider Panda’s induction, if Panda shows interest. Post this suspension, Odisha politics in general and Kendrapara politics in particular is going to be very interesting. It is almost a no brainer that Panda will not jump ships right now. Anti-defection law mandates a by-election if a sitting MP or MLA resigns from party (he has been suspended, not expelled thus he can’t join another party yet) and neither BJD nor BJP want an election right now. What remains to be seen is, whom will BJD chose to take on Panda, if he decides to contest from BJP party ticket from Kendrapara in 2019. Former party senior member Bijaya Mahapatra, who had defected to BJP, has been expelled from BJP’s district committee and has dropped enough hints that he may rejoin BJD. He is a senior and popular leader in Kendrapara area. The other name that comes to fore is Atanu Sabyasachi, but his clout is limited to Mahanga and Mahakalapada area. Another senior party leader from BJD, Pratap Singh Deb, who also hails from a royal family in Kendrapara, has already been nominated as Rajya Sabha member. Though Panda enjoys popular support in Kendrapara, his volunteer base is no match to BJD’s. The contest is surely going to hot up the political climate in Kendrapara. Another equation that can’t be discounted is, in Panda BJP may have finally found a credible face for its CM candidate to counter the TINA factor which is believed to have given Naveen an edge in Odisha electoral politics. Where does it leave Dharmendra Pradhan then? Though BJP is not known to give top posts to new joiners, this will be an interesting situation where BJP needs a face. Well these are all speculation right now but definitely something to look forward to as things evolve. One only hopes that the people of Kendrapara and Odisha get a good deal from this competitive politics and their aspirations are fulfilled.",2018-01-25,"Analysis,Baijayant Jay Panda,BJD,BJP,Corruption,Elections,Jay Panda,Naveen Patnaik,Odisha","Baijayant Panda suspended from BJD, what lies ahead for him",https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/baijayant-panda-suspended-from-bjd-what-lies-ahead-for-him/
730,Shantanu,"In the last 2-3 days, you might have come across some comments, especially on the social media, that the World Bank could review its latest Ease of Doing Business ranking, and India will be given a lower rank than the 100 As soon as a global endorsement of India doing better on some parameters came, some people in India were deeply hurt and attempts to discredit the rankings began. OpIndia.com had carried a piece  that showed how shallow and silly some of these attempts to discredit the rankings were. But perhaps the silliest of those attempts were the claims made by some Congress leaders, which were obliquely supported by their leader Rahul Gandhi, that the rankings were “fixed ”. Basically, the Congress party insinuated that the Modi government had paid money to World Bank to manipulate data to show India in a better light. Since such claims by the Congress party appear silly on the face value, the Congress fed ‘ecosystem’ was under pressure to come up with some ‘intellectual’ sounding reasons to back this conspiracy theory. And the ecosystem got an opportunity earlier this month. On 12 January this year, a controversy erupted around the (Ease of) Doing Business rankings when WSJ (Wall Street Journal) published a story claiming that World Bank’s chief economist Paul Romer had said that they (World Bank) had changed the methodology of calculating the rankings in ways that were misleading and unfair, suggesting political motivation behind doing so. The controversy had surrounded one particular country – Chile. However, 4 days later, Paul Romer clarified in his personal blog  that he had neither seen any manipulation of rankings nor did he think that he had said so in the interview. But on 20 January, “Go News”, a news website run by Pankaj Pachauri – former NDTV anchor and Communications Advisor to Manmohan Singh’s PMO – published an article  titled “India’s ease of doing business just got uneasy”. The article referred to Romer’s alleged comments about political manipulation despite Romer having clarified otherwise, and worse, it dragged in India while the original controversy was about Chile. In the said article, Go News resorted to lies and spins to insinuate that India’s improvement in Doing Business rankings was on account of dubious methodology and political manipulation. The website claimed that there will be a review of Doing Business rankings and India will be given a lower rank, in the process giving credence to earlier claims by the Congress party that the rankings were “fixed”. But the truth is that World Bank has made it clear that the said review will be limited only to Chile . There will be no review of any other country’s performance. Interestingly, Go News contradicts itself later in the same article admitting that the review will be restricted to Chile (emphasis added) – Go News didn’t stop here. It gave the entire matter further twist by trying to discredit the Doing Business rankings based on the views of a think-tank called Centre for Global Development (CGD). This think-tank has calculated its own rankings based on World Bank’s data and ranked India 147handles  in 2018 using their own methodology, which Go News tried to present, through their social media  This was further spread  on the social media by some anti-Modi commentators such as a journalist named Mihir Sharma , who earlier worked with a newspaper called Business Standard (BS). A couple of days later, BS also published an article  based CGD’s rankings and questioned World Bank’s credibility. With this being a carefully crafted and well-orchestrated narrative, I feel it’s important to highlight the following points with respect to World Bank and CGD rankings – So in essence, a misconstrued comment by a World Bank economist about Chile’s rankings were used to insinuate that Indian ranking was manipulated. To further promote this insinuation, findings by a ‘think tank’ – which also makes no comments about any manipulation to favor India – were used out of context. This was done not only by a news website run by Manmohan Singh’s former aide, but by various economists, activists, psephologists and other -ists to attack the Modi government. It shows either their desperation or lack of basic comprehension.

731,nandini,"Many like myself were disgusted with the Congress and ashamed to have a Prime Minister like Manmohan Singh, who had demeaned his office to such an extent that he was a parody of himself. There was not one cabinet minister who wasn’t arrogant and infuriating. A constant musical chairs of incompetent but loyal to Sonia Gandhi men and women shunted from one ministry to the other in cabinet reshuffles. Sometimes it felt she took perverse pleasure in pushing in our face, party members, allies and even a President who were known to be obnoxiously corrupt or compromised. To make matters worse, her dutiful puppet every once in a while, declared that he was only keeping his seat warm for the untested and by all accounts, irresponsible and intellectually deficient, Rahul Gandhi. On the other hand, the alternate choice before us was a lack lustre BJP. LK Advani wasn’t in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee mould but neither had he anything new to offer for himself. Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley’s oratory was par excellence and when compared to the jarring Sonia Gandhi along with the monosyllabic Manmohan Singh, it was indeed music to the ears. However, it did not escape many of us that despite the din in the Parliament and all the walkouts almost every UPA bill was passed. So, what exactly did the BJP stand for? Was it in reality only the ‘Indian National Congress with a cow’ with the Ram Mandir vaguely looming in the background? In this very disheartening, lack lustre and almost hopeless scenario, Narendra Modi was declared BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate and as a consequence we witnessed a definite electrifying effect on the political scene. For many of us it was as if a defibrillator had been applied. The jolt woke us up from a helpless, depressing slumber. From the howls of rage heard across the media and the establishment. It was a terrifying moment indeed for others. A Narendra Modi victory could well mean years of privilege, access to high echelons and the gravy train coming to a stop. The election itself was hard, gritty and nasty. But suddenly there was so much hope. A hope that could be clutched, touched and held despite a panicky mainstream media that was attempting to put out, what was nothing less than a forest fire by stomping all over it. A successful Chief Minister, a self-made man, with no dynasty behind him or before, brought a newness never experienced. But in our hearts, we did have a moment of worry for this man was new to the clawing, ruthless network of Delhi that had for centuries, chewed and spat out lesser men and women. We watched with some doubt and trepidation, the chosen Lutyens’s acolyte who was given the task of manoeuvring the power corridors for him. But what the hell. If it was required, so be it. We looked forward to governance, accountability and a surge of infrastructural, educational and healthcare projects that would improve the quality of life of our neglected masses. We hoped for a foreign policy, the hallmark of which, would be unapologetically pro Indian and would focus on the revival of the economy. Of course, that appeasement which made us feel that we were of a lesser God would be done away with and Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas would be the path that this government would tread. The one hope that perhaps everyone harboured in their hearts, was that the looters and thieves of the last regime would pay dearly for their misdeeds. It must be said that there have been several successes and moments of great pride for a desperately parched Nation, but, there have been a few missteps too and there is no doubt so much more must be done. However, integrity and intent are there to see, which was so painfully lacking in the previous regime. This must be appreciated and applauded. We remember this time, five years ago, all that we could discuss was scams, scams and more scams. There has been a deep disappointment that old crooks and power brokers still abound fearless in their invincibility. Still, it has been an education in itself to see the serpents of the old ecosystem bare their fangs and coil themselves protectively around one of theirs. An indication of the dangers that lie in poking the nest. Nevertheless, it will have to be eventually done but on the day of one’s choice and preparedness. Then there are many others who expected much more from a BJP government. Not only an end to the insulting appeasement but a rectifying of decades and might one say, even centuries of injustice. In places of worship, education, history, tradition, culture so criminally neglected by past establishments and their entrenched eco-systems for reasons that can be discussed till the cows come home. It’s accepted that the job of any elected government is to provide temporal relief, to win elections, make inroads into new vote banks and to stay in power so as to continue the policies and work it set out to do in the first place. Citizens, pressure groups must demand and leverage the rest. For a government to comply, a movement must be seen. The first step was taken with the consolidation of the Hindu vote. Civilizational changes don’t take place while we are away at work or whatever we do. It’s something that people make happen. In the first month of 2018, a year away from the next general elections, give or take, many BJP supporters are voicing disappointment. They feel let down and are not motivated enough to go out and vote for the BJP again. They will go NOTA they say. Not voting for the BJP but not voting for the Congress either. But Gujarat has made us aware of the pitfalls of such voting patterns and how it helps the Opposition claim a hollow but ‘moral victory’. And hence, here is where I ask them to re consider. Our history is such that there were many among our forefathers who invited what they thought was a lesser enemy to fight a bigger one. Then, they learnt to their peril and realised that it was not a smart idea at all. There were many others who promised their band of soldiers but then didn’t turn up for battle, or worse, opened the gates for a few pieces of silver, a Jagir or a place at Court. For those mistakes, we have paid very dearly. However, we mustn’t forget that they were also those who fought battle after battle against what seemed an invincible, cruel, unscrupulous enemy. Ignoring danger to life and limb they went back to fight another day. Imagine the determination. That courage to fight day after day, year after year, decade after decade for generations to come. If we are still here, it’s only because of them. It would be such injustice to our future generations if we give up after a mere five years. When after seventy long years we have both – opportunity, and a leader of calibre. This journey is for the long haul and not for the faint hearted. There are millions of educated Indians who only read mainstream newspapers, watch the standard dozen panelists on TV and forward WhatsApp messages. They are completely unaware of the discriminatory nature of RTE, have no knowledge that their temples, unlike mosques and churches, are under the control of the government or how we barely escaped, by the skin of our teeth, the devious Communal Bill. But yes, they have noticed that the festivals and traditions that are held dear, have over the years been subliminally and cleverly nibbled away. It must be noted that they are primed for discussion and debate. So, wake up every morning, strap yourself with the weapon of your choice and then, fight the battle in your own small way. Inform, educate, spread the word. Didn’t anybody tell you civilizational wars are not won in a day? Forget about hearing you, the other lot don’t even see you. So, demand, extract and most importantly – make a dent, do your bit. But don’t, don’t let this opportunity go. The future will not be forgiving. The reason most people fail instead of succeed, is they trade what they want most for what they want at the moment.",2018-01-28,"BJP,Congress,Hindus,Hindustan,modi government,Narendra Modi,Right Wing","Rome was not built in a day, it was built everyday – unite, fight, make a difference",https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/rome-was-not-built-in-a-day-it-was-built-everyday-unite-fight-make-a-difference/

The city had a quartet of such famous joints, actually.  Last one was my favourite. As a kid, I used to fall ill once every two months and my recovery celebration was always a plate of chhole samose from Chand’s joint. Badri, however, was the most famous among them. His shop, situated in the main market of the city was always crowded. Customers had around a dozen varieties to choose from and Badri would always serve them fresh and steaming hot, it only meant that 45 minutes to one hour waiting time was normal. Still people loved the crispy but succulent  The recipe or the methodology Badri used was the talking point in most drawing rooms (or Baithaks as they were called back then) and at card games sessions at the roadside, rumours were rife about some secret ingredients he added, some even claimed to know that Badri had not even revealed the secret ingredient or methodology to his family for the fear of it leaking out, many believed that he had accumulated immense amount of wealth and buried it underneath his house. And the closed environment of our small town, coupled with limited awareness of the rest of the world and the immaturity of our ages, we kids believed that no other town had the pride of having such greats. So much so that in those days, if anyone asked kids of our age about what we aspired to be in our lives, some of us, other than those who were not worried about the uncertainties of world outside and were willing to sacrifice the comforts of hometown for regular jobs, would have expressed a wish to become a Badri or a Chand or someone like them. And now, Rahul Gandhi’s party Congress, mocks the  Was Badri, who was a respectable member of our town, who was believed to be having a secret recipe, believed to have immeasurable wealth including a buried treasure and subject of jealousy for many others, a beggar? Hundreds of others who dot the lanes of small town of Hansi, lakhs of such hard working aspirational people of India, are they beggars? Bhaggi, who sells eggs on his handcart is a respectable member of his community, part of the decision making body of his caste  Such insulting, contemptuous view of hardworking people reflects not only an elitist mentality that considers working people as inferior but also but also exposes their woefully limited knowledge about what moves the economy in the small and medium towns and villages in India. It represents a myopic world view where only three classes of people are worthy of being acknowledged or respected, the classes that fulfill their needs; Mallyas and Vadras who provide cash chests, NREGA level poor who would vote to return them to power and thirdly, those who create a narrative of the greatness of the halfwit dynast i.e. media. Everyone else can be wished away disdainfully. This is also the view of a rent seeker, of a dynast, who cannot understand why some people want to earn a living using their own intelligence, skill, talent and hardwork, and not using a family name. Why some people are motivated by their aspirations of a better tomorrow and want a better future. Why they do not wish to remain freeloaders, waiting for a mai baap government to give a dole, a job, a grant. This world view hates aspiration, the self esteem that new India wants to live by, because every hardworking person makes the freeloader dynast look smaller, in his own eyes. However, unconcerned by what Rahul’s pals like Chidambaram think about them or call them, Bhaggi, Titu, Ramesh, Jaidu go on with their life, working from morning to evening, fulfilling their aspirations bit by bit, creating a better tomorrow, for themselves and their families, powering the economy of their small town, while Badri, the ‘Pakodewala of Hansi’ is smiling on them from his heavenly abode.

733,OpIndia Staff,"Ahead of the crucial Karnataka elections, the Congress might be facing an exodus of sorts, with its Muslim members becoming disillusioned  with the party. As per these Muslim members, the party has become crowded for them to climb the ranks. As per the report, what is making things worse for them is alleged nepotism by veteran leaders. This drive to promote one’s own children seems to be resulting in the minority quota getting filled, before the common members get a chance. The nepotism in the minority section of the party is so deep-set that former Kalaburagi Youth Congress president Nasir Hussain Ustad decided to quit the party, because he felt he would be denied a ticket for accommodating the wife of former Minister Qamural Islam. This lack of opportunity has resulted in youth Congress members like Syed Arshadulla quitting the party after a service of over two decades, by alleging that the party offers no hope of recognition. External factors like a possible inclusion  of dissident JD(S) MLA B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan has further disillusioned these Muslim members, who feel that the opportunities might become even more far and few. Such news about this Muslim abandonment comes in the backdrop of allegations of minority appeasement against the Siddaramaiah government. We had reported  how the BJP had alleged that Siddaramiah has asked for the opinion of district police heads in the state regarding withdrawal of cases lodged against minorities in communal incidents. The letter signed by AIGP (General) of Karnataka, addressed to 23 district police heads (including communally sensitive Mangaluru) asked for their clear opinion regarding withdrawal of cases lodged against minorities for the past five years. Following a backlash, the Siddaramaiah government proceeded to ‘correct’  the letter in question by asking the police to review cases against all innocent people involved in various cases (including communal incidents) in the state. The government used the defence of a ‘clerical error’, to address the issue of specific reference to minorities in the earlier letter. But such ‘corrections’ don’t totally vindicate the Siddaramaiah government as it has also been accused of dropping 175 cases against extremist Islamic organisation Popular Front of India (PFI) in 2015. It remains to be seen how Congress President reacts to this Muslims abandoning his party, and what steps he decides to take in this regard, considering he has been striving hard to create a soft Hindutva for himself in the recent assembly elections.",2018-01-30,"Congress,disillusionment,karnataka,Muslims,Nepotism,Politics,rahul gandhi,Siddaramaiah",Congress faces nepotism charges as Muslim members in Karnataka leave the party en masse,https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/congress-faces-nepotism-charges-as-muslim-members-in-karnataka-leave-the-party-en-masse/
734,K Bhattacharjee,"In the by-polls held in Rajasthan on the 29th of January, Congress has won  the Mandalgarh Assembly seat and the Alwar Lok Sabha seat and has significant lead in Ajmer. The BJP had won comfortably in these Lok Sabha seats with margins of 2,83,985 and 1,71,983 votes respectively. Today’s defeat of the BJP reflect a shift of over 4 lakh votes in the two combined Lok Sabha seats. The results will come as a huge jolt to the BJP ahead of the Assembly elections later this year. There have been reports of severe discontentment of the voters with the Vasundhara Raje government in recent times. These results will serve as a much needed wake up call to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The President of the Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi, took to Twitter to congratulate the state unit of the party in Rajasthan. We had reported  earlier that amidst the recent Padmavat controversy, several Rajput organizations swore their unconditional support to the Congress ahead of the by-polls and vowed to avenge the ‘insult’ that the BJP government had meted out to the Rajput community. The results indicate that they have indeed been successful in their attempt to convey their message of resentment and anger towards the BJP. The Congress have cleverly  taken advantage of the whole controversy surrounding the movie and successfully turned it to their advantage. Ashok Gehlot of the Congress remarked they were only taking forward the positive result they achieved in Gujarat. Complaints about EVM tampering on result day, which have become a tradition in recent times, also seem to have evaporated into thin air as order seems to have been restored with a Congress victory. In other news, Trinamool in West Bengal has won the Noapara Assembly seat and Uluberia Lok Sabha seat that went into the by-polls.

735,OpIndia Staff,"Subramanian Swamy on Saturday revealed his big game plan on how he plans to tighten the noose on the National Herald case. He said he is looking at interpreting the law such that one ‘TDK’ who is accused in the National Herald case becomes witness for the prosecution. TDK here is believed to be short for Tadakka, which Swamy himself had clarified to his followers back in 2012. According to Hindu mythology, Tadakka (or Tataka) was a Yaksha princess-turned-demoness in the Hindu epic Ramayana, who was cursed by sage Agastya for being vengeful on him following her husband’s death. She and her son Sabahu turned demonic, attempting to harass as many rishis as they could by destroying their Yagna, the holy fire. Swamy has a penchant to give code names to his enemies and uses these code names to refer to them in his tweets. People sometimes try and guess them, and if they get them wrong, Swamy even corrects them. Coming back to the National Herald case, yesterday, he had talked about walking out of the house for getting his newspapers and finding ‘explosive’ documents in an unmarked envelop. We had reported  how the National Herald case has been a thorn for the Gandhi family for years. After paying just Rs. 5 lakh to form a company called ‘Young India’, the Mother and Son duo allegedly managed to acquire assets of the National Herald worth Rs. 5000 crores. Additionally they allegedly earned rent to the tune of Rs. 60 lakh per month after renting out the press area property. Essentially, Subramanian Swamy has accused Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, among others, of cheating and misappropriation of funds. Last year in May, the Gandhis were dealt a huge blow  when the Delhi High Court dismissed a plea to stay proceedings against Young India in the National Herald case and cleared the path for an Income Tax Probe into Young India Private Ltd. for its involvement in the case. The Mainstream Media seems overeager to give the Gandhis a free pass  in the matter but unfortunately for them, the matter will be resolved in the Court of Law and not the newsrooms of news channels.",2018-01-20,"Corruption,national herald,rahul gandhi,Shashi Tharoor,sonia gandhi,subramanian swamy",Subramanian Swamy reveals his game plan for National Herald case,https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/subramanian-swamy-reveals-his-game-plan-for-national-herald-case/
736,OpIndia Staff,"Despite Delhi Police’s refusal to grant permission to hold the ‘Yuva Hunkar Rally’ in Delhi, Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, who has been accused  of instigating riots, freelance protestor Shehla Rashid and others have defied police orders to conduct the rally. Despite Delhi Police’s explicit refusal to grant permission to hold the rally, the Shehla Rashid and gang are blatantly lying on social media of having granted the permission. The ‘social justice’ rally is allegedly being held to demand  release of Dalit outfit Bhim Army, Chandrashekhar Azad, who was arrested last year in June for being the main accused in Thakur-Dalit clash in Himachal Pradesh. The Delhi Police, however, has clearly denied permission for the rally to be held. The Police says that they have offered an alternate venue for the rally, but the organisers were reluctant to go there, reasons of which are not known. Despite the clear statement by Delhi Police, Shehla Rashid, arrogantly said that the rally will be conducted at Parliament Street only. She had once claimed that since she is a Muslim, she doesn’t lie even though she has a history  of lying and today, she has been caught lying yet again. What stands out is, how confused the entire gang looks, swinging between “we have permission” and “it’s wrong to not give us permission”. Earlier, Prashant Bhushan had quoted a tweet by Shehla that said that they had met the Delhi Police twice and they had got clear permission to go ahead with the rally, and that the media was running “fake news” by saying that no permission was granted for the “Yuva Rally”. Funnily enough, today after Delhi Police clarified that Shehla and gang were perhaps lying and no permission was granted to them for the rally, Prashant himself changed goalposts and said that “it would be undemocratic” of the police to stop the gang from protesting which is their “fundamental right”. One wonders, if indeed the Delhi Police had granted permission, why has Shehla, Bhushan or anyone of their comrades not produced any evidence to back their claim. In fact, as if in sync, they have all changed their line of argument to the usual “this is my right, police can’t stop us”, instead of saying “Delhi police is backtracking after giving permission”, which further raises the suspicion if any permission was granted in the first place. The central issue here seems to be not only the blatant defiance of police orders, but also the lies that surrounded this rally. These career protesters have not been able to prove that the Delhi police granted permission, and now, the usual cacophony of “state is trampling our fundamental rights” has gathered momentum to distract people from the fact that the demonstration seems to be going ahead without police permission. Shehla however, is not new to such shenanigans. Earlier Shehla had no proof for a tweet she claimed was tweeted to her during demonetisation. She has also lied and accused JNU administration of restricting student access to ‘filtered’ content from YouTube. Through this entire fiasco, none of them are claiming that the Delhi Police has backed off from granting the permission. Once their lies were caught, the gang started claiming that police can’t deny permission. While it is interesting to note how these elements have indicted themselves in the tangled web of lies, it is also worrying how police orders are being defied blatantly with scant regard for law and order.",2018-01-09,"Bhima Koregaon,Delhi,Delhi Police,jignesh mevani,JNU,rally,shehla rashid,Umar Khalid",Delhi police exposes lies of leftists over Mevani rally in Delhi,https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/delhi-police-exposes-lies-of-leftists-over-mevani-rally-in-delhi/
737,rohitagarwal,"It was 15th May 2014, and despondency hung heavy at Akbar Road and Janpath alike. Despite all the bluster and bravado of the past few months, the inevitability of what tomorrow would bring was sinking in. Of course, the magnitude of the disaster was something they were yet oblivious to, mercifully for them. A gloomy faced general secretary was busy tending to the bonfire in the backyard, and two menials assisted him in adding files to the flames as they were brought in. A couple of convenient fire accidents, in key offices in Lutyens past few weeks ,had ensured a lighter load for them, but it was still enough for them to toil for hours on that hot May afternoon. Inside, the Moon Face Mantri (MFM) and Chachaji were deep in discussion. They had the unenviable task of facing Mamma with the news. The coterie had, as usual, fed her what she wanted to hear – that the election was in the bag, and they would probably get a larger majority than last time. She had enquired, a couple of times, about the wave that everyone seemed to be taking about, but they had assured her that there was no such thing. But now finally the truth had to be told. Bhaijan met them outside the house, his grim face reflecting their own mood, and led them to her presence. The usually blank face bore a deep frown, which deepened on seeing the trio. She sat cross armed and stared at them as they stood like unruly schoolboys in the Principal’s office. Without asking them to sit, she raised an eyebrow at Bhaijan, indicating that he could start speaking. Being the most trusted aide, he was the only one who dared to break the bad news, and now he did in detail. The stony face slowly turned red as the aide spoke of a future that appeared dimmer and dimmer. After he had finished speaking, there was a long, painful silence as Mamma looked from one face to the other. Then MFM spoke up hesitatingly, “But don’t worry ma’am. It’s a matter of five years, if not less. And we have our contingency plans in place.” Her stare was surpassed only by her tone in iciness, as she asked, “What contingency plan?” Bhaijan was called away by an urgent call, leaving the two to explain. “We are leaving enough ’Deep Assets’ to ensure that they don’t have a smooth tenure. In fact, I would be surprised if they are able to get anything done at all. And if that doesn’t result in a mid-term election, it certainly won’t allow them to be re-elected after five years are over. Don’t you remember 2004?” Chachaji was at his smoothest, and was rewarded by a slight nod. “Deep Assets?” She asked. “What Deep Assets?” Chachaji gave a semi-toothless grin and said, “We have a robust ecosystem in place. We have been very generous in sharing our .. ahem… ‘profits’ and in patronising the right kind of people over the years. Media, Bureaucracy, Intelligentsia … you name it, they’ve been our beneficiaries. It’s these people who will help us out in our times of difficulty.” “Besides,” butted in MFM not wanting Chachaji to shine alone, “there are enough policy “Time Bombs” that will keep them on their toes for a while. The Pay Commission itself will ensure that no one is satisfied, and give recommendations that will show the government in very bad light. There are reservation promises we have made to this group and that. Then there’s the subsidy bill from our populist schemes.” Seeing the slight thaw in her icy demeanour, Chachaji felt encouraged to elaborate further. “For years we have built up a narrative about our secularism vis a vis the ‘communalism’ of the saffron brigade. Now’s the time for us to say “we told you so!” India is a violent country. Every day there are dozens of murders, lynchings, arson, rapes, suicides… Been going on for ever, and bound to continue. But now, we will make people believe that each such crime is due to the hate that the ruling dispensation has – for minorities, for Dalits – whoever the victim may be. We will ensure media outrage, candle-lit marches, dharnas…” “Hmmm…” she stared at the wall pensively. “But are you sure that the people will fall for that?” “Oh! Our biggest weapon is doubt. Said MFM. Put doubts in people’s minds, and once the narrative is repeated often enough through different sources, even the staunchest of their supporters will start having some doubts. And it’s not as if we have to prove anything in any court – just make them look bad again and again, at every opportunity, till people actually start believing it.” “We will create doubts about every step they take. Added Chachaji. Every action, every policy, every scheme. We’ll blindly call everything a failure. We’ll create doubts about every institution – the RBI, Election Commission, the Judiciary, the banking system. We have most of the media and a lot of credible voices under our obligations – economists, professors, analysts, NGOs, activists. They’ll all sing our tune.” “But won’t they have an advantage once they’re in power? Why should the ecosystem continue to support us?” She asked. MFM and Chachaji looked at each other, amazed that someone who had been at the helm of affairs for so long could be so out of touch with reality. “No no Ma’am.” MFM blurted. “You see, these fools want to actually provide a ‘clean’ government. That would deprive the entire ecosystem of the lucre they have become so used to. And if they actually want things to get done, the babus will have to work. They won’t like that either. They will do anything to restore status quo ante of no work and all money – nudged along by us of course. As we know so well, it’s the bureaucracy that is responsible for execution, and no matter how good any policy is, if we sabotage the execution, it will all end up in naught.” “And the corruption cases? Won’t they go on a witch hunt after all of us? What if we land up in jail?” She asked worriedly. Chachaji smiled and said, “Oh they will try. But the ecosystem is widespread, and includes the entire law and order system. The investigative agencies will file half-hearted cases, and the judges won’t be able to rule against us even if they want to. Besides, we have covered our tracks pretty well. So the cases will get dismissed one by one, and then we can cry political vendetta. That would help us tremendously in the next elections.” “And then of course, we won’t let parliament function at all. We will keep disrupting it on some pretext or the other, so that they can’t make any worthwhile legislation.” MFM chimed in. “And we will keep crying about the economy. Again, it’s the perception which matters. We can always find something to cry about even if it’s doing reasonably well, and sow doubts in people’s minds.” “And you think all this will ensure our return in 2019?” She asked. “Of course.” Chachaji replied confidently. “All this, combined with our trump card – divide and rule. Religion. Caste. Region. We will pit lower castes against upper, Muslims against Hindus, States against the centre. Our job is to ensure that the government is busy dealing with crises, clashes and agitations. So busy that they don’t get any time for ‘development’ that they take so much pride in. Because heaven help us if they manage to do even a portion of what they have done in Gujarat. We can forget getting re-elected ever.” MFM glared at Chachaji. “Are we here to to appease her fears or to increase them?” He thought. “But don’t worry ma’am. We won’t allow that to happen. Trust us.” He said out aloud, trying to retrieve the situation. She wasn’t fully convinced, but was in a slightly better mood by the time the two left. Back in the car, the two heaved a sigh of relief. “Tell me Chachaji,” MFM asked “Even if we place ourselves at an advantage in 2019 as planned, what will we do about the Prince? We can never win with him at the helm.” “I’ve thought of that too.” Said the wily old fox grinning ear to ear. “We give him a free run the next few years. Make him believe that he’s the biggest leader since Gandhiji, feed him only what he wants to hear. He will do what he’s best at – shoot himself on his foot so many times that by the time elections come around, he’ll be ready to step down on his own.” “That’s when I will take over.” Both of them thought, but said nothing.",2018-01-17,"2014 elections,2019 elections,ecosystem,establishment,fiction,Government,madam,opposition",How the ecosystem lives among us – A short story,https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/how-the-ecosystem-lives-among-us-a-short-story/
738,Sanghamitra,"You read that right. We are serious and we are really concerned. Because contrary to popular belief most of us Indians do love Rahul Gandhi and are concerned about his issues. We have all seen adorable pictures of his childhood as a dimple-cheeked, beautiful boy growing up in the palatial premises of 10 Janpath or celebrating his birthday aboard an international flight with his illustrious family surrounding him. We are so used to the images of his happy, privileged, picturesque childhood that the very idea of a possible chronic childhood phobia haunting our beloved prince is very unsettling for us and the recent events have led us to be more certain of what we had long suspected. Rahul Gandhi might have a condition called “Chrysophobia” or more accurately and less commonly known as Sandarakinophobia. Sandarakinos is the Greek word for the colour orange. (yeah, the vain Greeks and their grandiose terms! we thought so too). It is a real condition, people. And before you laugh it off, please pause and ask yourselves, don’t we all suffer from at least one kind of phobia? Spiders, cockroaches, heights, snakes, darkness, driving and the likes? Is it so uncommon? Why do most people tend to laugh it off? It is unfair. It is perfectly common and normal to have a phobia so save your cynical mind’s judgement of our beloved prince to yourselves. The phobia is real. if you have doubts, google it and you will find that at least 250,000 Americans suffer from it. We are certain that many Indians have it too, though they would never admit. The fear comes from a bad experience in early life involving the colour orange (or, well, saffron). Incidents such as spilling orange juice all over oneself, or being left alone in an orange coloured room, of being bullied or humiliated before  classmates by splash of orange paint etc. People who have it, harbour a chronic fear of all things orange. Extreme cases might even see the person sleeping through the night, to avoid artificial lights, avoid buying anything orange, avoid looking at anything orange and some even avoid looking at the rising sun! Our suspicions rose from the day Rahul Gandhi started being actively involved in politics. For he has been vocally opposed to anything saffron. From criticising RSS (they carry saffron flags) to Yogi Adityanath (because of his  More recently Rahul Gandhi spoke  against the proposal for issue of new orange coloured passports for people with ECR status and his aversion to the colour was evident. His party, Congress, has gone one step ahead and stood behind their prince to mainstream his phobia. They released a video titled “Orange is the new Blue” Now, it did not take us long to realise that it is not his concern for citizens being discriminated against but his phobia speaking.  the MEA did make a proposal for issuing new passports with the orange coloured jacket, but that was NOT to discriminate among citizens. We already have three existing colours for passports. Blue for the public, Maroon for diplomats and White for officials. The statement  issued by the MEA clarified further on this matter. There was a larger concern of doing away with the last page of the passport for the sake of single parents and adopted children. Rahul Gandhi may not be aware of this but the MEA’s decision of NOT making it compulsory for single and divorced women to mention the name of their husband or the father of the child was wholeheartedly welcomed by women of the country. Imagine a single mother having to run to a passport office again and again because she could not include the name of the father of her child. Wasn’t that discriminatory? Imagine a person who has fallen out with either or both his parents and does not want to include their name (s/) in his/her passport. Citizens did face such problems. Wasn’t that discriminatory? Moreover, as different colour-coded government documents are not something new in India and state governments issue even different coloured ration card  based on the income of families, we became certain Rahul Baba’s outrage against the proposed new passports can only be rooted in his phobia. The statement of the MEA has made it clear that the new orange-jacketed passport norm will be applicable to only the passports with ECR status and that too only when their current passports expire. Any attempts to paint this issue in class divide and apartheid colours (pun intended) is pure disillusion and that brings us to the only real issue at hand, Rahul baba’s fear of the orange colour. We get you, Rahul, we get your fears. It was totally unsympathetic for your party men to make a video that flashes more orange light than mirrors inside a bright orange room, or a bright sunrise in the morning (sorry for the mental image). We stand with you. You have nothing to fear from these new passports, as they are little things people carry in their pockets and they will only help MEA to assist ordinary citizens who have not qualified class 10th level and go to find employment in conflict-prone countries .

739,OpIndia Staff,"Supporters of the Narendra Modi led NDA government have often bemoaned its utter inability to create an ecosystem of its own and have often been left flustered by the members of the BJP endorsing the very people who malign their reputation every single day of the week, apart from wishing ill to the party leaders and supporters. Sunetra Choudhury, a journalist at the NDTV, who infamously expressed excitement  at the thought of Narendra Modi suffering from swine flu, is now a valued guest at an event hosted by the government headed by the same Modi who survived the ‘exciting’ flu. Sunetra is now a ‘special invitee’ to an event organized by the Bureau of Police Research and Development under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Modi government seems to be suffering from a terrible case of masochism. This isn’t the first time that Sunetra has been endorsed by the BJP. Not too long ago, senior party leader and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley  released her book at an event in New Delhi. On another occasion, Niti Aayog  had announced NDTV as its media partner for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit which was was co-hosted by the government institution. Social Media users had expressed their anger then too, for the inclusion of NDTV in the event. Needless to say, supporters on Twitter are not happy this time around as well: Social Media outrages in the past have proven to be useful though on some occasions. There was an event organized by the Swedish Embassy  which was cancelled following an outrage against the embassy and Maneka Gandhi for inviting an abusive journalist to the event which linked Press Freedom with online trolling. Similarly, Ministry of Textiles had cancelled an MoU with NDTV after social media users expressed displeasure over the association. However, the BJP it seems can not get out of its habit of appeasing the very people who hate them the most. In spite of all the outrages, it’s always only a matter of time until the government invites another of its haters to one of its events. One wonders that why would a biased media contemplate a course correction when its transgressions are being so richly rewarded?",2018-01-18,"anger,Hatred,Journalists,media bias,modi government,Narendra Modi,NDTV,Outrage,Social Media,sunetra choudhury,Twitter",Journalist who was excited at Modi getting swine flu is now ‘special invitee’ at an event by Modi govt,https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/journalist-who-was-excited-at-modi-getting-swine-flu-is-now-special-invitee-at-an-event-by-modi-govt/
740,Abhishek Banerjee,"I will admit it. When BJP named Yogi Adityanath as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, I was so excited that my hands were shaking. Like a week after sweeping the ‘seculars’ out with a 325/404 landslide, the BJP rubbed salt on their raw wounds by placing saffron clad Yogi as CM. I wondered if my heart was strong enough to take so much happiness in such a short time. Rivers of liberal tears. I wish I could have frozen that moment and lived in it forever. But I write this post to express and put on record my growing unhappiness with the journey of Yogi Adityanath and more importantly the conduct of BJP supporters around him. Actually, it’s not like Yogi Adityanath has done something I disapprove of,  Yogi has been CM of Uttar Pradesh for less than a year. He hasn’t actually done anything yet to deserve the level of adulation he is getting from a section of BJP supporters. Somebody needs to put this on a wall so that ‘right wingers’ can read this everyday. Obviously, it’s not Yogi’s fault. Who can transform a state, that too one as large as Uttar Pradesh with misgovernance of decades, in just 10 months? But the fact remains that Yogi is unproven. That’s just a hard truth. I know many BJP supporters see their future leader in him. And I can understand that. But please remember that he is unproven as yet and any premature adulation will only make him less likely to do the things he actually needs to do to become BJP’s next big leader. So, if you are a true well wisher of Yogi Adityanath, for goodness sake, STOP!!! STOP talking about him as a future Prime Minister or the next Modi. Right now there are only two similarities that I can see in Yogi and Modi — both have crazy fans and crazier haters. The haters especially will help Yogi grow in stature, but Modi grew in stature not just because of his haters, but because of his hard work too. That’s where Yogi needs to prove himself. Remember that Modi became Modi because his path was full of thorns. Please go back down memory lane and see what Modi did, how hard he worked to emerge as No. 1. You know, Narendra Modi made Gujarat into the first state in India with 24 hour domestic power supply. At a time when the rest of the country would pray that electricity comes at least once a day, Gujaratis had power round the clock. You know, Narendra Modi built trauma centers in every little village in Gujarat. Ambulances in Gujarat arrive within 10-15 minutes. For nearly a decade, Gujarat saw nearly double digit growth in agricultural production despite being essentially a desert state. Not to mention that Modi turned Gujarat into a heaven for investors and industries. For 10 continuous years from 2002 to 2012, there was no curfew for a single day in a single corner of Gujarat. That was Modi’s Gujarat. I remember when Modi spoke boldly at a rally in Uttar Pradesh, targetting Mulayam Singh Yadav in these words: “ He could say it with confidence because he knew what he had achieved for the people of Gujarat. Modi’s Gujarat was not built in a day.  It was this process of building Gujarat that molded Narendra Modi into the leader he is today. There are at least four clear reasons for why the right-wing needs to scale down its adulation of Yogi Adityanath (1) Your premature adulation hurts Yogi Adityanath himself. You are making the man complacent instead of hard working. (2) You are insulting the decade long hard work of Narendra Modi in Gujarat that he did to emerge as India’s leader No. 1 (3) You are in some way embracing the worst of the same Congress culture you despise. Rahul Gandhi is a god for them simply because of his family name. Don’t let Yogi become a god for you simply because he wears saffron. If you start giving people things they don’t deserve, you are no better than a Congressi. (4) People are ultimately very smart. They can see through artificial euphoria around a personality. Akhilesh had plenty of it going into the 2017 election. But people see work. Unnecessary euphoria without work actually pisses off the electorate. Again, this is not to say that Yogi isn’t doing anything. He has made a great start with going after criminals in Uttar Pradesh, with improving the roads, filling potholes, asking for property records to be linked to Aadhar to hit benami property and more. I wrote previously about how his efforts on controlling spread of diseases are bearing fruit . But that’s all it is. A great start. Nothing more. Nothing less. Let’s leave it at that. Of course, there are valid criticisms that you can make against me here. You can say this: But Chaiwallah, you started this article talking about how excited you were when Yogi was made CM. How dare you mock others for being excited about him? My answer : point taken and accepted with humility. In my defense, I will say that I have tried my best to tone down my own exhilaration and tried to be objective in evaluating the man. Maybe I succeeded, maybe I didn’t. You decide and feel free to make fun of me if you want. But please, please don’t let this detract from the real issue of how the right-wing is going overboard (and hurting its own interest) through its premature adulation towards Yogi.",2018-01-19,"bjp supporters,development,Elections,Governance,gujarat,Narendra Modi,Opinions,Uttar Pradesh,Yogi Adityanath","To Yogi Adityanath fans, yes, he may become the Prime Minister, if you allow and make him work",https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/to-yogi-adityanath-fans-yes-he-may-become-the-prime-minister-if-you-allow-and-make-him-work/
741,OpIndia Staff,"Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi created a furore a few days back when in an interview  to Pakistani TV channel Geo TV, he refereed to terrorist and 26/11 attack mastermind Hafeez Saeed as “Sahab”, and claimed that no case was registered against Saeed due to which no action can be taken against him. Abbasi took over from Nawaz Sharif in August 2017, after the latter got embroiled in the Panama Papers scandal. Following this statement by Abbasi, the US state department has now come-up with a press statement  slamming the Pakistani PM’s quip about no statement being registered against Hafiz Saeed: In the video shared by Republic TV editor Aditya Raj Kaul, the US state department’s spokesperson Heather Nauert acknowledged that her department had noticed the reports about no case being registered against Hafeez Saeed. Nauert claimed that they regard Saeed as a terrorist, who they believe was the mastermind of 26/11 terror attack. She further asserted that the US believes that Saeed should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Some might argue that this aggressive stance against Pakistan and its practice of harbouring terrorists comes after US President Donald Trump went on a Twitter rant  against the nation by claiming that, United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years. He also claimed that Pakistan gives safe haven to terrorists which the US hunts for in Afghanistan. Also as seen in the past year, certain actions by the Trump administration, might provide a faint glimmer of hope that the noose is tightening on the supporters of terror in the Pakistani establishment. We had reported  how, the US had proposed to convert Pakistan’s grant to buy military hardware, into a loan. Later it was also reported  that Pakistan was to receive US defence aid only if it managed to show sufficient progress in fighting terrorism.",2018-01-19,"Donald Trump,hafiz saeed,India,Pakistan,Prime Minister,Terrorism,US State Department,USA","Watch: US state department demands Hafiz Saeed’s prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, slams Pakistan",https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/watch-us-state-department-demands-hafiz-saeeds-prosecution-to-the-fullest-extent-of-the-law-slams-pakistan/
742,OpIndia Staff,"Subramanian Swamy has dropped another bombshell on Twitter claiming he has been delivered a big lead which would speed up proceedings in the National Herald case. Advocate and close aide of Subramanian Swamy, Ishkaran Singh Bhandari, has described it as a ‘nuclear bomb’. Mr. Bhandari who has admitted that he cannot reveal more details has indicated a ‘big development’ in the case tomorrow. Mr. Swamy has confirmed his aide’s statement and assured that speedy proceedings tomorrow onward. The National Herald case has proven to be a thorn in the side of the Gandhi family thus far. After paying just Rs. 5 lakh to form a company called ‘Young India’, the Mother and Son duo allegedly managed to acquire assets of the National Herald worth Rs. 5000 crores. Additionally they allegedly earned rent to the tune of Rs. 60 lakh per month after renting out the press area property. Essentially, Subramanian Swamy has accused Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, among others, of cheating and misappropriation of funds. Last year in May, the Gandhis were dealt a huge blow  when the Delhi High Court dismissed a plea to stay proceedings against Young India in the National Herald case and cleared the path for an Income Tax Probe into Young India Private Ltd. for its involvement in the case. The Mainstream Media seems overeager to give the Gandhis a free pass  in the matter but unfortunately for them, the matter will be resolved in the Court of Law and not the newsrooms of news channels. Subramanian Swamy in the past has displayed an uncanny knack of sniffing  up a case of corruption before anyone else could. For instance, it was Subramanian Swamy who had first written to the Prime Minister to prosecute A Raja for his involvement in the 2G scam. And it was him who had first filed a case against the Late Jayalalithaa in the Disproportionate Assets case for which she was convicted in the September of 2014. The 20th of January promises to be very exciting for BJP supporters who have been yearning for some sort of concrete action against the Congress bigwigs.
